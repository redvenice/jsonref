The most expensive collection of 5,800 pogs we saw went for £215 earlier this yearIn light of the new game, we took a look on eBay to see how much original pogs were selling for. There are hundreds of listing for pogs worldwide, both limited edition pogs and general collections of them.The most valuable UK sale we found was for a collection of more than 5,800 pogs in a variety of different themes, including a Star Wars collection, which sold for £215 in March this year.          Job-lot collections of pogs are selling on eBay for an average of £20 for around 200 discsNext was a set of the special edition ‘Chupa Caps – City People Series’ in green which went for £122, then a similar set of \u0027Chupa Caps\u0027 in glow in the dark for £90.88. Several people had also sold job lots of random pogs, with one of 4,009 discs for £80.The average price of those we found were between  £20 and £50 for collections of at least a few hundred pogs, or those which contained some special edition designs. Even some unfinished sets were being sold, with one part set of the \u0027Batman Power Caps\u0027 series selling for £21 in April this year.Inidual pogs and slammers, were also selling on eBay but these are a lot less and going for an average of £1 - £2.           The new Pog game will let users scan in images of their retro pogs for in-game creditsTherefore if you do have a collection left over from the 90s, you could try your hand at selling them online. The new game is being created by the London-based firm Compton Technology which has just launched an Indigogo campaign to raise funds to design the game. The target is $50,000 and it’s reached $5,947 already with 106 backers and a month to go.The free game, named POGS AR, is due to be released in September for android and iPhone users and it’s the first officially licensed mobile game from the World Pog Federation, the biggest seller of pogs in the UK.It will include all the original features of the 90s game – including flipping and slamming – but through a mobile app.          A limited edition physical pog is available for people who back the campaign earlyUsers will be able to scan existing pogs and unlock extra content, earn physical prizes, take part in slamming matches with other players and compete in regular tournaments. For those backing the funding campaign, there will be extra perks available including a limited-edition physical slammer, special in-game content, a custom designed pog character and early access to the game.Sam Park, director of Compton Technology, said: ‘Pogs blend two things people love to do - compete and collect. \u0027But in pogs you play for keeps and must risk losing some of your collection to expand it, so the excitement and intensity increases as you play.          This collection of almost 500 pogs sold on eBay for £31 earlier this year‘By going digital and applying modern technology like AR to the original concept, we’re creating a game community and collectible ecosystem that I believe can be even bigger than the original.’  As the new game is due to launch in September,  the number of people flogging their old pogs online could increase over the next couple of months and therefore the overall value you can sell them for will go down as more people hunt theirs out to sell on. But conversely, as interest grows there may be more buyers, which could also affect the price. On the other hand, if you want to get involved with playing the new game – it could be worth hanging onto the pogs as the designers say you will be able to scan them in and use them with it.One year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/16/0BD47D2700000578-5822003-image-a-78_1528473463922.jpg","title":"Pippa Middleton pregnant Duchess Cambridges sister due","story":"    Pippa Middleton and James Matthews arrive  for the wedding of Meghan and Prince HarryWho is Pippa Middleton?Born Philippa Charlotte Middleton on September 6, 1983, she is an English socialite, most famous for being the sister of Prince William’s wife, Kate Middleton and garnered media attention after attending their Royal Wedding.After attending high profile schools, she embarked on a career in public relations before moving to event planning company Table Talk.

The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.          TRAGEDY OF IRAQ VET: Ex-Royal Marine Dave Evans, who served in Iraq, is suspected to have committed suicide this yearThe suspected suicides of frontline veterans this year also include an elite Special Boat Service (SBS) trooper found hanged in his room at the unit’s base in Poole, Dorset, last month, and Dave Evans, a former Marine who served in Iraq.British military operations in Iraq began in March 2003 and concluded in May 2011. During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late. Everyone close to someone in danger has a role to play.Everyone realises there is a problem but nobody is complacent. The ongoing challenge is to ensure that those who need help actually get it.We must all do more – the Government, the NHS and the military charities."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/08/4D19C0D400000578-5825717-image-a-24_1528615019459.jpg","title":"David Walliams puts 5 35M north London home market 2M paid it","story":"David Walliams has placed his north London house on the market for £2million more than her paid for it 13 years ago          The master bedroom has integrated wardrobes as well as am open-plan en-suite with a freestanding bath and plenty of open spaceThe real Lost Voice Guy: How son of a cancer nurse Lee...Share this articleThe expansive pad was where he lived with ex-wife and model Lara Stone and before that it was owned by Oasis superstar Noel Gallagher.It was dubbed Supernova heights in the nineties because of the extravagant parties its former owner threw.The house boasts a stylish living area, an extensive garden, a roof terrace and private parking.

Recent storms have shifted sands to reveal the 17th century cannons and anchors off the coast of CornwallTheir accounts of the final voyage of the ship is known in remarkable detail because a pamphlet was published a few months after the wrecking.The title of the pamphlet is \u0027A full ACCOUNT Of the late Ship-wreck of the Ship called The PRESIDENT: Which was cast away in Montz-Bay in Cornwal On the 4th of February last, As it was deliver\u0027d to HIS MAJESTY, (both in Writing and Discourse) By William Smith and John Harshfield, the only Persons that escaped in the said Wreck\u0027.The tale goes that as the President set off for home the crew were involved in a deadly battle with pirates off the Malabar Coast of India.Six pirate ships set upon the merchant ship, but the battle was won when a shot from one of the President\u0027s cannons penetrated a pirate powder magazine, sinking the ship.          The East India Company ship President met her end in February 1684, and only two crew members remained alive to tell the taleBut that victory was followed by misery and defeat, as weather prohibited the crew from landing to restock provisions.For 11 weeks they went without food and water, and in the end resorted to eating the ship\u0027s dog - which was described as \u0027a delicate banquet\u0027.With the crew in a weakened state they were unable to work the ship, and the President was swept into a storm just off the Cornish Coast, in Mount\u0027s Bay.The ship sank with \u0027very rich lading, modestly judged of no less than a hundred thousand pounds * with much treasure of pearl, and diamonds\u0027.

Was it when the first colony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607? Or with the detonation of the first atomic bombs? Some suggest it started with the mass production of plastics which now intermingle with rocks in the ocean bed.In The Human Planet Lewis and Maslin suggest the dawn of colonialism as the advent of the Anthropocene.They argue that 1610 was the true start.          The arrival of Europeans in the Americas triggered the Anthropocene, the book says. Pictured: Fur traders in Canada\u0027The arrival of Europeans, in particular the British and Spanish, had a profound impact on central and southern America,\u0027 Maslin told the Observer.Settlers and soldiers carried European diseases like smallpox, measles, typhoid and the flu.These killed as many as 50 million Americans who has no resistance to their foreign illnesses.With the death of so many of the continents native people forests began to regrow where farmland had once been tended to.By using carbon dioxide readings from the period they calculated that by 1610 forests had reclaimed much of the continent.Forests are more effective at absorbing carbon dioxide than crops and therefore the reforestation of farmland would have led to a drop in carbon dioxide.          At least 50 million Americans were killed during the colonisation of the Americas. Pictured: A market in the West IndesRats and other pests carried on ships across the Atlantic had a stark effect on local species.\u0027A good example is provided by the earthworm. In the US, most of the earthworms you will find there are actually European, said Maslin.\u0027They are better at competing for nutrients. So they have taken over the soil in North America since Europeans brought them across the Atlantic in the 16th century. That is not something you can unpick. They are there for good.\u0027In turn America\u0027s own produce changed the terrain of other continents. In just decades Europeans were eating potatoes and tomatoes while Chinese and Indian cuisine has absorbed the heat of the American pepper.In China newly imported maize was planted in lands previously thought too dry to be farmed.This led to more deforestation and population increase.With the pace of technological advancement only increasing it appears the Anthropocene is here to stay.Predicting its course is difficult, the authors admit.

Campaigners fear there has been a decline in press freedom because of the adoption of privacy laws introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights, and developed by lawyers hired by politicians and celebrities keen to hide their antics from the public.The celebrity in the threesomes and olive oil bathing parties case – who could be known only as PJS – had hired lawyers charging £600 an hour to fight his corner.A High Court judge initially rejected the star\u0027s demand for a gagging order, but the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court overturned the decision, ensuring his name was kept from those unwilling to scour the internet.They ruled the celebrity\u0027s right to privacy outweighed the public interest. The fact that children were involved was also a factor.Lord Mance also told The Sunday Telegraph judges are immune from attempts to influence them over the internet, adding: \u0027We are trained not to be influenced.\u0027If people started to believe as a result of trolling or media that judges were doing just what they liked and giving effect to their personal preferences rather than applying the hallowed system of common law and statute law honestly and diligently... they would be very mistaken.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/08/4D2026A800000578-5827801-image-m-16_1528703350758.jpg","title":"Winnie Harlow blames race officials ending Canadian Grand Prix prematurely","story":"    Formula One guest Harlow is seen waving the flag on the 69th circuit of the 70-lap race          Model Winnie Harlow waves the checkered flag at the end of the Canadian Grand Prix  Race winner Sebastian Vettel recognized that the flag had been issued too earlyBody language expert breaks down THAT famous photo from the...\u0027Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade\u0027: Trump rips...\u0027He destroyed our trust in 280 characters\u0027: German minister...Share this article\u0027When they tell you to wave the flag a lap too early,\u0027 the 23-year-old said in a post on Instagram. \u0027You had one job sir!\u0027\u0027So grateful everyone was safe today and no one got hurt.\u0027As a result of the error, the timings were therefore taken based on the positions of the race on lap 68, according to article 43.2 of the Formula 1 sporting regulations. Daniel Ricciardo\u0027s fastest lap on lap 69 was expunged as a result of the error, handing the prize instead to Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen.

The East India Company ship President met her end in February 1684, and only two crew members remained alive to tell the taleBut that victory was followed by misery and defeat, as weather prohibited the crew from landing to restock provisions.For 11 weeks they went without food and water, and in the end resorted to eating the ship\u0027s dog - which was described as \u0027a delicate banquet\u0027.With the crew in a weakened state they were unable to work the ship, and the President was swept into a storm just off the Cornish Coast, in Mount\u0027s Bay.The ship sank with \u0027very rich lading, modestly judged of no less than a hundred thousand pounds * with much treasure of pearl, and diamonds\u0027.

She has been appropriated by curators, historians, artists, actors, activists, Mexican consulates, museums and Madonna.Over the years, this avalanche has trivialised Kahlo’s work to fit a shallow “Fridolatry”. And, while some criticism has been able to counter the views that cast her as a naive, infantile, almost involuntary artist, most narratives have continued to position her as a geographically marginal painter: one more developing-world artist waiting to be “discovered”, one more voiceless subject waiting to be “translated”.In 1938, Frida Kahlo painted Lo que el agua me dio (What the Water Gave Me), the painting perhaps responsible for launching her international career, but also her international mistranslation. In this self-portrait of sorts, we see Kahlo’s feet and calves inside a bathtub and above them, as if emanating from the steam, a collaged landscape: an erupting volcano out of which a skyscraper emerges a dead bird resting on a tree a strangled woman a Tehuana dress dramatically spread out a female couple resting on a floating cork. Kahlo was working on Lo que el agua me dio when the French surrealist André Breton arrived in Mexico for a visit. He was transfixed by it. He called Kahlo a “natural surrealist”, and in a brochure endorsing her New York debut at Julien Levy’s gallery in 1938, he wrote: “My surprise and joy were unbounded when I discovered, on my arrival in Mexico, that her work has blossomed forth, in her latest paintings, into pure surreality, despite the fact that it had been conceived without any prior knowledge whatsoever of the ideas motivating the activities of my friends and myself.”Though “natural surrealist” was a label that helped translate Kahlo’s paintings for European and American audiences, it was one that she always rejected. To be projected as a “surrealist” in Europe helped audiences to understand her work more immediately – more palatably. She was branded as authentically Mexican, with international flair. But to be seen as a “natural surrealist” also transformed her into a kind of sauvage: unconscious of her talent, unsuspecting of her mastery. After her debut, a Time magazine critic described her work as having “the daintiness of miniatures, the vivid reds and yellows of Mexican tradition and the playfully bloody fancy of an unsentimental child.”Kahlo was hardly unsuspecting, hardly unconscious of what she was doing and who she was. She knew how to capitalise on the elements of her private life and cultural heritage, curate them carefully, and use them to build her public persona. She was a mestizo, born in Mexico City, who had adopted a traditional Zapotec-Tehuana “look”. Her father, the German-born Carl Wilhelm “Guillermo” Kahlo, was a well-known photographer, and the family lived in a neocolonial mansion in Coyoacán, the famous Casa Azul. Kahlo was very much aware of the complex politics of selfhood she was creating and manipulating. In a 1939 photograph taken during the opening of Kahlo’s first exhibition in Paris, she is posing in front of Lo que el agua me dio. She is wearing a Tehuana dress and her unibrow is underscored with black eyeliner: Frida representing Frida. (It is unclear which one is the artwork.)The way Kahlo’s work and persona were read in Mexico was of course very different from the way they were translated into other cultural milieux. Just as Breton had attached the category “natural surrealist” to her art and framed her work in a discourse that she herself did not embrace, many others did the same with various aspects of her public and private life.An interesting example of this is the house and studio in Mexico City where she and Diego Rivera lived and worked during some of their most productive years in the 1930s. It was designed by Juan O’Gorman, the young architect who was then pioneering the radical architectural changes that took place in post-revolutionary Mexico City.Before the Mexican Revolution (1910-20), 19th-century neoclassical and colonial architecture dominated. French-influenced mansions across the city stood like lonely homages to a quickly decaying European noble class, and the family life of the Mexican bourgeoisie played out in the sumptuous and darkened stages of these interiors, with their heavy drapes and excessive ornamentation. But after the revolution new ideas about hygiene, ventilation, comfort, efficiency and simplicity made their way into the city. Houses, and with them daily life, were transformed radically and rapidly.Attuned to the ideological and architectural changes taking place, the couple asked O’Gorman to design a studio and house for them. He created a space specifically for a couple of painters – at once separated and connected. The buildings were the first in Mexico designed for specific functional requirements: living, painting and showcasing work.In 1933, a few years after Kahlo and Rivera married, they moved in. Rivera’s area was larger, with more work space. Kahlo’s was more “homely”, with a studio that could transform into a bedroom. A flight of stairs led from her studio to a rooftop, which was connected by a bridge to Rivera’s space. Beyond being a workplace, it became a space for the couple’s extramarital affairs: Rivera, with his models and secretaries Kahlo, with certain talented and famous men, from the sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi to Leon Trotsky. Perhaps without knowing it, O’Gorman designed a house whose function it was to allow an “open” relationship.The house was an emblem of modernity and a kind of manifesto: a solitary example of a new functionalism in a city that was still trying to find a national architectural language that best suited its revolutionary programme. It did not encode traditional values or messages. It simply addressed the practical necessities of its dwellers, was materially efficient (primarily made of reinforced concrete), socially progressive and cheap.With time, however, as neutral as the buildings may have been intended to be in their architecture, they ended up functioning as a site of Mexican cultural capital, especially one connected to indigenous Mexican craftsmanship. The couple were hosts to visitors who came to see their work and works-in-progress, as well as their collections of arts and crafts: Trotsky, Nelson Rockefeller, Pablo Neruda, John Dos Passos, Sergei Eisenstein, Breton.O’Gorman gave Rivera and Kahlo a machine to live in, as Le Corbusier would have had it, but also a machine to translate in. Their home brought in foreignness as much as it served as a platform to project a particular idea of Mexico to the world. More than anything, it provided the stage for the power couple of Mexican modernity: cosmopolitan, sophisticated, well-connected and more Mexican than Mexico. The couple’s ultimate oeuvre was, of course, themselves. Kahlo and Rivera were, perhaps, Mexico’s first performance artists, and their casa-estudio was their very own gallery.The buildings were designed to embody a proletkult ideology, resembling a factory or industrial complex, with its visible water tanks, its exposed materials and raised supporting columns. The cacti fence surrounding the house, if seen in relation to it, added to the general industrial feeling. However, Harper’s chose the image that best decontextualised the cacti fence and thus presented it as a folkloric, decorative element. To the right of that central image appeared a series of photographs of barefooted Mexican peasants selling crafts and riding mules.An accompanying piece written by Harry Block – a New York editor – describes his search for the perfect Mexican sandals: “All Mexico walks on huaraches (pronounced wahratchehs and meaning sandals) …” Juxtaposed with the portrait of Rivera and Kahlo – he, dressed like a European dandy, solid leather shoes included she, wearing pointy black boots – Block’s ode to the huarache seems rather forced.The Harper’s piece is a perfect example of how Mexico was perpetuated in such stories as a marginal space, with glimpses of modernity a rare exception to the rule. The magazine shows an utterly foreign Mexico, but in a way that also makes it easier to capture and explain to foreign audiences through its associated cliches. It is a form of translation that simplifies the complex operations that took place in the Rivera-Kahlo home.A functionalist Mexican house that showcased post-revolutionary art? Impossible! Let’s just use the picture with the cacti.This instance of colonising narratives in cultural translations was not the end but the beginning. In 2002, Harvey Weinstein’s company distributed the film Frida, starring Salma Hayek, asked for a more-sexy Kahlo – more nudity, less unibrow – and got away with it. In a 2016 concert stunt in Mexico, Madonna pulled a Frida lookalike from the audience, said she was “so excited” to finally meet Frida, and then handed her a banana as a token.Last Halloween, my 21-year-old niece was dragged by her friend to a New York college party. She wasn’t wearing a costume, was not really in the mood. At some point, a trio of Wonder Women stumbled in: red knee-high boots, star print bikini-bottoms, strapless tops, gold headbands fastened around long blond hair.One of the three wonders took a long swig from a bottle and almost fell back, suddenly noticing my niece, standing behind her. She turned round and looked straight into her face. She studied it up close. Like many women in my maternal family, my niece inherited a dark, robust unibrow. The Wonder Woman finally said: “Oh my god, it’s Frida Kahlo!”.• Valeria Luiselli’s Tell Me How It Ends is published by 4th Estate.

Deloitte, which was appointed as administrator on Friday, said Poundworld would trade as usual while it sought a buyer for all or part of the business, adding that no redundancies or store closures were planned.At Poundworld in Hyde, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain’s demise. “What a shame,” said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. “If someone comes to nick my chickens they’re not to know it’s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes,” she said.Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny: “At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for £1. It’s £1.50 at the supermarket,” she said.Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of glow sticks for £1 each and some bin bags. She said: “I didn’t think a place like this would close. I’m in every week buying things I don’t need.”Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire pudding mix.One of Poundworld’s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetics outlet. Next to that is B\u0026ampM Bargains, a northern chain that recently announced plans to open 45 stores in southern England. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Jack Fulton, the Yorkshire frozen food retaile , and it’s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice.Two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with the private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with Poundworld’s owners, TPG Capital, a US private equity firm.Chris Edwards, who founded the business in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1974 before selling it to TPG for £150m, is also thought to have been interested in buying back the business.Deloitte’s joint administrator, Clare Boardman, said: “The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. “Unfortunately, this has not been possible. We still believe a buyer can be found for the business, or at least part of it, and we are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen. We thank all employees for their support at this difficult time.A TPG spokesperson said: “This was a difficult decision for every party involved. We invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees. “Despite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.”The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the relative health of Poundworld’s rival Poundland, despite a crowded marketplace for discount retailers, indicated the business had been poorly managed.“Poundland is doing OK, despite the general pressure on the high street pound chains from the growth of B\u0026ampM and Home Bargains in food and toiletries and the growth of Aldi and Lidl,” he said.“So it must be down to management, and I suspect Poundworld lost a lot of momentum when the founder, Chris Edwards, stepped back from the business.”The demise of Poundworld follows the collapse into administration this year of the electronics firm Maplin and Toys R Us.The high street has also been rocked by a succession of retailers and restaurant chains announcing plans to shut stores amid tougher trading conditions.House of Fraser announced plans last week to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of outlets after creditors approved company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), insolvency procedures that enable them to reduce rents and shut shops.Restaurants including Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian have also closed outlets using the process.Poundworld’s problems surfaced in April when its owner was said to be considering launching a CVA, affecting about 100 stores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef29e68000139f7e9cafc9bc8e0a532e75f40cef/1445_0_7809_4689/master/7809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3f06b7bb67ae641a666a6a278e754c","title":"copenhagenize case urban cycling graphs","story":"Danish-Canadian urban designer Mikael Colville-Andersen busts some common myths and shows how the bicycle has the potential to transform cities around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584274b1603d1c3eb42975f74b3d7d2bd9603802/0_28_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86adb22e51acd1165dd11b66234fbce8","title":"french surrealism big chains high streets small business","story":"Growing up in Liverpool in the 1970s, I remember a time when you couldn’t get a decent cup of coffee anywhere. This was very troubling for me, a wannabe French surrealist shacked up in gloomy Garston. Those surrealists used to drink a lot of coffee. They liked to talk and hang out in cafes. And with all that caffeine inside them, afterwards they liked to walk the city streets. In those streets, they said, you could discover novelty and chance encounter. That’s the meaning of life in the city, they said, novelty.A bit later, I read Jane Jacobs. She wrote a great book in the early 1960s called The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Jacobs drank more gin than coffee. She particularly liked her local – New York’s White Horse Tavern, on the same Greenwich Village block she lived. Jacobs didn’t much like what planners had done to cities both sides of the Atlantic, nor what they were to mastermind. They peddled the silly idea that functional separation was the way forward, that spaces should have mono-uses – work here, residence there, leisure someplace else. Jacobs said this destroyed the mixed land uses and ersity that made neighbourhoods vibrant, that brought life to cities of all shapes and sizes. The city block that worked best, she said, was the block “with high-yield, middling-yield, low-yield, and no-yield enterprises”.Decades on, weird things have happened to our cities. Since Margaret Thatcher’s day, we have not had much planning of the sort Jacobs dissed. The “free” market has decided things. And the free market soon discovered coffee. We have more places nowadays to drink coffee than the surrealist could ever have imagined. We know something’s up when Whitbread, the brewery group, started shutting its pubs and ersified into coffee, supplying us with a Costa on every street corner – or on every other street corner, next to every Co-op, with a Starbucks and Caffè Nero close by. The surrealists can get their caffeine rush. But where, afterwards, would they wander, for that novelty and fleeting delight?Once the famine, lately the feast, an orgy of sameness. Steadily but surely, up and down the country, in that free market our big cites and little towns have become alike. Predictable chain stores dominate, too ubiquitous to mention. Yet now, amid the grumbles, chain giants have had enough, aren’t making enough. So they’re closing stores down in selected towns and cities. Marks \u0026amp Spencer, as part of its “radical restructuring plan”, will close 100 stores by 2022, risking 2,000 jobs – House of Fraser is closing 31 stores with thousands more jobs on the line. Can’t live with them, can’t live without them. The high street we once knew as predictable and boring is destined to become something worse: deserted, boarded-up and jobless. Our public spaces are sterile or else sterile wildernesses. What’s gone wrong? What can be done?I’m old enough to blame it all on Thatcherism. Planning was bad, but no planning is worse. Though it’s not that there isn’t any planning more our local authority planners seem to be bought off by those same big, rich chains.Toys R Us: 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February. Owes £15m in VAT, due by 1 March.Maplin: 200 electronics and gadget stores, founded 1972, also failed on 28 February.Warren Evans:\u0026nbspbedmaker went into administration earlier in February.East: fashion brand with nearly 50 outlets folded in January.Juice Corp: business behind brands including Elizabeth Emanuel and Joe Bloggs went under in January.Multiyork: furniture chain with 50 stores went into administration in November.Feather \u0026amp Black: bedroom furniture and bedding specialist with 25 outlets fell into administration in November.Debenhams, a 178-store chain that is more than 200 years old, is axing one in four of its managers and considering closures to cut costs. It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.Meanwhile, honest planners haven’t been very imaginative. They need to read more French surrealism. And more Jane Jacobs. Nor has the free market been very free. Our cities these days are arenas for high-yields only, for gleaning land rent, for making property pay any way it can. People are priced off the land. Only rich companies can afford to stay put.They monopolise and drive out smaller businesses. At the same time, they abandon areas not worth investing in. Rich people and rich companies see city real estate and central locations as ever more profitable financial investments. After they have driven away competitors, they rule. In the mix, there’s not much mix. And when they overextend, they downsize, leaving people with no alternative.Can’t central government empower local authorities to empower local, independent businesses? Real empowerment, I mean – empowerment of ideas. Many people, lacking money capital, have capital inside their heads awaiting realisation. That’s the alternative. That’s the opportunity. Cities and small towns have lacked any sense of participatory democracy for a long while, and chains are a sure way to foster disempowerment in work and in urban life.Can planners and architects recreate vibrant high street social spaces? Maybe. But what’s needed isn’t an architecture of elitist celebration or bland conformism, but an architecture that creates the conditions for innovative action to occur – action that connects ordinary people, that hooks people up together and helps install new imaginative sorts of urban spaces. Our retreat to online shopping is merely a symptom of high street alienation.Yet it isn’t hi-tech urban design that’s at stake more low-budget city acupuncture, of finding new ways to recreate old stuff, of poking into things meticulously and lovingly to enable sociability – not rolling in roughshod with the bulldozer or with a new Tesco superstore.Some people call this weak architecture: it’s the opposite of designing and constructing immense buildings. It’s about nurturing activities in between strong buildings. It’s more about nurturing street space, developing floor space, re-energising vacant units and dormant high streets, subverting what’s within those spectacular projects. It’s about shaking up the very foundations upon which strong buildings are built. That’s weak architecture’s strength.The essential thing is to construct a human space in which experiential communication can be most effectively transmitted. Physicality morphs into sociality. The more we stay passive objects along a supermarket aisle, the less we actively participate in the production of our own life. Then, things get done to us rather than by us. Our own ability to realise ourselves, to affirm ourselves, is stunted.We’re talking about a new value system for our cites and small towns it’s nothing official, not as yet, but a sovereignty constituted by a going back to the future, back in the sense that the building block for this empowerment is the ancient ideal of a citadin, a person belonging to the city, a citizen belonging to la cité, like the surrealists said – after drinking a lot of coffee.• Andy Merrifield is an urban theorist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345a5d0955e876e81cdfff9e7f1e1c87845915f/0_6_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfda08c47aa221f89dc9e80fb74b66c","title":"trans child be himself understand community","story":"Media discussions about transgender people have taken on a personal significance for me. My son was my daughter until last year, when, after years of hints here and there, and months of him being uncharacteristically tearful and reclusive, he told us he was a boy.My instinct was caution, determined to shield him from wounding words and quizzical looks and the need to navigate out of this if he was wrong. I said, “Let’s not tell anyone at school just yet. You’re only 12. I promise I believe that you believe you’re a boy right now, but what if you tell your friends and then realise you’ve made a mistake?”I worried about boyfriends, girlfriends, online bullying and long memories. My happy child, always off exploring with hordes of kids, might be left behind, too weird to be in the gang. He was quiet, but determined, questioned how long he had to wait. I said until half-term – a few weeks away –and if you still feel the same then, I’ll talk to school about you wearing the boys’ uniform.What I didn’t know then is that people don’t just change their minds about this. I’ve researched and researched and found nothing but evidence confirming that once a person, young or old, comes out, explains their gender isn’t all it seems, that’s that. It isn’t a mistake, a cry for help, or a mental illness – it’s a fact. And the time it most commonly comes to light is when puberty arrives. It’s all so obvious now – it wasn’t then – but the time physical difference becomes apparent is the time the distress of gender dysphoria becomes acute.A week later, a call from school – my son, so upset he couldn’t speak, had gone to a trusted teacher. He couldn’t bear to be thought of as a girl for one more minute. He was a boy, he wanted to dress as a boy, he didn’t want a red pen cross on his Spanish homework when he’d used the masculine to describe himself. We met with his open-minded, compassionate teachers. I was still urging caution – nothing public, not yet, please, just a little more thinking time. What about peers’ reactions? We mustn’t rush. He explained, through tears, that he would rather people bullied him about being a boy than have to carry on pretending he was a girl.And the penny dropped.My son, in his distress, helped me realise that there is something even worse than being abused in the street, and that’s being told by strangers you’re not who you know you are, that the truth of you is not acceptable so if you want to be safe – be normal, please. Being thought of as funny-looking, a weak man or a manly, ugly woman, the titanic social pressure to look your gender, physical discomfort, even pain, are a small price to pay. A baggy jumper in summer heat, chest binders, hormone blockers, side-effects, surgery being more likely to attempt suicide, be homeless, be the victim of violent crime, murder, sexual assault. Certain countries wholly out of bounds, a crime to be you, violence inevitable, media debates that aren’t kind, that make your mother flinch and rush to switch the radio off, change the subject, protect you. Having to be tolerant of intolerance, taking deep breaths and bracing yourself, standing tall – they don’t know how fast your heart is beating, how much your palms are sweating.If you could avoid all that and happily pretend you’re a girl when you know you’re a boy – why wouldn’t you? “Mum, if I could, I probably would, but I can’t because it isn’t who I am.” And there’s the rub – it’s not a choice, it’s a truth. And it can be wonderful.School arranged PE with the other boys, “he” not “she” – and the boys’ uniform, he left the house wearing that and the broadest of smiles. He changed his name – just one letter, but a clear mark of boyhood, a farewell to girlhood. He joined the LGBTQ+ group at school – as did every single one of his magnificent friends. I called his friends’ parents and explained we were proud of him, this wasn’t a dark secret to be discussed in hushed tones. Beautiful reactions from one and all. We are lucky, I know. One offered a friend whose son was transgender and did I want to be put in touch, others asked what they could read to learn more another, unprompted, gave our school WhatsApp group a gender-neutral title, and a mum of a trans child told me about Gendered Intelligence, a life-saving organisation with a trans youth club. I’ve never seen a child look so delighted as my son on his first visit.There will of course be struggles aplenty ahead – even the strong, proud trans role models my son has face a daily struggle. Just being themselves is an act of political controversy. And my son worries for his trans peers. He told me about a friend whose parents don’t accept his gender, that it would be such a relief for him to have a kind place to go, that didn’t cost money, where everyone was nice to him even if he’s wearing boys’ clothes.Then I heard about efforts to create such a place – the LGBTQ+ community centre volunteers are crowdfunding and working hard to set up an open, accessible space for LGBTQ+ people in London. What a door opened for us when we found them. They don’t even have a building, but the community they’ve created already has been transformative: advice about our legal rights, solidarity at moments of struggle, hugs, picnics, real understanding from people who’ve been riding this wave for years. My son spent bank holiday Monday in a park, chatting to an open and generous person who was able to answer all his questions from personal experience. We’re part of a community now – it’s uplifting and gives me hope for a more compassionate future, one where we aren’t the subject of a vitriolic debate.• Molly Mulready is a lawyer and mother of three"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c89877068bfac947ea927931b85c5676ef6b521/0_2333_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2a6dbb5c3f53305fa767d6e7350b9e1","title":"yoga with dogs is crackers but its my kind of crackers woof","story":"If you find every other yoga class awkward and alienating, doga could be just the thing. Ohm. Ohhhhm. Ohhhmmygod, is that wee on the floor?A Belgian shepherd has got snappy with a chow chow, chasing it between the mats. Ten other dogs erupt, like schoolboys egging on a punchup. Things cannot be going to plan, if there even is a plan. The teacher gamely attempts to continue, but I can’t hear what she’s saying. Taking advantage of the mayhem, a bichon frise is truffling in everyone’s bags, looking for rawhide twists. I should explain: I’m in a dog yoga class. Maybe that makes things more confusing.Doga is a system of balancing dogs on the body while in yoga poses. (“If you have a larger dog, use him as a bolster,” says the instructor.) On paper, it is an idea so nauseating it would make Anthea Turner want to declare a fatwa. Designed to nurture a dog’s sacred bond with its owner, it came from California hard to believe. According to our teacher, doga pioneer Mahny Djahanguiri, it’s particularly good for rescues. An owner practising slow and sustained breathing will calm down an anxious animal, whose parasympathetic nervous system will respond in kind. This does sound plausible. Someone should tell the dogs.Thankfully, the class is open to non-owners, too – those who just want to hang with some mutts. A mat neighbour lends me her miniature sheltie, and I spend a\u0026nbspfew minutes hinged at the waist, clutching the impeccably manicured beast, trying not to drip sweat on to it. Extending into warrior pose, I hoist the dog like Rafiki lifting Simba at the start of The Lion King. I don’t know whether the sheltie is loving or merely tolerating this, the way my childhood dog did when I put stickers on him. But the fur is very reassuring.Doga is undoubtedly crackers, but it’s my kind of crackers. I’ve never succeeded in getting into straight yoga, and our society’s obsession with it baffles me. Yoga is an ascetic means of preparing the body for meditation. It’s about unifying with the ine, not looking buff in Lululemon. I mean, imagine if all the Hindus in Uttar Pradesh were shovelling down communion wafers as a low-cal alternative to crisps. That would be weird. Themed yoga should be even more of an aberration. Beer yoga, Harry Potter yoga, horse and goat yoga. What the hell are these? Broga, a fitness programme taught “from a man’s point of view”, replaces asanas with names such as “rock star” and “chill out pose”. A friend of mine swears by Stevie Nicks yoga, where a chiffon-clad instructor replaces devotional mantras with Fleetwood Mac lyrics. The (inaccurate) message is that yoga is fun, secular and customisable: you can go your own way.The thing is, in every other yoga class I feel awkward, Lycra-lumpy, alienated by some Blake Lively-alike telling me I am more than enough. The involvement of dogs changes everything. It’s impossible to feel self-conscious in the presence of a boston terrier curious as to why you are trying to turn into a bridge. Dogs puncture the absurdity of all human behaviours. Have you ever tried sinking into shavasana while a\u0026nbsppomeranian puts its tongue in your ear? Ohm. Ohhhhm. Ohhhmmygod, is that piss on the floor? (Downside: there was quite a lot of piss. Not sure who to blame, but the bichon was looking sheepish.)Forget the rescue animals – at the end of the class, I feel calmer, centred and in the moment. That parasympathetic works both ways. A meeting with God may be elusive, but dogs will never let you down. When it comes to reasons to feel #blessed, they are definitely more than enough. Doga without the dogma: that’s my vibe.Call me TripAdvisor, because I\u0026nbsphave found the least appealing B\u0026ampB in the world. I became aware of it after seeing a shocking video of a crocodile clamping its jaws around a small dog on the banks of Goat Island Lodge, a remote guest house in northern Australia. For 10 years, Pippa the terrier, also known as Dumb Blonde, was famed for chasing Casey the crocodile into the water, until one day the croc snapped. There are some stories you have to take a deep e into.“This is the Kingdom of King Kai, and all the rest of them are my sub-servants,” owner Kai Hansen told Australian ABC last year, giving off unbelievable Island of Dr Moreau vibes. The king, who has a broad smile and no front teeth, came to the island 15 years ago, wanting to escape city life. How bad can Starbucks be, that a crocodile-infested swamp only accessible by an hour’s boat ride is preferable? I\u0026nbspneed to know what his job was, and how a Danish man came to buy an entire island, when most people just go to Center Parcs.Goat Island Lodge receives visitors from all over Australia, keen for a taste of … what? The snacks menu, glimpsed in the ABC video, includes “bit of bull (minced) and Ruffburger (very horny)”. What does one do there? “There was a man living here in the early days. Heard there was a dead croc upriver, disappeared with a chainsaw. Came back smelling so rotten ... I had to burn his clothes.” It’s Hemingway gone utterly wrong.Hansen is essentially un-Googleable, as he shares a name\u0026nbspwith a German heavy metal vocalist. I have to know more. Call me a dumb brunette, but I’m jumping on a fanboat. If I’m not back next week, let’s be honest, I’m probably dead.Curiosity, the Nasa rover, has located an array of organic molecules \u0026nbspin a 3m-year-old lake bed on Mars. Huge news.

Some decisions have been sitting on the desk of the commission for more than three years now, for no apparent reason.“Every day lost through this inaction means more exposure to harmful chemicals, increasing the likelihood of notably cancer, impairment of fertility, as well as long-term catastrophic damage to our ecosystems.”Under the current regulatory system, known as Reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), the ECHA’s scientific committees are in charge of assessing the risks of chemicals.The commission then decides whether companies should be granted authorisation to use substances known to be of “very high concern”.In most cases, companies are free to use the chemicals in question while the commission’s decisions are pending, despite the agency’s concerns.ClientEarth cited as one example the case of DEHP, a plastic-softening chemical found to readily leach from the plastic and to be a hormone-disrupting substance toxic for human reproduction. The scientific committees concluded in 2014 and 2015 that companies requesting authorisation for DEHP were using it without adequately controlling the risks.By the start of this month the commission had not yet adopted a final decision on these cases, meaning companies remained free to continue using the chemical, ClientEarth said.Apolline Roger, another of its lawyers, said: “It is strikingly apparent that the cases where the commission acted most quickly were the cases where the companies could not legally use the chemicals while waiting for the commission’s decision.“It is particularly worrying to see that the commission prioritises business interests but not the protection of human health and the environment when deciding which cases are urgent.”ClientEarth said it had written to the commission to share its findings and to call for it to “correct its maladministration and speed up the authorisation and restriction processes”.A spokesman for the commission said it took human health extremely seriously and strongly rejected claims that it prioritised business interests over health and the environment.A statement said that in the past 10 years the commission had “significantly reduced our citizens’ exposure to harmful chemicals. Overall, more than 17,000 substances in 65,000 registration dossiers of chemicals manufactured and used in the EU have been registered as part of the Reach registration procedure.”The spokesman said the process was being constantly evaluated to “further enhance protection of consumers, workers and the environment”.

On May 15th, the Opinion page published a self-contradictory editorial from the lifelong contrarian and fossil fuel-funded Fred Singer that so badly rejected basic physics, it prompted one researcher to remark, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.”The WSJ did publish a letter to the editor (LTE) from real climate scientists Andrea Dutton and Michael Mann rebutting Singer’s editorial. However, it gave the last word to science deniers in an LTE response rejecting the well-established facts that sea level rise is accelerating and Antarctic is loss is contributing to it.A few days later, the WSJ opinion page was at it again, publishing an editorial by Stephen F. Hayward, who describes himself as having “spent most of my adult life in conservative think tanks in Washington, D.C.,” and it shows. Hayward has a long history as a climate naysayer, ning over a decade back to his days with the fossil fuel-funded American Enterprise Institute.Hayward’s arguments of course deserve to be judged on their own merits. I devoted my first-ever Tweetstorm to doing just that:Hayward falls into the category some describe as “Lukewarmers.” This group consists of people who think that – contrary to the body of available evidence – global warming will be slow and we don’t have to worry much about it. I prefer the term “Luckwarmer,” since they’re betting that Earth’s climate sensitivity is at the very low end or lower than the range of values supported by scientific evidence. In that sense, they’re gambling we’ll be very lucky that the climate dice will come up snake eyes.Throughout his career, Hayward has spilled a lot of ink trolling those who are concerned about climate change. In this latest opinion piece, he argues that “climate change has run its course” because nobody is doing anything serious to solve it, and nobody cares about climate change anymore. Hayward also cites polling data that shows Americans consider climate change a low priority, but neglects to mention that the vast majority (including Trump voters) support climate policies like taxing andor regulating carbon pollution. He compares the issue to a car alarm whose blaring noise everybody soon tunes out. However, unlike a triggered car alarm, climate change poses ever-increasing risks. It won’t just go away if we ignore it. It’s much more like a fire alarm sounding off in a building whose occupants have been locked in.The WSJ is of course far from the only media outlet guilty of peddling fossil fuel industry propaganda. Last Friday, The Hill published a very similar editorial by Fred Singer, whose second sentence included two very easily fact-checked falsehoods: “sea level has been rising at a steady rate, between 1 and 2 millimeters per year.” In reality, sea level rise has been accelerating, now up to about 3.3 millimeters per year.Some people are of the opinion that the Earth is flat, but the WSJ and The Hill probably wouldn’t publish Flat Earthers’ editorials. Of course, the Flat Earth Society doesn’t have the financial and political clout of the fossil fuel industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea0a5308e61d385d641aa80ef7cc14556d08f1/137_578_9404_5645/master/9404.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66caa5f307d17aa6adb2f34d5952888d","title":"world cup 2018 how to get the most from the guardian","story":"All you need to know about the ’s interactives, live coverage star columnists and much moreThree world-class players have joined the  and Observer for World Cup coverage which is more live, interactive and international than ever before.Here are a few pointers about how to find the best content online and in print from the sports website and sports newspaper of the year.

No sign of any thumbs, but here are some footballers pretending to be in Reservoir Dogs:While you’re on your lunch break, or whatever excuse to stop working for a bit is nearest in your part of the world, you could play with our all-time best-ever teamometers!There are many more to be found here!“If Brazil are arriving in Russia today, get your photographers ready,” writes Steve Wingrove. “Here in Brazil the thumbs up is pretty much an all encompassing verb ranging from ‘everything’s fine’ to ‘how are you?’ to ‘I’ll take the cheque please’ to ‘we’re a cert to lift the trophy this year as long as Neymar doesn’t get injured in the quarters again’, with masses more in between. This is all finely accompanied by various subtle movements of the eyebrows, forehead wrinkles and mouth. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if Brazil had a thumbs-up interpreter travelling with the squad. Anyway, getting to the point, I’m sure your ‘Footballers-at-airports-giving the thums-up’ series will receive a massive boost when the Seleção touches down!”They have already touched down (see Neymar’s thumbs-sideways, below). Here, though, is a picture of an entire squad’s worth of fully numbered sun loungers at their training base, the Yug Sport Stadium.The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has suggested that the England team should wear black armbands during the World Cup in protest at the policies of the Vladimir Putin regime. This, it strikes me, is unlikely. Here’s what he told the Press Association:The World Cup is a massive propaganda coup for the Kremlin and it should never have gone there in the first place. We are using the beautiful game to launder the reputation of a dangerous authoritarian regime and that poses some major questions. We should think creatively about what we might be able to do to send a message. The FA pulling out would have been wrong because it would have made it look like a bilateral issue between Russia and the UK. But there are universal human rights norms, universal ways in which countries behave towards each other and Russia is in violation of those norms. Maybe we should seriously consider wearing a black armband in our first match, or in all our matches, to mark the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter on British territory and the vicious injury to a member of our police force.It would need to be supported by the FA and they would probably be sanctioned by Fifa, who don’t like any symbolism, but at some point we’ve got to make a decision about the role and responsibility of football in the world. I suspect every single member of the English football team has more Twitter followers than any politician we have so they can send a really big political signal. They are role models to our young people and I do think this is an issue of our morals, our values and our ethics. It would great if they were able to say ‘We’re here in Russia now, but what’s happened on the streets of the United Kingdom raises concerns for all of us. An attack on one is an attack on all.’And here it is! The latest instalment in our occasional series Footballers in Airports Giving Thumbs-up Signs, starring Nemanja Matic.Serbia have landed!

This is copy-and-pasted from their press release:Fàbregas formed part of the irrepressible Spain team that won the Euros in 2008 and 2012, and is the perfect addition to a stellar line-up of international experts. With 355 caps and 120 goals scored in major tournaments between them, Cesc joins the previously announced World Cup winner Jurgen Klinsmann, twice African player of the year Didier Drogba and 2014 World Cup finalist Pablo Zabaleta.Philip Bernie, Head of TV Sport said: “We are delighted to welcome Cesc, as he joins our star-studded team of experts in Russia. As a World Cup winner, he knows what it takes to lift the biggest prize in the sport, and we are greatly looking forward to the world class football knowledge and insight he will add to our coverage.”Time, then, for the second instalment of the official, I-didn’t-make-this-up Zabivaka story!ZABIVAKA™ practices his skills everyday with his big brother - what he lacks in skill he makes up for in enthusiasm - and best friend from school. Sometimes, when they’re not busy with their other interests, ZABIVAKA™’s brothers and sisters join him for a 5-a-side match. None of them can keep up with him but they all love playing with him and supporting him. It was ZABIVAKA™’s science mad sister who designed his special glasses that help him target the goal with pin-point accuracy. ZABIVAKA™ has relatives in other parts of Russia, and in the summer he travels with the pack to visit his cousins in the Caucasus. The Ukrainian artist Andriy Yermolenko has created some rather eye-catching alternative posters for this World Cup. I’m not sure any of them are likely to get the thumbs-up from Moscow, but you can still see them here.This, from Sid Lowe, is excellent:On the day Amílcar Henríquez was killed he had been playing dominoes in Nuevo Colón, Panama. The assassins waited, using the house opposite his as a base where they planned to gun him down. Witnesses heard 23 shots and police found the stolen red Nissan Versa they drove, an AK47 assault rifle, a 9mm revolver and more than a hundred rounds of ammunition. Henríquez, hit a dozen times, was rushed to hospital, where he died. A second man, Delano Wilson, was also killed. Josimar Gómez was wounded. It was 15 April 2017.Henríquez was 33, a father of three small children, and his only fear, he had said, was leaving them. He was also a professional footballer for Árabe Unido and the national team, which he represented 85 times. His penalty gave Panama the only title in their history – the 2009 Copa Naciones – and in his last interview, three weeks earlier, he expressed his hopes of reaching a first World Cup.Read more here:Here’s a good read from last week that you might have missed, about the only man to play in two World Cup finals for two different countries.Here’s the Croatia team, boarding a plane earlier today.

It is, I think, absolutely terrifying.“Serbia are also on their way,” writes DM on Twitter. “For once it seems like a pretty happy camp!”In fact, Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Mexico, Nigeria, Serbia, Switzerland and Tunisia were all due to arrive in Russia today. Costa Rica, Germany, England, South Korea, Senegal and Sweden will follow tomorrow, with Belgium, Japan and Poland dragging their heels and not expected to turn up until the 13th. Iran were the keenest team, arriving nearly a week ago on 5 June.Conor Clark emails about Shaqiri. “Well,” he writes, “he needs the leg room.”Newsflash! Switzerland’s team is on their way to Russia.

It appears that nobody wants to sit next to Xherdan Shaqiri.Just browsing through Fifa’s ticketing website, and it looks like there’s not a lot left. Most matches have no availability at all, and the only ones which have tickets in all three categories are Japan v Poland and Panama v Tunisia, both on 28 June. Perhaps there’s something good on telly that day?Panama v Tunisia was always going to be a tough sell, mind. It’s being played at the Mordovia Arena in Saransk, which has an official capacity of 44,442. This is always going to annoy me. Couldn’t they have squeezed just two more seats in?The first in our occasional series, “footballers in airports giving thumbs up signs”. This is Neymar, whose Brazil team landed in Sochi overnight. It is more of a thumbs sideways than a thumbs up, though that might be an accident.Here’s an article about Gareth Southgate, as remembered by a couple of old Crystal Palace team-mates:We all know he’s a ‘nice guy’ but people seem to think that means he’s soft, which is nonsense. He’s not afraid to make difficult decisions. We saw a toughness in him. He was that close to getting the boot at Palace, right on the cusp when it came to turning pro. He had to fight to get where he is now. The reason they kept him on was he was so dedicated, so professional and always thinking. Want a comprehensive guide? Of course you do. How will Americans be watching this World Cup?Introducing our new World Cup columnist, Marcel Desailly. The following is taken verbatim from Version 6 (the latest iteration) of the official Zabivaka background story. I wasn’t aware that we needed to know how many siblings mascots have. I thought they were just supposed to look cute, to excite children and to sell merchandise. It seems I was wrong. Anyway, here goes!ZABIVAKA™ is the youngest in a big family of Siberian grey wolves. He lives with his 4 brothers, 5 sisters, mum, dad, aunts, uncles and cousins. All together there are 19 wolves in his pack. His dad is the leader of the pack and the reason why ZABIVAKA™ is so crazy about football. He used to play when he was a youngster, but hung up his boots many years ago now he’s just a huge fan of the local team, along with his own brothers and sisters and ZABIVAKA of course. It’s safe to say this is one football crazy wolf pack.

It is nearly 1,400 words long. Here his the once-humble wolf, hanging out with Cafu.This morning we’ve been given further information on Thursday’s opening ceremony. Here’s what the Press Association is telling us:Robbie Williams and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina will entertain the crowd at the opening ceremony of the World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium.They will be joined by Brazil’s two-time World Cup winner Ronaldo at Thursday’s show, which will be held just 30 minutes before the kick-off to the first match between Russia and Saudi Arabia. “I’m so happy and excited to be going back to Russia for such a unique performance,” Williams said. “I’ve done a lot in my career, and opening the FIFA World Cup to 80,000 football fans in the stadium and many millions all over the world is a boyhood dream.” The underlying theme of celebrating not only football but also the host country will be represented by a performance from Garifullina. “I never imagined I would be part of this huge celebration, the World Cup, happening in my own country,” the soloist from the Vienna State Opera said. “The image that I will be presenting to the whole world will be very symbolic and associated with a dream coming to life. “And, on 15 July, we will find out for whom this precious dream will come true, back on the same stage, after a month-long festival of football in Russia.” Ronaldo was part of the triumphant Brazil squad at the 1994 World Cup, albeit he did not feature, and then claimed the Golden Boot with eight goals as he led his nation to the trophy eight years later. The 41-year-old looks back fondly on past World Cup curtain-raisers and is relishing being involved at Russia 2018. “The opening match is always a very symbolic one - it is that instant when you realise that the big moment you, as a player or fan, have been waiting for for four years has finally arrived,” he said. “Of course it is also an emotional one for the hosts. After so much hard work, suddenly the whole world is gathered in your backyard to celebrate their love for football. “I felt that in Brazil four years ago and I am now happy to share this excitement with the Russians as well.” Here, as promised, is Grödig’s coat of arms. It appears to be a monkey vomiting blue lasers out of its mouth. So here we are. World Cup week. Things are really cranking into gear in Russia, and there will be (or have been already) press conferences from Spain, Russia, Portugal, Iceland, Australia, Panama, France, Croatia and Iran, as well as a variety of open-to-the-public training sessions and friendlies this evening between Belgium and Costa Rica, and Senegal and South Korea, the latter in the 4,128-capacity Untersberg-Arena in Grödig, Austria. I’m going to show you Grodig’s coat of arms in a minute, because it does look extraordinary. But in the meantime, hello!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9afe8f33ddb8b4a9a3134c61e6786f79d4e21528/456_0_1899_1140/master/1899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5c18608173a9d5f8a33cc7477baad7","title":"the alternative world cup","story":"Jet-lagged and a little bewildered by their urban surroundings, they lace their boots and run through a brief warm-up while a portable speaker plays a selection of songs from their homeland, Tuvalu, in the South Pacific. They have come to England to win the world cup – the Conifa World Football Cup, that is.Established in 2013 for states, de facto states, self-declared regions, ethnic minorities and sportingly isolated territories, Conifa brings together teams such as Tuvalu, Tibet, Padania, Matabeleland, Abkhazia and even the Isle of Man. They each have different backstories but what unites them is that none are yet recognised by Fifa, football\u0027s global governing body.Back home, Tuvalu train on a low-lying grass field which is often flooded by king tides and rising sea levels. “We keep on playing if the pitch gets flooded, or we use the airport runway,” says captain Taufaiva Ionatana. At the World Football Cup they must also adapt to artificial pitches, the like of which many have never seen before.Their opening match ends in a 4-0 defeat to Székely Land and they have only one day off before facing Padania, semi-finalists in 2016, to whom they lose 8-0. Eventually they find time to visit the sights of London but only with an escort – our photographer – to help them navigate the underground.Conifa has 47 member teams worldwide, 16 of which qualified for this year’s tournament, its third edition. By contrast, Fifa has 211 member nations with 32 competing at the upcoming World Cup in Russia. The two organisations have no formal affiliation though Fifa has offered its best wishes to Conifa.An Yong-hak is player-manager of the United Koreans in Japan. Having starred for North Korea at the 2010 World Cup, he says he is proud that he can now represent his ethnic roots as a descendant of those who fled the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century. Eight years ago he lined up against five-times World Cup winners Brazil in South Africa, now he’s playing against amateurs at tiny non-league venues on the fringes of London such as Colston Avenue in Carshalton and Arbour Park in Slough.“In Fifa’s world cup I was representing the North Korean nation here it is my identity as a Zainichi Korean,” he says. Of course, Fifa is a different scale and the football standard is very different but here the players are just as passionate.Despite the obvious political implications of staging such a tournament – the participation of Northern Cyprus drew letters of protest to Enfield council from Greek Cypriots in the community and some Kabylia players declined to participate because of fear of oppression from the Algerian government – Conifa maintains it is “politically neutral”.Per-Anders Blind, co-founder and president, says it seeks instead to promote inclusivity. “This is so natural for us,” he says. “We never talk politics at all, we don\u0027t care about it, genuinely. Today politicians only try to build up borders and separate people from one another. I see Conifa as a counter movement.”As an Indigenous person himself, part of the Sami people of northern Scandinavia, Blind grew up in an environment “where everybody had to fight for the right to exist”. But through football he says: “We can show that we are one human race and we can collaborate and coexist and show respect and be friends no matter where we come from.”For the players of Matabeleland, a vast region covering south-west Zimbabwe, participating at the World Football Cup would not have been possible without crowd-funding. Almost £4,000 was raised through GoFundMe alone.This journey started as a dream, says captain Praise Ndlovu. No one ever believed we would make it to London but we made it. I\u0027d like to say thank you to everyone. We have discovered there are a lot of people who love us out there.Everyone\u0027s in love with Matabeleland. It\u0027s mad, it\u0027s amazing, says Matabeleland’s British coach, Justin Walley. None of these boys have ever been outside of Africa. I said just come over and enjoy it, you\u0027re in the shop window. Life is short, come here and say: ‘I played in a world cup in England’.Non-league football fans Alan Ostler and Mark Chitty both contributed to the fundraising effort and have come to Coles Park in Haringey to see the team play. “We were just curious from hearing about their story and their struggles and the fact that Bruce Grobbelaar, a Liverpool legend (and former Zimbabwe international goalkeeper), is involved with them,” says Chitty. “You\u0027d like to think that maybe being here might change their lives.”Striker Shylock Ndlovu is optimistic. I think there will be some scouts who are watching us,” he says. “You never know, you could see us playing for some big teams in future. Division three, four, or even the Premier League.Xolani Koba Wakamasenga, a supporter, is more worried about how the players will afford to feed themselves after the match.

While Matabeleland’s fans exhibited their rich African culture with men dressed in animal hide dancing to the tune of traditional harmonies, Székely Land’s launched into raucous renditions of familiar football chants, spurred on by megaphones, drums and flares.The songs of the Matabeleland supporters are so intoxicating even neutrals sing along. “\u0027Yamma yamma\u0027 is like \u0027hooray hooray\u0027,” says Nokuthula Mpofu.

It has developed a green card system to punish players for persistent dissent and ing.German referee René Jacobi explains: “I like it that we have the opportunities to change some things because there are a lot of rules that make no sense at all. The problem with the yellow card is that nothing directly happens so there’s no problem for the player for dissent or when he’s ing in the box to get a penalty. There’s no risk.”“Fifa is too big and too slow,” he adds. “But we can change rules and look if it’s working and if it’s better for the game.”The scale of ambition shown by Conifa’s members varies: some are happy to have international opponents at last, some hope Fifa will one day recognise them, others plan to take on the world.Panjab’s president, Harpreet Singh, is as spirited as anyone. “I want to wake up a sleeping nation which has been abandoned and marginalised, he says. I want to revolutionise sport in Panjab and for all Punjabis across the world, for Panjab to become a super power in south Asia and then become number one in the world.“You know the way we perceive Brazilians to be: we think wow, dynamite, right? They\u0027re silky, they\u0027re great. I want Panjab to be spoken of in that context. We will do it. We will do it. Because I\u0027m willing to die for it.”In their final group match, Tuvalu face Matabeleland, the latter earning a 3-1 win. Both sides fail to qualify for the top-eight knockout phase. Meanwhile, Panjab lose 2-0 to Padania in a quarter-final match. The final in Enfield on 9 June will see either Northern Cyprus or Karpatalya crowned Conifa world champions.For Tuvalu, the sentiments of Tinilau seem pertinent even in defeat: “It’s an honour to represent Tuvalu, he had said a week earlier. We want to give it our all for Tuvalu and for the game of football – the beautiful game. They may be heading home dejected and recognition from Fifa may feel more distant than ever, but their sense of pride and purpose endures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43b8994efd66c4215e041b7e0562e96b28cf762/0_933_7994_4797/master/7994.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99af6447740b5f8723388730c1fa748","title":"rachel roddy recipe chickpea spinach braise","story":"Tender, giving chickpeas are the aim here – whether or not you soak them firstEvery Wednesday morning, behind the counter of their stall on Testaccio market, Enzo and Lina tip 10kg of dried chickpeas into a tub and cover them with cold water. The tub sits there for just shy of two days – 46 hours later – until Friday morning, when they drain the chickpeas, now butter-yellow and fat, and toss just a little bicarbonate of soda through them. To finish, they funnel 500g portions into small, clear plastic bags, which are knotted and piled on the counter near the soaked salt cod, ready for customers who still observe, or simply like, the Roman habit of eating a meatless, chickpea-centred meal on Fridays.“Two days? That is bonkers,” said a friend when I told her I had discovered the secret of plump chickpeas on the far-side of Testaccio market. “Forget soaking: cover them with boiling water for an hour, drain, cover with cold water, bring to the boil and simmer them for two” was her surefire method. Another friend suggested a four-hour soak and a pressure cooker was the way to go, while my neighbour swore by an eight-hour soak followed by a three-hour simmer, with or without bicarbonate. Trusted books are equally opinionated and disparate, an arc of suggestions from no soaking needed, to a times table of chickpea timings, 2, 4, 8, 48, some categorical that you must change the soaking water before simmering (it is toxic) and others very clear that you mustn’t (it is nectar).Of course, the answer to all this is to stop asking for advice and to figure out a method of my own. And for years I did have one. It may not have been surefire, but it was pretty sure: an overnight soak and then a juddering simmer until done. Then I cooked a few not-so-happy batches, as did a few readers – more than any other ingredient, I have had emails and notes about the curse of the still-hard chickpea. So I decided I would do a Felicity Cloake and test all the various ways, to come up with the perfect one. The thing is, this many possible combinations to test meant cooking more chickpeas than even we could eat, and my experiment quickly unravelled. My default position is to trust in Lina, with a degree of variation: a 24-48 hour soak, a light bicarbonate rub-through and simmering until the chickpeas are soft enough to squish into an almost-hummus between your fingertips (which isn’t very long if you have soaked Lina style).Soaking and cooking gives you that cloudy, slightly viscous cooking liquid, which provides a gently flavoured broth for soups, stews, or today’s dish of chickpeas and spinach, an Armenian dish called nivik from Tess Mallos’s 1979 Complete Middle Eastern Cookbook (in which, by the way, she suggests an overnight soak followed by a two-hour simmer in the soaking water). I knew this recipe would be a favourite the moment I read it (helped, no doubt, by Reg Morrison’s wonderful Technicolor photo). Tess suggests eating this with bread and pickles, and I do, although it is just as good with rice or a grilled lamb chop.Tender chickpeas are crucial for this dish: they need to succumb willingly to the back of a fork, not ping across the room, so I’d suggest cooking them according to Lina’s method (make a double batch). If you’d rather stick to your own method, please leave commentsadvice: I agree with Laurie Colwin in believing that, next to eating and cooking, talking and writing about eating and cooking are two of life’s delights. One home cook giving another advice really does make the cooking world go round.300g dried chickpeas1 pinch bicarbonate of soda750g spinach1 large onion, peeled and diced8 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp tomato paste or 100ml passataSalt and black pepperSugar, to tasteCover the chickpeas with cold water and leave to sit for 24-48 hours (which is why it is worth soaking a double quantity and keeping half for another dish).

The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60649188c46d5176509ab37341c24a75767f9757/0_199_1774_1064/master/1774.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9403fe1d24b4f8b91aba7a986ed06ee6","title":"name family house stamp duty","story":"I want to give our home to my wife and go and buy a property in Wales where she might join meQ My wife and I have a different outlook on the future. I wish to go and live in Wales and buy a home for myself to live in. I am happy to give our home to my wife (in the hope that she would see sense and join me). I understand that the government may see me as having an ulterior motive, but this is not the case. I want no money from any future sale. We own the house outright.Can I have my name removed from the family home and not be liable for any taxes or stamp duties? If you could advise me I would be grateful. RGA The process for putting your home in your wife’s name only is relatively straightforward as you own the home outright. The first step is to get an official copy of the title from the Land Registry then fill in and sign Land Registry forms TR1 and AP1. If you decide to do all this yourself, rather than instruct a solicitor to do it for you, you’ll also need to complete form ID1 but, strangely, this has to be done by a solicitor. If there was a mortgage on the property, you cannot start the transfer process without your lender’s written permission.However, although the transfer process is relatively simple, there is no point going through with it. If, as I suspect, you think that making your wife sole owner of your current home means that you won’t have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) on your Welsh home, you’ve got another thing coming. For the purposes of property ownership, married couples (and civil partners) are treated as one unit. That means that if one spouse (or partner) already owns property, the purchase of another property by either of them is seen as being the purchase of an additional property for both of them and so the higher rates of SDLT apply.Transferring your current home to your wife’s sole name would make sense if your move to Wales will mean permanent separation from her. That’s because married couples (and civil partners) living separately in circumstances that are likely to be permanent, are treated as iniduals rather than as one unit. Living separately while you wait for your wife to come round to your preferred location doesn’t count.On a cheerier note, giving your share of your current home to your wife (which is essentially what you would be doing by putting it in her name only for no money) would not bring about a capital gains tax (CGT) bill. Disposals of assets between spouse or civil partners are CGT-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d79b3fc3b729b0a81936e0e91ba209b98ed542/0_63_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7060085e27f89600afeb985f6ee6286f","title":"johnny marr webchat post your questions now","story":"The former Smiths guitarist, who has also played with everyone from Bryan Ferry to Girls Aloud, will answer your questions from 12.30pm BST on Thursday 14 JuneThe word “jangling” is now commonly used to describe a certain kind of indie guitar band, but it would never have come about without Johnny Marr.

Fair Vote has asked a judge to permanently bar the firms from destroying any data that they might be holding in Mississippi. At the heart of the complaint is an allegation that the companies may have used data that had been mined in the UK and combined it with information that had been collected from Eldon Insurance, which sells car insurance in the UK. The suit further alleges that the data may have been brought to the University of Mississippi, where the companies sought to create their own version of Cambridge Analytica, the controversial firm that used data mined from social media networks to try to sway voters’ behaviour. Fair Vote and the lead plaintiff in the case, a British resident called Kyle Taylor, have said in court filings that they want to determine whether any UK data was illegally transferred to Mississippi as part of the groups’ plans.It is also seeking answers about whether data was illegally used to target political advertising to UK voters before the referendum to leave the EU on 23 June 2016.The case was filed after evidence heard before a parliamentary committee raised questions about Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins’involvement with the University of Mississippi. She added: “This company has reportedly worked with a data science team at the University of Mississippi. If the Mississippi team has held or processed UK citizens’ data in the US, I believe that is likely to be a criminal offence although it is for the empowered authorities to pursue any such question and secure the associated evidence.”The allegations have been denied by Banks, who said that his first contact with officials at the University of Mississippi occurred months after the Brexit vote.“We are slightly bemused,” Banks told the . “I think where it has come from was what Brittany Kaiser said before the committee, but actually she was just talking rubbish.” He later added that he believed Kaiser was “just speculating” about his companies’ activities in Mississippi.“The only thing we have is an empty office that was due to be refurbished. We have no staff there,” Banks said. He added that his company Eldon Insurance had “strong data controls” and that it was “just not true” that data had been used in connection to the 2016 referendum.Banks’s companies have asked for the complaint to be dismissed.Josh Gladden, the University of Mississippi’s vice-chancellor for research, testified that Big Data Dolphins has no access to university computer servers and had not stored anything at the university.He said university researchers never agreed specific projects with Eldon and had not been asked to destroy evidence. “The result of this investigation is, to our satisfaction, that there’s been no data transfer between any of the companies and the University of Mississippi,” Gladden said.Victoria Sena, who manages the Big Data Dolphins project, testified that she never discussed server access. “I haven’t transferred data,” Sena said. “I don’t have access to data. There is no way to access it. There is no one to transfer it to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f322318e043c789b3e2bdf4a326e496957a2fe59/0_122_3904_2342/master/3904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd83054246d8abc7a87203a33ddb37d","title":"catastrophic no deal brexit a real possibility says vince cable","story":"Lib Dem leader urges Theresa May to stand up to hardline Brexiters in her own party A “potentially catastrophic” no-deal Brexit is becoming ever more possible, Vince Cable has warned, saying that if this happened it would be an unprecedented policy disaster.As the Liberal Democrats prepare to fight the Lewisham East byelection on Thursday on a platform of guaranteeing a referendum on any eventual deal, the party leader said the longer the government appeared deadlocked over Brexit, the greater the risk the UK would leave the EU without a deal.“I’d always assumed that the government would more or less get something, a orce settlement plus a vague commitment to sort things out – Brexit in name but probably not in fact,” Cable told the  during a visit to the constituency.“But as time passes and they can’t reconcile their internal differences, you begin to think that not getting any kind of deal at all is back on the agenda.

The chances of them actually dislodging her are not high,” he said. “You’d have thought she’d say, we’ve reached the limit of what we can do, and I’m going to go ahead in the customs unionsingle market framework, and you guys will have to put up with it. And she would have the support of the rest of parliament and would carry the country.”Cable has had mixed success as the Lib Dem leader since regaining his Twickenham seat at the 2017 election, but the party was buoyed by better-than-anticipated results in May’s local elections. It is hoping for another boost from the Lewisham East vote, which was prompted by Heidi Alexander’s decision to resign from the safe Labour seat for a role with London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.“We’re looking for a substantial improvement in our vote share – we’d certainly expect to overtake the Tories,” he said, sitting alongside the party’s candidate, the charity consultant Lucy Salek, in a cafe in the south-east London constituency.“There is a very, very outside possibility of winning, but given the size of the margin it will be difficult to do that.”Salek argued that with Labour complacent and the Conservatives largely absent there was scope for the Lib Dems to profit from concerns about Brexit in the heavily pro-remain constituency, where the issue has been mentioned “over and over again” on doorsteps.Cable said the party’s policy of calling for a public vote on a final Brexit deal was proving popular.“Brexit wasn’t very clearly defined at the time, in what it entailed,” he said. “That’s all the more reason for having a vote on the outcome, and that’s beginning to have a certain amount of resonance with voters.”One notable element of the byelection is the decision of the Labour candidate, Janet Daby, to support continued UK membership of the single market and customs union, contrary to party policy.While the Lib Dems question whether Daby has reined in her stance on Brexit under pressure from her party hierarchy, Cable said Labour isions before key votes on the EU withdrawal bill this week pointed to tensions reminiscent of the era when the Social Democratic party split away from Labour.Asked whether another centrist party could emerge, he said: “It could happen. Obviously, the SDP history, at least as it’s retold, is given as a warning about not repeating history. But I think some Labour MPs are being put in an impossible situation. We’ll see that when the votes come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4fbffd30d7441508ad275648da013dce61752a0/0_34_2659_1596/master/2659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e044fef1d4b96968b64b64fffdd1f498","title":"brexit jacob rees mogg hosts lbc phone in politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThere is an urgent question in the Commons on Yemen at 3.30pm.Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson has an intriguing hunch about why the government was originally so keen to push the EU withdrawal bill through the Commons in a single day (a backlash later forced it to offer two). Could it have been clearing the decks for a critical report from the Electoral Commission about the role of some of Theresa May’s senior aides in the Vote Leave campaign?Evidence from whistleblowers Chris Wylie and Sahmir Sanni appeared to suggest coordination between Vote Leave, the officially designated Brexit campaign, and the nominally separate BeLeave group. If the commission finds that Vote Leave was effectively directing the group of young Brexit campaigners, it could be a breach of election funding rules. The commission is believed to be examining the roles of May’s political secretary Stephen Parkinson, and Cleo Watson, another Number 10 adviser, both of whom held senior posts in Vote Leave - which was chaired by Michael Gove.Those involved in Vote Leave have always strongly denied wrongdoing, insisting that Vote Leave and BeLeave were separate and that they acted in accordance with the rules.The government has now confirmed to Labour MP Bridget Phillipson in a parliamentary question that those criticised in its ongoing investigation have been given 28 days’ warning of its findings. Rumours at Westminster suggest the report could be scheduled for publication on Wednesday - though the commission has not yet confirmed a date.Each day the plot thickens about the murky dealings of the various Brexit campaigns. Now it seems senior figures at the heart of Number 10 who were involved in Vote Leave could have been informed about the contents of this important Electoral Commission investigation long before anyone else. If that’s true, Number 10 would have had time to plan and even ensure key Brexit votes like the ones this week could happen before the investigation findings are published. You’ve got to question whether that’s appropriate and whether those people under investigation should really still be shaping and taking decisions at the heart of government.And here are more lines from Theresa May’s article about Grenfell Tower in the Evening Standard.It has taken too long, but of the 203 households in need of a new home, 198 households have now accepted an offer of accommodation, either permanent or temporary.Given the scale of the tragedy, the public inquiry and police investigation will, inevitably, take time — longer than many of us would like. But while I will not tolerate unnecessary foot-dragging, they must be given the space they need to do their jobs properly. Only that way can any iniduals and organisations found to be at fault be properly held to account for their actions. Only that way can justice be done.A crucial part of the recovery process concerns the future of the tower and the site on which it sits. No decisions have yet been taken on this but I can again repeat my personal commitment that the bereaved, the survivors and the community will lead the process.More than £46m has been spent on the immediate response and recovery effort, with a further £34m earmarked for the longer-term recovery that’s in addition to the almost £25m donated by the public, nearly all of which has already been distributed to survivors and the bereaved.The group Grenfell United has come together to provide a voice for the survivors and they have done so with great dignity and determination. To honour that spirit they have invited communities and schools across the country to come together in a celebration of unity and ersity, turning next Friday into a national “Green for Grenfell Day”. Head teachers are being encouraged to let children wear green to school and community groups will be out in force, helping others and fundraising for local charities.And, as night falls on Thursday, buildings across the country, including 10 Downing Street, will be illuminated in green — a very visible tribute to everyone affected by the fire.As part of Green for Grenfell, children from primary schools around the tower will visit No 10 tomorrow to plant two camellia bushes in the garden here.Camellias flower in the winter months, bringing life and colour to the darkest times of the year. Growing within sight of the cabinet room, they will provide a lasting reminder of those we lost on that darkest of nights.Last year, a week after the Grenfell Tower fire, Theresa May apologised for the way national and local government responded to the tragedy. One of the many things that angered survivors was the fact that May did not meet them on her first visit to the site of the fire.Today, in an article for the Evening Standard, May has gone much further in admitting that her own response was flawed. She says she will “always” regret giving the impression she did not care.Here is an extract from the article.It was a tragedy unparalleled in recent history and, although many people did incredible work during and after the fire, it has long been clear that the initial response was not good enough. I include myself in that.The day after the disaster I made the first of a number of trips to the site, thanking the firefighters for their work and holding a short meeting with the team in charge of the response. What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze.But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair. And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care. That was never the case.And here is how the Standard are splashing on the story.I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. The main line was Number 10 saying Theresa May expects President Trump to stand by the G7 communique which he agreed - before he subsequently disowned it after he lost his temper with the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.Asked if May was disappointed by Trump’s comments after he left Canada, the prime minister’s spokesman said:The communique was agreed by all the parties who attended the G7. We fully intend to honour it. We would hope that the US would similarly honour the commitments that they’ve made.Here is the programme motion for the EU withdrawal bill debates on Tuesday and Wednesday.I’m just off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30amThe ’s James Crisp has more on the DavisBarnier meeting. (See 9.43am.)Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP who was one of the 12 backbenchers who helped defeated the government on the EU withdrawal bill in December, told the Today programme this morning that she was “minded” to rebel on the “meaningful vote” amendment when it gets debated later this week.She also said that she and other Tory pro-Europeans wanted more concessions from the government on the customs union issue. She said:We would like to see further concessions on the amendment on the customs union because it is just a very sensible amendment that says keep it on the table, don’t completely rule it out.But this insisted that this was not about bringing down the prime minister. She said:If it came back to us then having to have a vote of confidence, we would all vote to support the prime minister. We do support the prime minister. The Jacob Rees-Mogg LBC phone-in didn’t really make news. What was most interesting was that, in the light of growing evidence of Brexiter despondency (see 9.03am), Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, was keen to urge his supporters to be “calm” and “patient”. Brexit was moving “slowly in the right direction”, he insisted.I think people should be calm. Inevitably in this negotiation and in this process people sometimes get frustrated, and the backstop deal is a problem. It depends what is in it, and it depends on the time limit. But what really matters is the withdrawal bill that is going through parliament this week and, very importantly, an article jointly authored by Amber Rudd and Iain Duncan Smith saying, basically, if you don’t vote for this you risk getting Jeremy Corbyn and there are further discussions to have on how we leave, but this is just bringing in the decision to leave. And there’s quite a degree of unity within the Conservative party at the moment. So I’m optimistic about what’s happening. I think it’s going slowly in the right direction, more slowly than I would like, but still still in the right direction ...The key to this is that we shouldn’t get over-exercised by negotiating documents when the other side hasn’t even responded, because you have a great row about something and then the EU says, ‘It doesn’t matter what that document says, we don’t like it.’ And we need to just be a little bit more patient as these negotiations go on.According to the ’s James Crisp, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has had his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. But Davis would not speak to the press afterwards, Crisp says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0b1b67a865464cd7cd4bf00ef876da719b25b6/0_87_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4cdaa288a0a5b57a83c351804308841","title":"when size does matter big beasts last of the giants in pictures","story":"Patrick Aryee’s gets up close and personal with some of the world’s biggest creatures in his new three-part series.

But the climate is changing. In recent weeks, the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican who opposes marijuana legalization, has called for hemp to be legalized, a move which would benefit farmers, though McConnell still opposes marijuana legalization. And it’s not just the farmers in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky who would be pleased to see a resurgence of the crop. Early this month for hemp history week, the US Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution acknowledging hemp’s economic value and “historical relevance”.China, though wary of marijuana, has emerged as a hemp “superpower”, according to a fascinating 2017 story in the South China Morning Post. While hemp is indigenous to China, Chinese research advanced only recently in 1970 when the military used it for uniforms that would be more comfortable in the Vietnamese jungle. Today, the Morning Post notes, China holds more than half of the world’s more than 600 hemp-related patents. Hemp’s revival is only the latest chapter in a long history.In China, hemp has been used to make fabric and rope for more than 3,000 years. A Chinese eunuch named Cai Lun, who is credited with inventing paper during the early Christian era, used hemp as one of his source materials. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, hemp rope, sails and rigging were so vital to the British Royal Navy that the supply was considered a national security issue. Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I encouraged growing the crop. In the US, some of the founding fathers grew hemp. Stoner lore has it that the constitution and declaration of independence were written on hemp. It’s not true – they were written on parchment – but drafts of the documents probably were. But interest in hemp waned as cotton, a finer fabric dependent on American slave labor, ascended. It was last a relevant crop in the US during the second world war, when the Department of Agriculture made a Hemp for Victory film and encouraged production. Today’s hemp advocates, a passionate cohort indeed, claim paper, cloth and biofuel made from hemp are all environmentally and economically attractive, relative to the prevailing current methods. If hemp became a major source for any one of these staples, it would be an immense opportunity, akin to legal marijuana.And there are more uses for hemp still. The seeds are a good source of protein, popular with vegans. Hemp can also be made into a building material known as hempcrete, which is currently easier to access in parts of Europe than in the US. A bridge in sixth-century Gaul was built from hempcrete. Bryan DeHaven’s Colorado-based clothing company, Chiefton Supply Co, makes T-shirts from a hempcotton blend. The component organic hemp is grown, processed into fabric and then stitched into apparel all at one facility in China’s Shangdong province.DeHaven said hemp’s benefits included that it needed substantially less water than cotton to grow. The resultant cloth, he said, also had anti-bacterial properties Chiefton is working with sportswear companies on breathable hemp clothing for athletes. “Those guys are really putting our garments to the test,” he said. Eventually, DeHaven said, he would like to see Chiefton hemp goods produced in the US “from seed to seam”. It will be difficult. Hemp is not completely illegal in the US but the current rules are wildly convoluted, probably even more so than those for marijuana. But the laws weren’t the main problem, DeHaven said. You can’t make hemp clothing in the US because the country no longer has sufficient expertise in textile production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e41da532eb8765b572b897541527c5ac1f09904/470_183_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705bdf0eafdbad5f3be1fc2b54e881da","title":"schalk brits called out of retirement and the stands for south africa squad","story":"• Retired Saracens forward watched first Test as fanSouth Africa have added Schalk Brits to their squad for the remainder of their Test series against England – a month after the veteran Saracens hooker retired. Brits, who was in South Africa on holiday and was at the first Test as a fan, retired after Saracens’ Premiership final victory over Exeter but has unexpectedly been called up by Springboks boss Rassie Erasmus. “Schalk has extensive inside knowledge and plenty of experience from playing for Saracens in the English and European conditions,” Erasmus said. “We are busy with building experience, continuity and capacity towards the Rugby World Cup, so we want out young players rubbing shoulders with experienced players.”England have summoned uncapped Worcester hooker Jack Singleton to join their tour of South Africa as injury cover for Luke Cowan-Dickie. Cowan-Dickie suffered a hamstring problem during Saturday’s 42-39 defeat at Ellis Park to place him in doubt for the second Test against the Springboks in Bloemfontein. The Exeter front row supplied back up to Jamie George in the series opener and if he is ruled out, Singleton will be promoted straight on to the bench. “Luke has a tight hamstring so Jack Singleton is coming as a precaution,” defence coach Paul Gustard said. “We’ve only got two hookers in camp so we have to be careful and have someone else coming over. Luke hasn’t been ruled out of Saturday yet.” England were unable to provide a definitive update on Joe Launchbury, who sat out the firsts Test because of a calf injury. Saracens pair Maro Itoje and Nick Isiekwe were the starting second rows in Johannesburg but the latter was the victim of a tactical substitution shortly before half-time to place his role in the remainder of the tour in doubt. Uncapped Jonny Hill is the only other specialist lock in the squad with Brad Shields an option in the position if Launchbury is ruled out once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8410570462ce5f64690446baa7f4be93a679707c/0_341_5147_3089/master/5147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbd14f0f79894f367f1db4ef3e9e488","title":"uk should not legislate to control childrens use of technology says culture secretary","story":"Matt Hancock refuses to rule out law to protect minors online, but would stop short of French measuresThe UK culture secretary, Matt Hancock, does not allow his own children to have mobile phones and thinks none should have access to devices overnight, but would not follow the French government’s lead in legislating on the issue.Hancock, whose brief includes digital issues, said: “Keeping children safe online is mission-critical, and everybody has a responsibility. The parents have a responsibility to ensure that children use technology appropriately. For instance, I allow my children to do their homework online, but I don’t let them on to social media.Asked how he polices his own children, Hancock told the : “They don’t have access to the devices. They don’t have phones. Why do they need phones? They’re children, they’re 11. “There’s a responsibility for parents, but there’s a responsibility for government too in ensuring that it’s as easy as possible for parents to do this properly, to keep their children safe. So for instance, making sure that internet companies properly police their own terms and conditions is important.”He dismissed suggestions, however, that the UK government should intervene more directly to control the exposure of children to new technology as France has done. A 2010 law bans phones in classrooms, and the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has pushed further. From September, children under 15 will not be able to use phones on school premises at all.Laws governing children\u0027s relationship with technology vary around the world, and are rarely enforced. The de facto age for many online services is 13, set by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998, which prevents sites from targeting children, or knowingly allowing children to provide information online without parental consent. The burden of garnering that consent and the low returns for building services for children has meant, however, that providers tended to turn a blind eye to under-13s on their site, neither catering for them nor expending the effort required to police against their presence.That said, tech aimed more explicitly at children has blossomed recently, and legislation that aims to protect children from potential harm have also been passed. Schoolchildren in France are barred by law from using their phones in the classroom and, from September this year, from using their phones in school at all.Such laws are countered by efforts on the part of companies such as Facebook and Google to attract new users while they’re young. Facebook offers Messenger Kids, which allows children to speak to contacts vetted by their parents, while Google’s YouTube has a Kids app that offers copious parental controls and the ability to filter videos for all but the most child-safe content – although the filters, which are run by an algorithm,\u0026nbsphaven’t always been successful, prompting the company to\u0026nbspannounce a human-curated version\u0026nbspin April.Hancock does not think laws are appropriate in these areas. “In some places laws are required. In other places, it’s just that as a society we have to mature to make the most out of this technology, which is amazing and brilliant, rather than use it badly.“So, for instance, I think it’s really hard to parent in the digital age. It’s one of the hardest times to be a parent because there’s this new technology that often the children understand better than the grownups. And there aren’t norms of how we use it.Hancock is more outspoken, however, about regulating the internet in other ways. He reiterated his plans to implement legislation that would force social media companies to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms, and said Britain might go it alone if it was unable to establish an international coalition to support regulation.“We don’t rule out legislation,” he said. “It is best if this approach is done internationally, but it doesn’t have to be. Because ultimately, we need political accountability over an area of life where there is a huge amount of power in the hands of a small amount of people.”Hancock was speaking ahead of the launch of London Tech Week, which promotes digital industry in the capital.The prospect of higher penalties has led some social networks to tighten up their practices. Twitter decided as a result of the new rules to delete the accounts of anyone who had joined the service as a child at the time when the company did not ask for a birthdate to sign up, even if they are now an adult.The government has offered little detail about what form its future social media legislation might take. Speaking to the BBC in May, Hancock said it may involve fines for companies that fail to act on bullying and harassment on their platforms, with a scale equivalent to that of the GDPR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a588749fee4149b1004f3bede5d8014f95ccb3b/0_45_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38017a9159fc8e726b272661326e761f","title":"gay asylum seeker faces deportation from uk to nigeria adeniyi raji","story":"Adeniyi Raji’s case just one of rising number from countries outlawing homosexualityA Nigerian asylum seeker who fled to Britain to avoid prosecution for being gay is facing deportation after being held for six months in an immigration detention centre.The threat hanging over Adeniyi Raji, 43, who received death threats on social media, highlights the increasing number of claims to the Home Office by iniduals from countries where homosexuality is outlawed. In Nigeria, homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also outlawed. After Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is the country that produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation.Raji fled the city of Lagos and arrived at Heathrow airport in November. He claimed asylum and was immediately detained, being held at Harmondsworth and Tinsley House detention centres. He was recently given bail and released from detention. Threats against him on on social media in Nigeria included comments such as: “I really wish you were killed that very day …”, “You know gay practice is an abomination in our land …”, and “You better stop your gay practice, if not you could get yourself killed in this country”. A first-tier immigration tribunal has rejected his asylum application. He is appealing against that decision. Bisi Alimi, a Nigerian-born British citizen who runs a UK-based campaign supporting LGBT rights in his home country, criticised the Home Office’s treatment of gay asylum seekers. “They are often treated as liars. It becomes their responsibility to prove that they are gay and that that will put their lives at risk,” he said.“In Nigeria, people put a tyre around your neck and burn you, and no one cares or beat you until you die, and no one cares. The Home Office doesn’t believe in the impact of threats from non-state actors. Raji’s solicitor, Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, an immigration specialist at the law firm Duncan Lewis, said: “The court has looked at his case and nullified all his evidence that he is at serious risk if removed to Nigeria but there’s been no evidence that his documents aren’t genuine.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its inidual merits.“We have worked closely with organisations and charities, including Stonewall, the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, and the UN high commissioner for refugees to improve our guidance and training for asylum caseworkers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute say a 16-year-old boy is helping them with their enquiriesOne challenger questions if some student voters at NUIG were properly registeredDavid Campbell McConnell charged with disorderly behaviour and resisting policeIndependent TD pleads not guilty to five charges of filing incorrect tax returnsPostmortem due on Mikolaj Wilk (35) as wife is treated in hospitalPeat extractors have committed to stop milling near the Mayne bog road, which is 6m in widthIrish Water says there are issues with water supply across DublinDead man, whose wife is being treated in hospital, has been named as Mikolaj Wilk (35)Couple subjected to a traumatic ordeal as attacker initially drove off with their childFoul play is ruled out as cause of death of 45-year-old found in apartment on Lee RoadPlan to reduce deaths includes \u0026lsquoknowledge transfer\u0026rsquo visits for groups of farmersHomeless families in Dublin willing to move county are missing out on propertiesMaria Bailey says there is a far more compelling case for a new station in CherrywoodHealth and safety inspection on Termonfeckin farm \u0026ndash from slurry tanks to roofsPrivate investigators were used to monitor inidual doctors\u0026rsquo hours, it has been reportedState conceded accused was legally insane at the time of road collision that killed teenagerDisability Federation of Ireland warns of human rights violations over PA shortageMinister says legislation raises complex issues in relation to identity and privacyData Protection Commissioner to begin investigation into such projects next month"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526584.1528718548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the exceptional weather is coming to an end met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            People play a game of cards at the beach on Bull Island on a sunny day near Dublin this weekend.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt has been as glorious a start to the summer as most of us can remember and the good weather is set to continue for the next few days at least.However, Met Éireann is warning the “exceptional weather” will come to an end later this week.Dublin recorded one of its sunniest weeks on record last week with some 80 hours of sunshine, the equivalent of more than 11 hours a day.Monday will be mild and dry in most places with a respectable 21 degrees in the midlands and east. This is cooler than of late and the sunshine will be more hazy, but still above normal for the time of year.Tuesday will be a similar kind of day and both days will be dry across the country.A notable change is due on Wednesday. The bad news is that rain is forecast across the country for the first time in weeks: the good news is that this will be most welcome by farmers and Irish Water.The rain will appear off the west coast on Wednesday afternoon and gradually extend across the country reaching eastern areas by nighttime.Near drought-like conditions have been experienced across the country for the past three weeks. Dublin has had just 1mm of rain since June 1st and May was exceptionally dry with just a third of the average rainfall recorded for the month.Most places had just trace amounts of rainfall in recent weeks. Even those places that had more normal levels of rainfall in the north and midlands only did so because of heavy thunderstorms last week.There has been several gorse fires over the last few weeks in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and the dry conditions have caused water shortages in the Skerries area of Dublin.The Department of Agriculture has issued an orange “high risk” forest fire warning that remains in place until Wednesday, June 13th.They have asked public if they see a fire to not delay in reporting a fire to the fire and emergency services.But rain is on the way.“The exceptional weather is coming to an end but we’re not going down the tubes either,” Met Éireann forecaster John Eagleton said.He explained the change in wind direction from south to west will mean a transition to cooler, more showery weather. Nevertheless, the temperatures will still be in the high teens and rainfall amounts will not be above normal.“We’re not going to get lashings of it,” he explained. “It won’t be as sunny as it was, but it will still be very pleasant.”Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry days with temperatures of 16 to 18 degrees - cooler because of the change in wind direction.Mr Eagleton said rainfall amounts over the next 10 days will range from 15mm in the east and midlands to 60mm in the north-west.Some rain is forecast next weekend as there will be more unsettled conditions and southwesterly winds.

Chesterton Society in his home country of Argentina.At a later stage of the canonisation process, the Vatican will look for evidence that he has performed posthumous miracles by answering prayers. The report\u0027s findings show that infertile couples, in particular, are said to have singled out Chesterton, himself childless, to ask for miracle conceptions, said Canon John Udris, who compiled the report.“Very interestingly, I have noticed people saying that they are praying for him,” he said.Chesterton was an eminent writer, and produced hundreds of stories, books, essays and plays.His works of Christian apologetics are highly regarded, and he was eventually knighted by Pope Pius XI before his death in 1936.Opponents of G.K. Chesterton’s canonisation point to alleged anti-Semitic views he expressed in his lifetime, including the presentation of Jews as greedy or cowardly in his literary works. Later in his life, Chesterton said that Jews should have to wear distinctive dress so that they could be identified, and opposed the defendant Alfred Dreyfus in a trial widely perceived to be an anti-Semitic miscarriage of justice.Canon Udris told The Daily  that while presenting the views of “people who have hesitations, reservations, and actually who are dead set against the cause” is crucial to his report, his personal view is that “wasn’t a racist bone in his body”. How to be a saintThe last English saints to be canonised were the so-called Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, who were executed for treason and related offences between 1535 and 1679. Although the the seventeeth-century martyrs were recognised by Pope Paul VI only in 1970, if Chesterton\u0027s clause is successful he would be the first English saint to have lived for more than 300 years.The process of canonisation must begin at least five years after a person’s death, except for in exceptional circumstances decided by the Pope, such as the canonisation of Mother Theresa. It usually takes at least fifty years, and the Vatican must find evidence that at least two miracles have been performed.Chesterton’s grave is in Beaconsfied, Buckinghamshire, and has become a landmark of local interest, although Canon Udris said that residents wouldn\u0027t have conceived of him in any sense as a candidate for a sainthood”, and that much of the pressure for his canonisation had come from abroad. Members of the Argentinian Chesterton society and supporters in the United States and Canada were the first to petition the Bishop of Northampton to begin the canonisation process in 2013.Vatican City and Holy SeeMatteo Salvini is confronting Europe\u0026#39s liberal centre with Trumpian hard truths about migrant boatsComment: Trump\u0026#39s threats to Kim Jong-un show that this is the real way to achieve nuclear disarmament Comment: Politicians denying the referendum decision is an acid that eats away at the heart of our democracyBodyguards, handshakes and high heels: How every detail matters when Trump meets Kim Jong-uniCarly and Modern Family actor Jackson Odell found dead, aged 20North Koreans finally told about Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s Singapore summit with Donald TrumpRobert De Niro uses F-bomb against Donald Trump on live TV during Tony AwardsBrexit donor Aaron Banks says he\u0026#39s a victim of a political witch huntStranded migrant rescue boat \u0026#39running out of provisions\u0026#39 as Italian populists locked in stand-off with MaltaWho is Ri Chun-hee, North Korea\u0026#39s melodramatic star newsreader who announced Kim\u0026#39s trip to SingaporePoldark, series 4 episode 1 review: that tongue-in-cheek entrance was well worth itEd Sheeran struck by curse of the great-crested newts as plans for private chapel on holdF-15 crashes into Sea off Japan in latest accident involving US forces in OkinawaRescue boat carrying 600 migrants stranded in Mediterranean in stand-off between Italy and MaltaComment: Love Island proves that the art of conversation is not dead yetRocket man: How Kim Jong-un emerged from his father\u0026#39s shadow to silence the doubtersWhen does summer start?

hunt great crested newts objections plan","story":"Ed Sheeran has been hit with the curse of the great-crested newt as his plans to build a private chapel on his estate have been put on hold.  The pop star has now been forced to commission experts to hunt for the protected amphibians around his land in East Anglia.The 27-year-old singer-songwriter, who announced his engagement to long-time girlfriend Cherry Seaborn in January, has submitted a planning application for the Saxon-style structure to Suffolk Coastal District Council.But a string of concerns have been raised, including from Suffolk Wildlife Trust which said there were records of great crested newts in the area in 2015 and it is possible that ponds within the site boundaries could be breeding sites for this species.Great crested newts, Britain\u0027s largest newt species, have declined over recent years and are now legally protected.An artist\u0026#39s impression of the chapel Ed Sheeran wants to buildIt is illegal to disturb the animals or obstruct access to areas where they live and breed, with the protected area extending up to 500m from their breeding ponds, the wildlife trust said.Paul Smith, of Apex Planning Consultants, said: The applicant has responded promptly to this matter and has also commissioned an appropriate survey that will identify the presence of great crested newts or otherwise, propose mitigation measures as appropriate and recommend measures to enhance bioersity.These could include bat boxes, swift nesting boxes and native planting, he said.We were not aware of the historical presence of great crested newts nearby and certainly believe that none exist in the pond nearby to the application site, he added.Mr Smith also addressed concerns from people who claim the planned chapel would be unsightly and could draw celebrity-spotters to the area.Ed Sheeran, who was launched a hunt for great-crested newts after objections to his plan for private chapelResponding to one objector who contends that the chapel will attract attention from the public and media, Mr Smith said it would be sited on private land approximately 230m from the road.Therefore we do not agree that at such distance from public land and views it will generate the attention he (the objector) purports, he wrote.Indeed, his argument somewhat demonstrates why the applicant requires a private chapel for private non-denominational contemplation.He said claims that the chapel would be a blot on the landscape, destroying views were not based on facts and discredit the high-quality architecture.Ed Sheeran: stories behind his tattoosHe added that it is common for Suffolk churches to be located on the edge of or outside settlements.Often, but not entirely because of the 14th century post-plague relocations of villages, this relationship is strongly characteristic of the area, he said.It is also the case that private chapels are generally sited away from their host houses for the purpose of providing a visible feature in the landscape encouraging the contemplation of the viewer.The proposed flint chapel would hold a congregation of around 24.The application states there is a need for the chapel as it is every person\u0027s right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth.A wedding licence would be needed if Sheeran planned to marry there.An expected decision date on the planning application is not available, the council\u0027s website said.Matteo Salvini is confronting Europe\u0026#39s liberal centre with Trumpian hard truths about migrant boatsComment: Trump\u0026#39s threats to Kim Jong-un show that this is the real way to

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.The Deputy Bank of England Governor Dave Ramsden said last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise. The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three monthly basis the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis of the weakness of the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying that it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK\u0027s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many cases, students were given warnings, fines or asked to apologise.In one case at Queen’s University Belfast, a student accused of Islamophobia was asked to write a 3,000 word reflective essay as punishment.Ilyas Nagdee, NUS black students’ officer, said that stories of perpetrators getting away with a “slap on the wrist” had meant many students were being put off from complaining about racism. “They don’t believe that they will actually see the justice they want to see,” he said.Of the universities contacted, around a third did not share the details of alleged racist incidents, with many citing the sensitive nature of the information. Meanwhile, some universities did not provide any information because they said they did not record incidents under the category of ‘racist’.Overall, there was not one consistent approach to recording the data – with some universities citing they only had access to formal complaints, rather than allegations raised through other outlets.James Kingett, from Show Racism the Red Card, said he was “concerned” by the rise and he added that it was “troubling” to hear of inconsistencies in terms of reporting across universities. \u0026nbspHe said: “Transparency of reporting is essential so that students and staff understand how incidents are defined, investigated and resolved.”The rise has come as hate crime incidents have increased across the country, showing that universities and education are not immune. “Incidents of racism are on the rise across the country and the developing body of evidence can no longer be ignored,” Mr Kingett said.Mr Nagdee added: “The first step has to be universities taking ownership and recognising the issue because until we do that, universities will continue to be perceived as liberal places of tolerance when unfortunately all the data, all the stories and all the evidence is telling us this is not the case.”On the figures obtained by The Independent, he added: “I am sure the total number of racist incidents is much much higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if the numbers are even higher in the future.”A recent social media campaign from the NUS saw more than 100 students come forward with stories of racism on campus across 30 universities in just one week – with some saying they were worried about their safety. “This is a daily reality for students across the country,” Mr Nagdee said.And students appear to be using social media more and more to report racist incidents, rather than through the formal university channels, in order to ensure action is taken as quickly as possible.\u0026nbspA student from Nottingham Trent pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment in court last month, after a student posted a video of him making racist chants outside her room on social media.And this year, Sheffield Hallam University began an investigation after a student tweeted that library staff had called him a monkey. It came after a banana was reportedly thrown at a black Sheffield Hallam graduate during an ice hockey game between his alma mater and the University of Sheffield.The University of Sheffield was forced to apologise for an “unacceptable delay” in the handling of the incident – which involved one of its students – and it said it would review its proceedings.Sheffield was one of the institutions that saw a rise in the number of racist incidents in two years, according to the new data, from three reports in 2015 to 11 in 2017.But many students have found it difficult to report racist incidents. Melinda Acquah, a third year at Sheffield University, has experienced racism – but she has not formally reported any incidents.One of her former housemates used the “n word” around her – which made her feel “uncomfortable” and singled out as the only BME student in the house. “I didn’t know how to report incidents like this to the university. I didn’t know how to deal with it,” she told The Independent.And it is not only students that face racism. A racist note was left on a staff member’s desk at the Royal Veterinary College in 2017 – but they failed to identify the perpetrator, the data shows.Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union (UCU), said: “A number of shocking incidents have made headlines recently and while universities obviously must not tolerate this kind of behaviour, they need to be more proactive in stopping it.“All universities must make it clear how staff and students can report any incidents and those that do make reports must be confident they will be properly supported.”Sam Gyimah, universities minister, said: “There is absolutely no place for any form of hatred, discrimination or racism in society. Universities have clear responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 in this regard. I expect institutions to act swiftly to investigate and address hate crime, including racist related incidents reported to them.”A Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said: “Universities UK’s Taskforce has published recommendations to universities on dealing with hate crime affecting university students.“A recent follow-up report recommended that each university should consider having one system to collect, record and store data on all types of hate crime at their institution.”She added: “Following this report and recent high profile cases, we are redoubling our efforts to identify the scale of race based hate crime in universities and how they prevent and respond to incidents. This project will establish what further action should be taken and continue to offer best practice guidance.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump\u0027Arron Banks, a major funder of the Brexit campaign, met with the Russian Ambassador to the UK three times in the run up to the EU referendum, it has emerged.The millionaire co-founder of Leave.EU also made repeated contact with Russian officials and flew out to Moscow to discuss business opportunities, according to reports.Mr Banks\u0026nbsphas previously said his “sole involvement with the Russians was a boozy six-hour lunch with the ambassador”, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.Leaked emails now suggest there were further links between the Leave.EU campaign and Russian officials, according to\u0026nbspThe Observer\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspThe Sunday Times.Mr Banks and Andy Wigmore, the director of communications for Leave.EU, are said to have had a further lunch with the Russian ambassador in November 2015 – three days after they visited US president Donald Trump in New York with Nigel Farage.The ambassador introduced them to a Russian businessman who reportedly offered Mr Banks an opportunity to buy Russian goldmines and make a potential profit of several billion dollars, it is claimed.Mr Banks then visited Moscow in February 2016 to meet investors in the gold project.It is not clear if he put money into the deal, which was announced 12 days after the referendum, but he later tweeted he was “buying gold at the moment”.There was further contact in the run-up to the US election, during which Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore campaigned in support of Donald Trump.On Friday\u0026nbspthe pair\u0026nbspannounced they were pulling out of a grilling by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspafter claiming they were being targeted in a “co-ordinated witch hunt” of Leave groups.Mr Banks later said\u0026nbspthey would appear before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s fake news inquiry on Tuesday as planned.Mr Banks admitted that he handed over telephone numbers for members of Mr Trump’s transition team to Russian officials, according to The Sunday Times.However he denied that Russian officials sought to influence his Leave.EU referendum campaign.“I had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him,” Mr Banks\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp”Bite me. It’s a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.

Ms Cadwalladr rejected the allegation.In a statement, the Russian embassy said: “The Russian Embassy has not in any way intervened in domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum.

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.The Deputy Bank of England Governor Dave Ramsden said last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise. The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three monthly basis the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis of the weakness of the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying that it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK\u0027s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In May\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsolar road\u0026nbspwas installed in a car park of a Seven-Eleven store in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture.The solar road\u0026nbspcomprises of a system of solar panels installed on the road, with the surface of the panels covered with a special resin to enhance durability. It is possible for vehicles\u0026nbspto drive over the panels. Solar roads have already been introduced on\u0026nbspmotorways in France and on\u0026nbspcycling roads in the Netherlands.A manager at the Seven-Eleven store said:\u0026nbspThe solar road\u0026nbspsystem can generate 16,145 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, covering about nine\u0026nbspper cent of the entire electricity that the store consumes.Tokyo\u0027s government has focused on the new technologies as potential renewable energy sources.It\u0026nbsphas set a goal of having renewable energy account for about 30 per cent of Tokyo\u0027s power consumption by 2030, compared to a similar target of\u0026nbspabout 12 per cent in 2016.The\u0026nbspgovernment said there are no restrictions in terms of locations for installing the \u0027solar road\u0027 system, which increases the possibilities for expanding renewable energy.The problem with introducing \u0027solar roads\u0027 is the high cost. As the technology is not widely used,\u0026nbspits components are not mass-produced. In France, it costs\u0026nbspabout €5m\u0026nbsp(£4.4m) to install one kilometre of solar road.Tokyo\u0027s government\u0026nbspplans to introduce solar roads on\u0026nbspgovernment-owned facilities such as car parks, where the amount of electricity generated\u0026nbspby installing the system would justify the cost.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspgovernment hopes that by Tokyo being at the forefront of introducing the technology ahead of the 2020 Games, they will help spread solar roads across the rest of the country.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

consequences if MPs do not follow the wishes of Brexit voters. She said: \u0026ldquoThe reality is that everyone in the Tory party is so scared of having a Tory leadership contest \u0026ndash so scared of being forced somehow into a general election and Jeremy Corbyn winning that they are not willing to risk anything.\u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll win the votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, the House of Lords amendments.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Odds on a record summer are shorter than ever.”The Met Office is warning emergency services, transport leaders, business chiefs and councils of the risks of a hotter-than-normal three months ahead.Britain is set to wilt due to high pressure, which brings hot and dry conditions, the Met Office said.Last year saw grim school holidays spoil summer, summer 2014 was ruined by rain following ex-Hurricane Bertha, and 2012 had the wettest summer for 100 years.But 2009 was a hot summer – and the 2006 summer sizzler saw a peak of 36.5C on July 19, at Wisley, Surrey.The Met Office June-August forecast said: “For June-August, above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures.“The probability the UK average temperature for June-August will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 40 percent.“The coldest of our five categories is around 5 percent.“The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than usual. The Met Office long-range prediction system shows a slightly increased chance of high-pressure patterns across the UK.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The warmest summer since 2006 is a possibility, after recent years saw a series of disappointing summers.“The June to August period only needs to be 1C above average for it to happen.”Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, owned by The Weather Company, said: “33C is expected by early July as heat from high pressure over Britain builds.”Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “There\u0026#8217s plenty of sunshine to come this week, with the South generally fine through the week, although the North-West will be changeable from Wednesday.“There is a signal for a gradual return to more settled weather through the end of June.

I would have done the same even if they weren’t the biggest.“I feel really happy with my body, just the way it is right now - the opposite of how I felt in the past,” she said.While the Instagram star has loved Barbie dolls since her childhood, her cosmetic transformation began after she was bullied at school for being “ugly.”She said: “I wasn’t originally very pretty and I used to be bullied a lot. I like to look like a doll because I would like to look faultless.”But while she has gained thousands of fans online, her “plastic” look has also attracted critics.Paris said: “Other people’s opinions on my looks vary. Some find my appearance good, some don’t - which is of course understandable, because everybody has a different ideal when it comes to beauty.“In spite of that, I have a lot of support. From my grandma, for instance, though she isn’t happy with my appearance.”The model’s loving grandmother Doris Lemke, with whom she lives in Berlin, has cared for Paris after her many surgeries including her most recent boob job.After her granddaughter was bullied and left feeling deeply insecure, Doris agreed to pay for her first breast implants when she was just 18.Since her first breast op, Paris has had a nose job, procedures and fillers to change the shape of her face, and her second and third breast ops.The German beauty has forked out more than £35,000 to achieve her pneumatic, doll-like appearance.Her grandmother, Doris said: “I don’t agree with all the surgeries Paris has, but she expresses herself this way because she was bullied and now she wants to look different than she used to.”Paris currently has over 200,000 Instagram followers, and frequently posts lingerie-clad snaps from photoshoots, often garnering thousands of likes on the social networking site.As with many social media models, the curvaceous star said she receives some unsavoury requests from fans.She said: “I get numerous offers from men to meet me in exchange for money, sometimes very high amounts, but I reject them. I wouldn’t do such things.”While Paris says she will never say never to more surgery, she’s very content with her appearance for the time being.She said: “I’m really happy that my dream came true and everything is going the way it is for me right now.“I simply love to look completely artificial.

But the Migration Watch think tank warned Mrs May that failure to curb EU migration after Brexit would destroy the Tory party’s credibility with voters.Its boss Lord Green said: “Controlling our borders must mean reducing immigration or it is pointless. 62% want to see a reduction in low skilled migration while 80% of EU migrants over the last ten years have been lower skilled. So any new arrangements must involve a sharp cut in immigration from the EU or the credibility of the Conservative government will be in shreds.”And Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful backbench European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the ambush would only backfire on the EU.

this Autumn, with both countries experiencing an outbreak of Zika and dengue fever.And the concerns on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are particularly pressing should the couple wish to have kids in the near future.Zika can be passed on from mothers to babies in the womb – which can lead to babies being born with severe birth defects.Women hoping to fall pregnant are advised to avoid conceiving for up to six months after returning from Zika-affected areas \u0026#8211 possibly putting the couple\u0026#8217s baby plans on hold.Ladbrokes have 4/6 odds that Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, will announce they are expecting a baby before the end of this year.According to the National Travel Health Network and Centre website, Fiji is considered to have a moderate risk of Zika virus transmission, with pregnant women urged to consider postponing non-essential travel.Tonga is also warned as having a moderate risk.Travellers are warned to avoid mosquito bites \u0026#8211 particularly between dusk and dawn \u0026#8211 with no vaccination or medication currently available to prevent Zika.It is understood members of the Royal Family are always aware of travel advice.Zika is mostly spread by the bites of infected Aedes species mosquitoes, which bite during the day and night.However, Zika can also be transmitted sexually with the virus able to stay in an infected male’s semen for months.Most worryingly, it can be passed on from mothers to babies in the womb – which leads to babies being born with severe birth defects.One of the best ways to prevent catching Zika is to prevent being bitten by a mosquito.Wearing insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers and avoiding stagnant water can all help limit your risk of being bitten.Symptoms include:A source told The Mirror: \u0026#8220The Duke and Duchess will have taken advice at the highest level before deciding that they were happy to go ahead and plan the trip.\u0026#8221The official royal

will coincide with the Invictus Games, created by Harry, when it is to be held in Sydney later this year.But a source suggested that Meghan might skip the trip if she falls pregnant before October.Ladbrokes spokesperson Jessica Bridge said to The Sun Online: \u0026#8220It’s clear to see how much family means to Harry and Meghan and, should they be lucky enough to have children, the odds suggest they will be wasting no time in becoming a family of three.”Paddy Power have cut the odds of Harry and Meghan’s first child being born this year from 20/1 to 4/1.Harry and Meghan will be following in the footsteps of his parents, the Prince of Wales and Diana, whose first royal tour as a married couple was also to Australia and New Zealand.During that trip, Charles and Diana travelled 23,601 miles and spent 41 days overseas.Meghan made her Buckingham Palace balcony debut on Saturday for the Trooping of the

George took aim with a toy gun as he and sister Charlotte — gripped by watchful mum Kate — enjoyed a day in the sun watching dad William play polo.Adorable Princess Charlotte, 3, was seen doing rolly-pollies as she showed off to her giggling mum — and tearing across the fields in her bare feet after her older brother.She was also pictured being cuddled by Kate as the family relaxed on the sidelines.Earlier Kate, 36, comforted tearful George as he became overwhelmed with excitement — but the young prince was soon mucking about once again.The match was all in aid of two charities close to the prince\u0026#8217s heart — the Royal Marsden Hopsital, which the Duke supports as president, and homeless charity Centrepoint, of which he is patron.Sunday\u0026#8217s match was part of a

order to use the bathroom at the fast-food restaurant in Maroochydore, Queensland, customers claim they have to first place their order and use the code on the bottom of the receipt to get access to the toilet - a system in place at multiple McDonalds restaurants in the UK.Numerous people have taken to social media to criticise the policy and claim the amount of extra time it takes to go the bathroom has already caused one “accident” and other near-misses.Maroochydore local Kim McDonald shared a picture of the sign informing customers of the location’s policy.The sign was attached to the toilet door and read: “Toilets proudly provided for the use of McDonald’s customers. Code on bottom of receipt.”Ms McDonald posted the image to social media after going to the fast food store for lunch with her 90-year-old grandmother.Her grandma has to use a walker to get around and she said this meant it took them about five minutes to walk from the carpark to the toilets, only to realise that they had to walk back and order to get in.“At least 10 or so minutes would have passed where a near 90-year-old has had to hold their bladder,” Ms McDonald wrote.“They are lucky they didnt need to get out the mop and buckets. And probably lucky I didnt have my kids with me too.”She thought that the locks may have been introduced as a way to stop drunk youths from vandalising the bathrooms late at night but still described it as a “bit of an overkill”.“Why cant the doors be unlocked until a later time like 8pm or something to allow easy access to the bathrooms for kids, pregnant ladies and disabled or elderly people?” Ms McDonald wrote.A couple of weeks earlier another woman, Jo Anne, took to Facebook to complain about the toilet policy claiming her child had an “accident” because of the coded locks.“Today my child has an accident because you lock the toilets and only put the code on the receipt,” she said.“They WERE customers who were using your facility and had decided (like plenty of other parents) to have a play in the playground before ordering their afternoon ice cream treat.”She added that the store “failed” to meet the standard expected of McDonald’s restaurants.A McDonald’s spokesperson responded to Jo Anne’s criticism saying they would raise the concerns with the Maroochydore location.A spokeswoman for the chain told theABC it is not policy to lock bathroom doors but it was the decision of the store.“The local licensee has made this decision, however, they are able to be opened for anyone who requires them,” she said.A version of this article was originally published on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004100417457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\u0026quality=100\" alt=\"Kim Jong-un these days is known as a hard-boiled dictator \" width=\"960","title":"kim jong un intelligence files school boy switzerland","story":"The analysis carried out for America and South Korea paints a picture of a young Kim which bears striking similarities with his 36-year-old self.A source who spoke to new-site Axios said: “The picture that emerged from literally dozens of interviews bears a striking similarity with the man he has emerged into today,“Gluttonous, prone to fits of anger and swaggering around his classmates. “Kim Jong-un was an [inattentive] student but demanded slavish loyalty from other children in his wake.”The findings came about after compiling and analysing numerous interviews with teachers, students and others who knew him at his prestigious Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in Koeniz, south of Bern.Kim attended from the age of 11 in 1994 and stayed there until 1997.The source even alleged young Kim was something of a hooligan who “frequently” hit other students, didn’t do well in school and was often distracted.But chillingly after games the North Korean would reportedly declare: “Someday you will all remember me.”The alleged revelations comes as the two leaders, both who have very strong personalities, meet in Singapore in a bid to avert war breaking in the Korean peninsula over Kim’s nuclear missile programme.

Wonsan is one of several special economic zones in North Korea. It\u0027s a model similar to the one pioneered by China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In theory, there are several benefits.\"North Korea could conduct special policies and give all kinds of privileges to foreign companies to do business in that area,\" Prof Cheng said.\"Also, the special economic zones could help isolate this area from the other part of North Korea so North Korea could go ahead with some special arrangement with foreign economies.\"But reality - and North Korea\u0027s pursuit of the nuclear part of the Byungjin line - got in the way of the plan. \"You see in the past years North Korea has set up more than 20 special economic areas but they\u0027ve basically failed because of international sanctions - foreign companies aren\u0027t allowed to invest in the country.\"That\u0027s what Mr Kim wants from the summit: not economic aid from the US (North Korean statements have been scathing about that idea) but the opportunity to attract foreign investment. That requires sanctions being lifted.Dandong is a Chinese city on the China-North Korea border on the other side of the Yalu River is Sinuiju, another North Korean special economic zone. A single-lane bridge connects the two countries. Here we saw an uneven flow of trucks, trains and tourist make the journey across.Further along the river, there\u0027s an impressive new bridge. It was completed in 2015. Well, nearly. The North Korean side ends in a field, with no connection to a road. Dandong is primed for North Korean trade but it\u0027s currently on pause. We visited the main fish market, which used to stock plenty of North Korean seafood. Sanctions imposed in 2017 put an end to that, although China is said to have relaxed the ban recently. We were offered North Korean clams, which are prized for their sweetness.Residents are optimistic about the US-North Korean summit - and what it means for their wealth. Zhang Tong, an estate agent working at Moon Island, a complex of soaring towers, says the summit has accelerated sales.She gestures to the North Korean side, in full view from the balcony of one show home. \"In front of us, several years ago, there weren\u0027t too many buildings,\" she said.\"If North Korea develops well, I think the friendship between China and North Korea will go better. And the economy and trade between the two countries will develop better too.\"And Dandong\u0027s economy will develop better too.\"None of that comes without risk, though - not least for Mr Kim himself, both internationally and domestically.Prof Cheng said: \"This time, when North Korea tried to change its gears, to single mindedly focus on economic development - such changes met resistance from other North Korean elites.\"Recently Kim Jong Un sacked three military guys - and that\u0027s the indication it\u0027s not easy for North Korea to change its policy in very dramatic ways.\" Mr Kim\u0027s nuclear arsenal might appear to give him a position of strength but the reality is more precarious. He must deliver economic growth to preserve his rule. But opening up will also bring its own pressures on the regime.And, either way, there\u0027s still the chance that Singapore won\u0027t even give him the opportunity to do so."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-city-skyline-banks_4293105.jpg?20180426144514 ","title":"north koreas dictator comes in from the cold","story":"Tom Cheshire, Asia correspondent on the Chinese border with North KoreaKim Jong Un\u0027s landing in Singapore on an Air China 747 showed how much North Korea relies on China diplomatically and envies it economically.

Growing evidence Farage’s nationalist hero, Tsar Vladimir Putin, backed Brexit to strengthen Russia by weakening Britain and Europe destroys what little’s left of dishonest Leaver claims we’d be stronger out the EU.  In the two years since squeaking a referendum we’ve discovered the Quitter elite are as clueless about delivering a workable Brexit as Love Island’s ignorant poseurs. I’m no fan of Theresa May or Chancellor Phillip Hammond but the real Tory villains – after David Cameron, losing Europe – are Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove and Liam Fox. Yelling from their Brexit playpen that it’s everybody else’s fault when they’ve nothing practical to offer beyond messianic false promises is an evasion of responsibility on an unprecedented scale.

The Prime Minister will appeal for support as she addresses a make-or-break meeting of the 1922 Committee - a group for backbench Tories. Her speech in Parliament comes amid fresh questions over her future as the EU Withdrawal Bill reaches its climax. MPs will vote on 15 amendments this week which, if passed, would tear up Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan and leave Britain closer to EU rules. The Prime Minister will tell her MPs: We must be clear that we are united as a party in our determination to deliver on the decision made by the British people. They want us to deliver on Brexit and build a brighter future for Britain as we take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.  The Prime Minister is now caught in a double bind between Remainers and Brexiteers in her own party. On the one hand, she has to persuade Remainers she will listen to their fears about Hard Brexit and stop them rebelling this week. On the other, she has to persuade angry Brexiteers that she\u0027ll make Brexit \u0027hard\u0027 enough to stop them toppling her later on.  A source told the Sunday Times she is “toast” once the Bill finishes its journey through Parliament. Prominent Tories have spent the last day speaking out against the rumours and trying to ensure unity. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd , a Remainer, and Brexit-backing Iain Duncan Smith called on Tories to “march in lockstep” ahead of the crunch Brexit Bill votes tomorrow and Wednesday.  They said a lack of Tory unity could hand power to Labour, warning: “We cannot allow ourselves to become divided and risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful Hard Brexit-backing European Research Group, called on Brexiteer MPs to show patience but admitted it was not going as fast as he\u0027d like.  Tory MP and former Vote Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers played down any talk of a coup, saying: I think it would be totally the wrong thing to do to any way undermine the prime minister. It comes after a week in which Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to quit and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that US President Donald Trump would be better at negotiating the UK’s EU withdrawal.  Former Chancellor Ken Clarke also called for unity. He said: “We need to rescue the Prime Minister from this terrible treatment she is getting from key members of her Cabinet.” Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer downplayed the votes this week as Labour faces its own split over whether to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which would mean following single market rules. The Norway model refers to countries being members of the European Economic Area (EEA), but not the European Union. Remaining in the EEA would grant Britain all the freedoms of the EU’s internal market - including the free movement of goods and people. Norway is an EEA member, which is why it\u0027s called the Norway model. It means the country is bound by all the EU regulations for those areas, as well as policies on employment, the environment and consumer protection. But, like Norway, it means the country does not have a say in how those policies are formulated. He said: “The idea that this is the last-chance saloon on a single-market deal is misconceived. There will be another chance with those bills.” Mr Davis is currently in Brussels for further talks with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The PM’s deputy, David Lidington , denied talks were doomed. “We have put something on the table. Michel Barnier has responded constructively. “I am not expecting a meltdown.” MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the law that enacts Brexit. Theresa May wants MPs to overturn 15 amendments, passed by the House of Lords, that would push Britain towards a much softer Brexit. It could make or break her premiership so she\u0027s been pleading for Tory Remain-backers not to vote against the government. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a summary of the original 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they would achieve if they pass.  Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. It could force her back to the negotiating table instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment. (1, 3)  For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of the above will be overturned, some could pass if there\u0027s a Tory rebellion. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through."},{"url":null,"title":"bedsit bedroom kitchen goes market","story":"NewsBedsit with bedroom in the kitchen goes on the market for staggering £1,100-a-monthLocals in Hampstead - where tiny studio flats sell for more than £350,000 and five-bed homes sell for close to £4m - were outraged at the price\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByStian Alexander08:17, 11 JUN 2018NewsThe bedsit is listed as a studio flat\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bedsit withja bedroom in the kitchen has gone on the market for a staggering \u0026pound1,100-a-month. Locals in Hampstead - where tiny studio flats sell for more than \u0026pound350,000 and five-bed homes sell for close to \u0026pound4m - were outraged at the price of the bedsit, advertised on the internet last week. Five photos of the bedsit, which is listed as a \u0027studio flat\u0027, show a cramped flat, which only has room for a single bed tucked at the back of a narrow kitchen. The snaps show a clothes rail above the mircowave, with shelves above the bed stacked with a toaster, kettle, iron and water filter jug.  The other photos show the flat\u0027s only other room - the bathroom, which only has a shower, loo and a tiny sink. Despite the minuscule size of the bedsit, it is described as a \u0027modern small self-contained studio flat in the heart of Hampstead village\u0027 - which requires a \u0026pound500 deposit. The bedsit is also on the main road, the A502 Rosslyn Hill, meaning traffic noise could be a major issue. The blurb for the bedsit reads: Suitable for single occupancy.  Modern small self-contained studio flat in the heart of Hampstead village. Very pleasant and high quality finish. Fully fitted kitchen with washing machine/dryer and microwave oven included. Plus shower room. All bills included including wi-fi. References required plus holding deposit. Fabulous highly prestigious location. 3 minutes to Hampstead Underground Station - references will be required.  It states that the \u0027studio flat\u0027 has no parking, no garage, no garden, no balcony, no disabled access - and that pets and smoking was not allowed, and that only \u0027professionals\u0027 would be considered as tenants. Local Nicholas Pollard, 31 - who is looking to move into he area after landing a job as a graphic designer - said he was horrified when he spotted the bedsit as he searched for somewhere to live. He said: I saw the bedsit and thought it would cost maybe \u0026pound500 at a push, but it is on for \u0026pound1,100-a-month. That\u0027s more than \u0026pound13,000-a-year to live in a tiny box with a bed in the kitchen - it must be the most expensive bedsit in Britain.  He said he was now looking to live in south London and commute to work in Hampstead, adding: I can get a two bed flat with a garden for \u0026pound1,100 in south London, so I think for quality of life purposes I\u0027ll look there instead. Robert Taylor, of the Camden Federation of Private Tenants, told the Camden New Journal newspaper that you can reach the fridge while lying in bed. He said: The advert is a typical example of letting agent speak where it describes the property as having a fully fitted kitchen, rather than the kitchen is the living space.  Sadly, we suspect that people have been falling over themselves to live in this tiny space where you can reach the fridge while still lying in bed because it\u0027s located \u0027in the heart of Hampstead village\u0027. Local Tory councillor Oliver Cooper said it was an \u0027absurd\u0027 price to pay.

Self-confessed lothario Daniel Wagster, 29, and three pals dined out on high-end steaks at a Piccolino restaurant in July 2016 while celebrating a friend\u0027s birthday. They also ordered four bottles of champagne to help wash the whole lot down - with prices starting at \u0026pound30 each. The group racked up a \u0026pound450 bill during the course of a six-hour stay at the Italian eatery in Stockton Heath near Warrington, Cheshire.  At the end of the meal, Wagster was left with the bill but complained about the quality of two of the steaks - which was deducted from the total - and the slow service. Wagster continued drinking in the outside area before he made a swift getaway after making no attempt to pay the bill, a court heard. He was jailed for eight weeks at Warrington Magistrates\u0027 Court on Wednesday.  Wagster, from Manchester, was also ordered to pay the outstanding \u0026pound447.50 bill to Piccolino. Prosecuting, Debbie Byrne said: When the restaurant staff brought the bill over to the table, Wagster complained about the quality of two of the steaks and these were deducted from the total. He then told staff that the service was too slow and the group were going to carry on drinking in the outside area. Defending, Zoe Earle said: Wagster had been out celebrating a friend\u0027s birthday. Four of them went for food, two males and two females and more friends joined for drinks.  After complaining about the steaks, Wagster said he would pay for the bill and continued drinking for several hours. He was left by his friends to pay for the bill. He has been made a scapegoat in this matter. Chairman of the bench of magistrates, Alan Davies sentenced Wagster to eight weeks in prison and ordered him to pay the \u0026pound447.50 bill to Piccolino. Wagster has 12 previous convictions for 16 offences including assault, burglary and harassment.

The new Duchess of Sussex, 36, wore her dark hair in loose ringlets as she joined Prince Harry at the traditional summer spectacle. Meghan experienced the pomp and pageantry of the event for the first time when she arrived on Horse Guards Parade with Harry in a carriage, along with the Queen\u0027s cousin the Duke of Kent. The couple were greeted by the sight of hundreds of Guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins lined up on the parade ground - Henry VIII\u0027s former jousting yard - as the event began. Harry, 33, did not travel on horseback alongside his brother William because he is not a Regimental Colonel. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who married three weeks today, travelled from Buckingham Palace along The Mall to cheers from royal fans gathered in the famous London thoroughfare. The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge were in another carriage while a third carried Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, the Countess of Wessex and her daughter Lady Louise.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a dress by Carolina Herrera and a hat by Philip Treacy, while Kate wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill. Camilla wore a pale blue silk dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a hat by Philip Treacy. Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial spectacle that brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the monarch\u0027s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers.  Meghan, Harry and the other members of the royal family took their place in Wellington\u0027s former office which overlooks the parade ground. Later this afternoon, the couple will join other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds. The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  More than 1,000 soldiers are taking part in the annual event with traditional display of pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not in attendance. The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen. They include the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards. Riding in the ceremony for the first time is the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  As with previous years, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall sat together in a carriage. The procession is accompanied by a Sovereign\u0027s Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets. After the ceremony the royal family will head back to Buckingham Palace and gather on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast. Among the 23 aircraft taking part are modern jets and historic aircraft, while the Red Arrows will be the finale.

The future king was with his sister Princess Charlotte and mum Kate as they watched his dad, the Duke of Cambridge, take part in a polo match.  The four-year-old royal was seen looking down the barrel of the toy as he and other youngsters played with fake weapons and handcuffs during the family day out. At one point George, who has shown an interest in the police, even seemed to jokingly tease his mum by pointing the gun at her chin.  It is understood that George\u0027s toy was a water pistol that wasn\u0027t purchased for the young prince. It was won as a prize at a children\u0027s fair at Sunday\u0027s Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy match. The images sparked a debate on Twitter with anger and disappointment expressed by some, and others saying it was simply a case of \u0027kids being kids\u0027 that wasn\u0027t a big deal. But critics have said fake weapons shouldn\u0027t be seen as fun toys, and George and the other children shouldn\u0027t have been allowed to play with them.    The young prince did play with other toys, including a colourful \u0027slinky\u0027. Some critics argued that the toy guns - dark in colour with an orange plastic ring around the end of the barrel - looked too much like the real thing. One Twitter user wrote: Sad to see George playing with a gun when the whole country has a gun/knife crime situation. Maybe in training for killing wild life in later years. Thought he was a sensitive child. Better if he was seen playing with a toy car or football. Sadly the royals will never change.  This year has seen a surge in violent crime in London, with the Met Police launching at least 74 murder investigations so far. Another tweeted: This isn’t okay anymore... My American side here, biased maybe b/c of everyday #gunviolence in USA, but my British side agrees. No child in this day and age should look at any gun as a fun toy. This looks far too real. (And I LOVE Prince George, don’t get me wrong!). And one wrote: Here’s why the sight of Prince George playing with a toy gun is triggering for some of us. Black mothers in the US have to teach their sons not to play with anything (a toy gun, a cell phone, etc.) a policeman could claim looked like a real gun. Their lives depend on it.  Other Twitter users\u0027 came to George\u0027s defence following the polo event at Beaufort Polo Club, Gloucestershire. One wrote: Can’t believe people are booting off about Prince George playing with a toy gun and handcuffs! He’s a child most likely playing cops and robbers! People are so dramatic. Another added: Prince George was playing with a toy gun? So what! It’s a toy! People get over yourselves and let others parent how they see fit as long as they’re not causing harm or anguish to their kids. Some pointed to the fact that George comes from a family with a military and hunting background.

The duo seem inseparable, never straying too far from each other.  But at one point, it all got too much for little George who had a tearful moment and needed to be consoled by his mum, Kate. He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem. They were undoubtedly delighted to be reunited at today\u0027s match and were joined by George\u0027s mum, Kate, sister, Princess Charlotte, and Savannah\u0027s mum, Autumn Phillips, and sister, Isla. Savannah is one of the Queen\u0027s great grandchildren, and her dad Peter Phillips is Princess Anne\u0027s son.  It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part. He kicked off his shoes and even guided his big cousin, seemingly showing her how it\u0027s done.

Hannah Sandover, 18, had been dating her ex-boyfriend, also 18, for nearly a year when they split. She later told a pal he had spiked her water bottle and forced himself on her in the back of his car during a trip to the Westbury White Horse in Wiltshire. Her worried friend went to police and Sandover gave a statement saying: He became forceful and pinned me down, I kept telling him to stop. I think he had drugged the water I was drinking.  She claimed she got into the back of car to stretch out in an attempt to ease stomach pains, before her former boyfriend jumped on her. Sandover, who was from Southwick, Wiltshire, at the time, said a friend was sitting in the front of the car, but was listening to music through headphones. But when she was taken to a clinic for an intimate examination her story started to change as she admitted she hadn\u0027t been drugged.

The Met Office has backed a scorching three-month summer forecast which will delight Brits ahead of World Cup BBQ parties and Wimbledon in July. This week, sub-tropical air from the Azores will see a week of 23C sunshine for the south of England, with showers after midweek in the north-west. And highs of 33C from late June are being forecast by The Weather Company. This summer will be the hottest since 2006 as long as June to August has an average UK temperature at least 0.87C above the 14.3C summer average, Met Office records show.  Government forecasts show there is double the usual probability of this summer having a higher temperature than 2013\u0027s 15.17C, which would make 2018 the hottest summer for a century. Bookmakers Ladbrokes cut odds on this summer being the hottest on record to the shortest ever offered – just 5/2. Spokesman Alex Apati said: “Punters and weathermen believe Britain will wilt. “Odds on a record summer are shorter than ever.”  Britain is set to wilt due to high pressure, which brings hot and dry conditions, the Met Office said. The national weather service is warning emergency services, transport leaders, business chiefs and councils of the risks of a hotter than normal three months. Last year saw a grim school holidays season, while summer 2014 was ruined by rain following ex-Hurricane Bertha and 2012 had the wettest summer for 100 years. But 2009 was a scorcher and 2006 saw a peak of 36.5C on July 19, in Wisley, Surrey.    A Met Office spokesman said: “For June-August, above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures. “The probability the UK average temperature for June-August will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 40 per cent. The coldest of our five categories is around 5 per cent. “The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than usual. “The Met Office long-range prediction system shows a slightly increased chance of high-pressure patterns across the UK.”    The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The warmest summer since 2006 is a possibility, after recent years saw a series of disappointing summers. “The June to August period only needs to be 1C above average for it to happen.” Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, owned by The Weather Company, said: “33C is expected by early July as heat from high pressure over Britain builds.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what kate middleton said princess","story":"NewsWhat Kate Middleton said to Princess Charlotte when they got onto the balcony for Trooping of the ColourPrincess Charlotte and her big brother George looked adorable as they waved to well-wishers from the balcony during Trooping of the Colour\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer09:29, 11 JUN 2018Updated09:34, 11 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was a busy weekend for the royal family as they celebrated the Queen\u0027s official birthday with the annual Trooping of the Colour parade.

Esther Taylor, who watched her mum battle the disease, has a gene mutation meaning she is at high risk. She underwent the gruelling nine-hour double mastectomy on March 2 in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of cancer which has haunted her family. Now, Esther believes she can look with optimism to a healthy future despite many thinking she was “too young” to make such a major decision.  The paediatric nurse from Preston, Lancs., has been offered support from Liberty X pop star Michelle Heaton, who also underwent the procedure. Speaking about the thought process behind the operation, the now 25-year-old said: “It was a difficult decision, it is scary, it is painful, it is risky and it is emotional, but ultimately it is brave, it is beautiful and it is life changing. “A lot of people I have told think I’m ‘too young’ to make this sort of decision, but if you knew you were living with a high risk of developing breast cancer and you had a choice to significantly reduce the risk, then why wouldn’t you?”  Blood tests had previously revealed Esther had a rogue unidentified gene, putting her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. It follows several members of her family being diagnosed with cancer including aunties, uncles and her mum Patsy Fenning, who was struck down in her 40s. Esther said: “My mum comes from a big family, I have sadly lost many members of my family to cancer and the majority of aunts and uncles that are still alive have suffered cancer, too.  “It suddenly hit me, there came a time when a cancer diagnosis in the family no longer shocked me. “I think at that point I realised it was a complete injustice to all these family members dying if I didn’t do something about it. “Ultimately, I didn’t want the deaths of those so close to me to be for nothing. I wanted to celebrate them with life.  Having had to watch, care and endure her own mum Patsy’s suffering when she was just eight years old, Esther, says the ‘C’ word was never far from her mind. Esther’s surgery, a nine-hour operation, took place on March 2 at Wythenshawe Hospital. Prior to the op, she had a ‘Bye Bye Boob’ party with colleagues from Royal Blackburn Hospital at a friend\u0027s house.  She admits, while the scars of the surgery are healing, emotionally and mentally she still has a way to go with further big decisions to face at a later date and taking confidence in a look that she still finds a little ‘alien\u0027. She added: “I went for a very like-for-like look, same size boobs and shape. “This for me was never a ‘boob job’ or a cosmetic decision. These aren’t my boobs.

Jessica O’Gorman placed as many as 90 orders over a seven-month period with George - the clothing and home section of the retail giant. Between April and November last year, she used its website to order goods - mainly clothing - and claimed refunds for a large amount of items, despite not sending them back. The 25-year-old, from Priestfields in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, had denied the charge of fraud by making a false representation but she was found guilty at a trial heard in May.  At sentencing on Thursday, Teesside Magistrates\u0027 Court heard the value of the goods gained fraudulently by O’Gorman was unknown. District Judge Timothy Capstick said: “Not every one was fraudulent but clearly there was a system in place and you knew how this particular shop operated. “It is quite clear there was a degree of sophistication in this offence. “The cost to the store is not clear but must have run into hundreds of pounds.” A report from the probation service said O’Gorman continued to maintain her innocence, insisted she returned the goods and “doesn’t see George as victims”.

The key to living well in a caravan or motorhome is efficient use of space. And below we\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords to tell you all the tricks of the trade for making the most of what you have. Follow these top accessorizing tips and all you\u0027ll have to worry about is where the next BBQ sausage or shandy is coming from as you relax and unwind. Happy holidays! Extend your space  No matter how spacious your caravan there\u0027s always going to be the need for a bit more space. With the glorious summer weather there\u0027s no reason not to move outside and create an additional living area, a lounge outdoors if you like.  The Urban Escape Event Shelter , above, has two sides and offers 50+ UPF, which means it filters out up to 98 per cent of UV rays. The water resistance is also capable of seeing off moderate rain too.   Rain or shine a gazebo is a great way to keep you comfortable. They offer shelter if it rains and sun protection if it\u0027s gloriously hot.    While you\u0027re out in the sun enjoying lunch you\u0027ll probably want something to sit on too, so take a look at the Urban Escape Folding Chairs , above, in either black or blue, for \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound20) or treat yourself to the ultimate in luxury with the Urban Escape King Size Moonchair , now just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound30).  Cook and eat outside  Cooking inside is all well and good, but there\u0027s nothing like a BBQ in the great outdoors.  You won\u0027t want to lug around a massive cooker though, so consider the Halfords Briefcase BBQ , a compact little device that will allow you to cook for a couple of people, or get two for larger families - they\u0027re only \u0026pound10 each (save \u0026pound5).   If you need some extra space for eating then the Halfords Aluminium Roll Up Table , below, is now only \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound10) and packs flat for easy storage in your caravan.    Pair this with the outdoor chairs we suggested earlier and you\u0027re ready for an outdoor meal with all the comforts of home. If sitting on the floor is more your thing, grab a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (save \u0026pound10) to keep you dry on damp ground.  It\u0027s also important to be able to keep meat, fish and drinks nice and cool when you\u0027re enjoying the outdoor cooking.   The Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox , above, offers temperatures 16 degrees celsius lower than the ambient temperature and can be powered from a 240v mains supply or a 12/24v car supply.  Absolutely perfect for caravan and outdoor use and the fitted wheels mean it\u0027s not a hassle to move heavy food about. It\u0027s also just \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25). Every home convenience  To attain the goal of real luxury you need to be able to relax in your caravan or motorhome and make it a home away from home.  Electricity is going to be important and while your motorhome or caravan might have a power hookup, it\u0027s worth packing an additional Halfords Triple Mains Kit which is down to just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound20) it\u0027s protected by an RCD and is splashproof.   This is a really useful accessory if you\u0027re using the Halfords 40 Litre coolbox above and it allows you some flexibility if you make a pit-stop en route.  You\u0027ll also want some nice tablewear to eat from, the good news is that Halfords has plenty of tough plates, cups and wine glasses that can survive life on the road and won\u0027t easily break.

Cody Runyon was swimming in a community pool in Rochester, Minnesota when he saw another boy passed out at the bottom of the pool. In the clip, Cody dives into the water before he emerges with another child and tries to carry him to the side of the pool. Another boy then helps him and they get him up onto the side of the pool where a woman called Desiree Pasko starts performing CPR on the boy.  There was no lifeguard on duty. Speaking about the incident, Cody said: “I went underwater, and all of a sudden, I see him just laying on the ground just sitting down in five feet, just passed out. “I grabbed him like that around the waist, and then his head was over my shoulder and I started carrying him.” Desiree Pasko said she initially thought the drowned boy was playing a prank before quickly performing CPR. She said: Adrenaline was so surreal at the time.  I pulled him out and initiated CPR … I could hear a small gurgle and his cheeks got pink. When his cheeks turned pink, I gave one more breath, I did two more big pumps, and then I tipped him over just praying that he would vomit and he did. I started screaming, \u0027He\u0027s alive!\u0027 He\u0027s alive! Paramedics arrived at the scene shortly afterwards and continued to treat the child.

PETA has been a major advocate of banning marine animal parks such as SeaWorld in the United States. Keith Guo, PETA Asia press officer for China, told Asia Wire: In 2016, PETA exposed this sea world made many belugas and dolphins stay in shallow tanks.

Ed Booker, 37, took part in the sinister ritual to rid a home of evil spirits - but he never realised the horrifying consequences it would have on his life. He claims his health rapidly went downhill and unexplainable things started happening after he participated in the paranormal cleansing. He says \u0027DIE\u0027 was scrawled on the inside of his windows and he even snapped an image showing the menacing circus worker lurking down a darkened corridor.  The final straw for his girlfriend Donna Hall, 31, came when she was attacked and pinned down by a macabre force at their home in Worthing, West Sussex, Ed claims. He said: “This ghost is ruining my life. My ex was attacked and pinned down. I’ve had mediums come in and they’ve been attacked too. “I’ve woken up with painful scratches down my arm. I feel like I’m in real danger.  “It has destroyed my relationship, my health is still suffering quite a lot. “I’m always depressed once I get out of the house I perk up but my mood drops as soon as I go back in. “I don’t know why it seems to want me. People have said it’s not the flat that’s evil, it’s you - it’s attached itself to you.” Ed has always been interested in the supernatural, and he has also taken part in several exorcisms as part of a ghost-hunting group.  The dark tale started when he and a team of paranormal investigators were called to rid a family home of dark forces, which had been tormenting the teenage son and his friends in Horsham, West Sussex. The events of that night were recently chronicled in Channel 4 docudrama True Horror. Ed said: “We didn’t like it as soon as we walked through the front door. Even the sceptics in the group didn’t want to go in. “When it came to do the clearing it just felt wrong. There were a lot of spirits there, all very negative.  “Then this figure came up in the middle of us - I can only describe it as a circus ringmaster, dressed all in black with a big top hat and a shovel on its shoulder. “It was just staring at us with a grin full of dirty, broken teeth. “It was an awful experience really. You never dream of something like this happening but it is real and it can happen.” In the following days, Ed - who takes tour groups around haunted buildings - said friends began seeing a tall, shadowy figure in the background. Ed even snapped some images claiming they show the ghost he claims is ruining his life.

European charity SOS Mediterranee said on Twitter yesterday that its rescue boat Aquarius had taken on board 629 migrants, including 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 other children and seven pregnant women.  The charity said the group of mainly sub-Saharan Africans were picked up in six different rescue operations off the coast of Libya and included hundreds who were plucked from the sea by Italian naval units and then transferred to the Aquarius. But Italy\u0027s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has said: My aim is to guarantee a peaceful life for these youths in Africa and for our children in Italy, using the Twitter hashtag We are shutting the ports.  Italy has asked the Mediterranean island of Malta to open its doors to the vessel, government officials said on Sunday. Malta brushed off the request, saying it had nothing to do with the rescue operation, opening the prospect of a diplomatic rift between the two European Union allies. The move by Italy\u0027s new interior minister, who is also head of the far-right League, represents an opening gambit to make good on his electoral promises to halt the flow of migrants into the country.  Malta takes in nobody. France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons,Salvini wrote on Facebook .  From today, Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration. More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years.  Numbers have dropped dramatically in recent months, but rescues have increased in recent days, presenting Salvini with his first test as minister. However, Salvini does not have authority over the ports and it was not immediately clear if his line would hold. The mayor of Naples, who has repeatedly clashed with the League leader, said he would welcome in the humanitarian boat. Naples is ready, without funds, to save lives, he said. The boat is now heading north towards a secure port, SOS Mediterranee tweeted on Sunday without specifying its destination, though virtually every such migrant boat over the past five years has ended up in Italy.  Its route north will take it past Malta, and the Italian government said its port authorities had written to the small island state asking it to let the Aquarius dock there. The island cannot continue looking the other way when it comes to respecting international conventions, said the statement, which was signed by Salvini and Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is nominally in charge of the ports. Malta said the rescue operations took place in international waters off Libya and were coordinated by Italy. Malta is neither the competent nor the coordinating authority in this case. Malta will observe prevailing laws, its government said in a brief statement.

monster new edition","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFrankenstein author Mary Shelley’s links to the city will be celebrated by a new Dundee edition of her “monster” story, which is to be published and distributed free to local children later in the year.Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus will be released online in a downloadable format, while thousands of hard copies will also be printed.Edited and introduced by Dr Daniel Cook, of Dundee University’s English department, the book will comprise the complete 1818 text of the ground-breaking science fiction novel, as well as dozens of commissioned images produced by award-winning local comics artists.“Frankenstein is one of the most influential novels ever written,” said Dr Cook. “It is studied in schools and universities across the English-speaking world, and everyone is in some way familiar with the story of the god-like scientist and his monstrous creation.”Shelley spent two years living on South Baffin Street as a teenager, from 1812-14, after her father, William Godwin, sent her to live with the wealthy jute-producing Baxter family.This spell would influence her, as she acknowledged: “It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered.”The project is funded by

people from a childhood in the opera to running a music studio tristans life in music","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe genre may have changed but the music Tristan Button grew up surrounded by still has an effect on him.The 37-year-old, who realised his dream of running a studio nine years ago when he launched Dundee Music Studios, said his father was president of the Tayside Opera for many years.\u0026#8220There was constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending most of his spare time being involved in music and going into so many studios, Tristan said he always had it in the back of his mind that he one day wanted to run his one of his own.He took a few business classes and looked into what it would involve, but the timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things, that I might not be able to keep running,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220But I persevered with it and it\u0026#8217s worked out.\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m never going to be a millionaire from running the studio but it\u0026#8217s more of a lifestyle job. I get to spend an awful lot of time with my kids which I\u0026#8217m quite grateful for.\u0026#8221There is still a lot of hard work which goes into the studio, with Tristan and Harris, one of the studio\u0026#8217s staff, staying up until 5am one recent weekend to prepare it for the launch of the Dundee Music Academy, but it\u0026#8217s paying off.The Academy is Tristan\u0026#8217s next big project and he wants to encourage more people to start playing music.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217ve got big plans for the music academy and high hopes for it,\u0026#8221 he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fe9ac928b.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures dundee youngsters take steps to show off their urban moves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of little groovers had the chance to show their moves in the city’s biggest dance festival.The festival, which took place at the Gardyne Theatre, saw approximately 600 children showing off what they have learned in their Urban Moves dance classes run by Leisure and Culture Dundee.Running over three days, the dance festival invited different Urban Moves classes to show off their skills to friends, family and other dance enthusiasts, ensuring all of the varying age groups got the opportunity to experience dancing on the big stage.“We have also now extended to evening classes for some of the more senior pupils from S1 upwards.“At the event all the kids were great – with so many children it could have been crazy but they were all fantastic and so keen to get up on the stage.“We work with them all year round to build up their confidence so there was no stage fright.

shop on Perth Road while his owner Carly Stevenson was inside – sparking a huge search operation lasting several hours.But the pet pooch was found three hours later enjoying the company of regulars at the Taybridge Bar.Carly had left Levi tied up outside a newsagent with Ollie, a Staffie, when the drama unfolded.The 29-year-old said: “It must have been around 8pm on Wednesday.“We were on our way to the park and I nipped into the shop.“It’s a regular trip and the dogs have been tied up countless times outside the store. When I came out of the shop Ollie was still there but Levi was gone.“Ollie started going towards the park so we started looking there. As Levi had broken out his harness, his name tag had come away as well.”The search for Levi, who will be two next month, stretched across the city with police officers even keeping an eye out for the dog.Carly said: “Given he is a husky and they have bounds of energy, we knew he could be anywhere.“I put a post up on social media and had family in Broughty Ferry looking for him too. I was obviously extremely worried about what had happened to him.“Two police officers had kindly joined in the search as well.”When Carly received a call from the Scottish SPCA she thought the worst had happened – only to discover Levi had simply befriended some folk having a cigarette outside the pub.She insisted Levi wasn’t in the doghouse for his antics, saying she was simply happy to have him back.She added: “When the call came in they told me, ‘he’s been traced safe and well in the pub’.“I couldn’t believe it as he had been missing from around 8pm until around 11pm.“We’d been searching all over the place and he was just across the road – in the pub of all places.”Kelsie Boland, 21, assistant manager at the bar, said its newest customer had stayed off the booze during his visit.She said: “We knew he was just a pup.“We gave him some food and he was really well behaved and got on well with the staff and the punters.“When Carly came in she was obviously upset but delighted to get him back.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1aab34690d0.jpg ","title":"get outside and enjoy these wonderful walks in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundonians looking to explore the city and get healthy at the same time are being urged to take advantage of walking trails which are right on their doorstep.Details of a range of routes – all of which can be found in Dundee neighbourhoods – have been made available by Dundee City Council.And with the fine weather expected to continue into next week, neighbourhood services convener Kevin Cordell is reminding residents of the benefits.Ranging from 15 minutes to one-hour, the strolls take in the city streets and landmarks, with the council website offering interesting historical facts about the areas.So whether it’s bird life or historical battles that take people’s fancy, Dundee has a lot to offer walkers.In Strathmartine, the 20-minute Dragons Walk takes in view of the Sidlaws while passing the former Baldragon Academy School site. In the Maryfield ward, people looking to get in their 10,000 steps for the day can tackle the city centre to Dudhope Park walk. While on the move, walkers can view Dudhope Castle, which served as a barracks during the First and Second World Wars.Anyone wanting to build up their stamina for this year’s Kiltwalk could tackle the West End Wander.The 3.4-mile route is likely to take just over an hour while passing the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Magdalen Green.Residents within the Coldside ward have an array of walks right on their doorstep, including the 35-minute Law Crescent walk. The walk starts at the supposed site of King Alpin’s battle between the Picts and Scots.Starting off at Kings Cross Hospital, the route goes around the foot of the law before passing near to St John’s High School.Historic castles feature on the East End Douglas Circuit.The one hour and 20 minute trek starts outside Douglas Library on Balmoral Avenue while taking in Claypotts Castle.And what could be better than a walk on the beach? The Sandy Beach walk starts at Broughty Castle and takes in more than three miles of picturesque scenery.To let off some steam, head for the Old Railway Stroll in Lochee. The 20-minute jaunt follows a path that used to form part of the Dundee to Newtyle railway line. Starting outside Lochee Library the first point of interest is the red stone public baths and library which were paid for the by the mill-owning Cox Family.Mr Cordell said: “The council is committed to healthy and sustainable forms of transport and walking is one of the simplest and best ways of getting around. Walking is a great way to stay fit and healthy and these routes help people to get into shape, but they’re also an excellent way to get out and about in our communities, meet neighbours and it’s free.”For full details on the walks, visit www.dundeecity.gov.uk/outdoor-access-in-dundee/health-walks-ward-and-grade.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good.

old school as people were saying really mean things and it would make me cry,” she said.“I know what it’s like to have issues with your mental health.”In all Daisy, who has aspirations of becoming an actor, raised £610 from her birthday cards and party alone.Another £60 has been donated through a fundraising page at justgiving/fundraising/daisy-mae-soutar.Daisy’s mum, Shona Anderson, said her daughter had made the decision to turn down gifts herself, adding: “I’m really proud of her.”Jo Anderson, director of external affairs at SAMH, was also full of praise for the generous teen.“A big thank-you to Daisy,” she said. “She is giving SAMH the best gift, helping us to create positive change for young people in Scotland.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/6598805.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Monday 11 Jun 2018 1:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

There always seems to be some excuse which is holding it back.\"Barber Greg Dodds, of For Men Only, was also frustrated at the lack of information.\"It seems ridiculous,\" he said.City centre manager David Haas said talks with the agents were progressing \"constructively\" but declined to comment on a possible start date.\"There are a number of issues relating to permission we are working through with council officials and the agent,\" he said.It has emerged that the council\u0027 principal officer for building conservation and environment, Andrew Puls, has raised concerns on conservation grounds regarding the proposed rebuild.In response to the application for the proposed demolition, he states the proposed replacement building is one storey lower and would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area\".A statement issued by two of the site owners, Mr Ali and Mr Cheng, states that \"regrettably\" unforeseen issues meant the scaffolding would not now be removed in June as originally envisaged.However it also claims that \"a new way forward\" being investigated should ultimately lead to a much speedier rebuild of the fire damaged building as well as allowing the owners to deal with various matters which had arisen from the recent planning application.Monday 11 Jun 2018 1:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111980.jpg","title":"Pilot helps jet fan take to the skies","story":"\u0026nbspA BOY with a keen fascination for planes saw his dream come true when a pilot took him on a surprise trip in a vintage jet.Inverness teenager Yusuf (14) was known to the pilots at the city airport as \"the threshold lad\" because he would regularly visit the edge of runway five to take photographs of aircraft.The autistic lad, who has asked for his surname not to be published, loves to watch the Jet Provost aircraft in particular and thinks of the airport threshold as his \"happy place\" \u0026ndash convincing his mother, Mhairi, to take him there whenever things in life get tough.She said: \"His love of aviation \u0026ndash civil and military \u0026ndash has been there since he was younger, but has grown over the years into his main hobby.\"Pilot Paul Gibbs found out about Yusuf\u0027 passion for planes after his wife got talking to Mhairi by the runway during an earlier flight for the jet.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective. You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful. Other contenders are Mac, Market Molly and Market Morag.A new plaque at the Market will honour the dog which was the only loss of life in the fire described by the Inverness Courier at the time as the most destructive in 40 years, causing estimated losses of \u0026pound12,000 and leaving families homeless.Monday 11 Jun 2018 1:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109726.jpg","title":"Ugliest buildings in Inverness to be redeveloped and castle converted","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA \"ONCE in a generation\" opportunity for Inverness has been grasped by Highland Council as it has confirmed plans to buy the ugly office blocks in Upper Bridge Street which have blighted the riverside for years.The Inverness Courier revealed exclusively last week how redevelopment of the site will form part of a bigger plan to create a major new tourist attraction at Inverness Castle once the courts transfer to the new justice centre in Longman Road next year.The local authority confirmed\u0026nbspon Monday\u0026nbspthat it has put together an ambitious \"\u0026pound5 million-plus\" bid to buy the office blocks and the public will be consulted over what will go in their place.A deal is about to be signed with property firm Inverness Estates which currently owns the two 1960s buildings and retail outlets underneath.The sale price is commercially sensitive at the moment, but is expected to be disclosed at the end of the month.Highland Council already owns the neighbouring museum block.It has branded the project \"Inverness Castle \u0026ndash spirit of the Highlands\" and it will feature information and stories about the Highlands, with the aim of inspiring people to visit other parts of the region. It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Monday 11 Jun 2018 1:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former aberdeen students secure 300000 funding for bar idea","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo former Aberdeen university students have secured more than £300,000 in funding for a business venture.Ebar Initiatives Ltd, founded by Robert Gordon University (RGU) alumni Sam Pettipher and Nick Beeson, hope their drink dispensing technology will reduce the time people spend waiting in bar queues at music and sports events.The company’s drinks dispenser will allow customers to complete a transaction for two drinks in just 20 seconds.Now, with the cash boost from Jensen SEIS and EIS fund, Sam and Nick hope to further develop the technology and build their first dispensing units.Commercial director Nick said: “We have already demonstrated that our technology works, and this funding injection provides us with capital to develop a production Ebar unit.“We look forward to launching it with our partner venue operators later this year.”Sam and Nick recently returned to RGU for MBA Leadership Week.Director of MBA at RGU Dr Ian Broadbent said: “Sam and Nick recently returned to the classroom where it all began.“It was great to hear that they have used elements of the MBA daily, and we’re delighted that they’ve achieved this important milestone.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/Original-Hollywood-H-420x564.jpg ","title":"historic hollywood memorabilia arrives in north east ahead of world tour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA slice of Old Hollywood glamour is coming to Oldmeldrum this afternoon with the arrival of a historic piece of memorabilia ahead of its world tour.The ‘H’ of the original iconic Hollywood sign is in the north-east for a test assembly at James Fisher, North Meadows ahead of its global showcase.The sign, which stands as tall as 4 double decker buses, has not been seen in public for more than 40 years.It was in storage for decades before being bought by artist Bill Mack in 2012.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again.

The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

\"We all had a dull lecture to look forward to after lunch at the College when we saw a girl from the Anthony Nolan Trust looking for people to register.\n\"I had no knowledge of what the Anthony

the Stonehaven toddler\u0027s only hope.\nBut several unsuccessful doses of treatment failed to cure him from cancer during a four-month stay at the Royal Aberdeen Children\u0026rsquos Hospital.\nAnd consultants decided the only remaining option of saving Finn\u0027s life was a high-risk stem cell transplant.\nDuring countrywide searches for donors, it was found that Anthony in Galashiels was the perfect match.\nThe youngster underwent a successful transplant at the end of 2015, followed by more than 50 blood transfusions, before eventually being declared cancer-free.\nFinn remains cancer-free

Anthony Nolan\u0026nbsppassed on my number and Finn\u0027s mum made contact.\n\"It turned out I was a perfect match for Finn - a 12 out of 12, which could only be bettered if he had a twin.\n\"I have

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.

There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.

A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.  Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7799803.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Merkel   s spokesman offers    no interpretation    on G7 image","story":"              German chancellor Angela Merkel\u0026rsquos spokesman has not offered any advice on how to interpret a government photographer\u0026rsquos viral shot of the G7 summit.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

The Edinburgh parade was part of Processions, a mass participation artwork taking place simultaneously in the capitals of the UK to mark the achievements of the women\u0026rsquos suffrage movement.  The women and girls on the march wore suffragette colours of green, violet and white and were choreographed to appear as a moving suffragette flag.  The Edinburgh participants gathered at the Meadows before heading off through the city, ending by marching down the Royal Mile to the sounds of a piper playing Flower Of Scotland and past the Scottish Parliament.  Those taking part spanned all ages and many carried banners covering a range of causes.  These included embroidered banners thanking the \u0026ldquosister suffragettes, others proclaiming the suffragette slogans \u0026ldquoEquality for Women and \u0026ldquoDeeds Not Words and some simply stating \u0026ldquo100 years.  Modern political causes were also in evidence, with banners for the WASPI women fighting for pension equality.  Political parties were among the groups taking part in the parade, which was open to women and girls and those identifying as such, and other organisations involved included the Girl Guides and the Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Institute.  The event was produced by Artichoke and commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary.

Businessman Arron Banks, the founder of the Leave. EU group, is due to give evidence to the Commons inquiry into \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo this week.  After initially refusing, he has now agreed but says he is the victim of a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks admitted a single meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.  However the Sunday Times and Observer reported an email trail revealing further meetings between the two men and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore.  At one meeting, in November 2015, the day after the Leave.EU launch, the ambassador introduced Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore to a Russian businessman who offered a potentially highly lucrative business deal involving six Russian goldmines.  Mr Banks also visited Moscow in February 2016, during the referendum campaign.  And in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore met President-elect Donald Trump in New York, they had a lunch with the ambassador.  Mr Banks told the Sunday Times he also handed over phone numbers for members of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos transition team to Russian officials.  Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the discovery of the links was \u0026ldquobig news and very relevant to his \u0027fake news\u0026rsquo inquiry.  He told BBC Sunday Politics that the public had a \u0026ldquoright to know the nature of the contacts.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy. Did he make money out of it?  \u0026ldquoDid he use that money to fund campaigns? If he didn\u0027t then that\u0027s fine but given the prominent role he played we\u0027ve got the right to ask these questions.\"  Mr Banks, who gave \u0026pound12m in donations to Ukip and the Leave side, told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He later joked to Reuters that he was \u0026ldquostill waiting for the cheque from Moscow.  He said: \"This is just complete, absolute garbage - it is like the Salem witch hunt. They just keep on screaming \u0027witch\u0027, \u0027witch\u0027. They are trying to discredit everyone involved in Brexit.\"  Mr Wigmore said Leave.EU never offered any campaign information to any Russian.  The extent of the links with Russia was revealed in a cache of 40,000 emails shared by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore with the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit.  She said the two men had been \u0026ldquoshamelessly used by the Russians, but that did not invalidate the judgment of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU.  Leave.EU was last month fined \u0026pound70,000 for breaching election law in the EU referendum.  The Electoral Commission said the group, which was separate from the official Vote Leave campaign, failed to report at least \u0026pound77,380 of its spending.  It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.
