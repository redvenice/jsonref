She kept saying baby Hugo, who is her cousin, that’s all I understood. She’s just on a completely different planet.\u0027But he says the craziness started just months after his daughter had been born. And he claims her eccentricity is so well-established that teachers at her Montessori school have ditched her real name and simply call her Crazy. \u0027She was three months old was when we first started to take videos of her and that’s probably when the craziness started,\u0027 he said. \u0027There was a video where she was dancing on our window sill and that was the first video we put on Instagram.          Daisy has been entertaining Alan since she was three months old, which is when he says the craziness started \u0027The videos I take are not staged, I don’t plan any of them and she’s actually a very shy person until you get to know her - like any three year old. I think she warms to people.’He put a stop to any doubters who believe that \u0027Crazy Daisy\u0027 is mimicking her parents as they feed her instructions.  \u0027A lot of questions are being asked and comments saying she must be imitating me and Michelle, my wife, but she actually isn\u0027t,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even with the phone call in the video - we genuinely wouldn’t be on the phone like that because we don’t have a landline.

but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part.Shoppers might be disappointed to learn that there will be no plush toys available in Sir Elton\u0027s likeness this year, with the retailer instead selling four pianos - two uprights for around £800 and two keyboards starting at £150 - and a range of vintage tour t-shirts. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The advert\u0027s nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after an eight-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who had both been fired from his entourage after decades working for him.But on her 90th birthday he sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died two years later he spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.It added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.          The advert has been met with mixed reviews on social media with some viewers labelling it \u0027beautiful and powerful\u0027 and others asking if it is merely a promotional ad for the singer\u0027s upcoming tour John Lewis has moved away from cuddly toys this year and fans of the advert can enter a reproduction of Sir Elton\u0027s lounge now built in its Oxford Street store          The music studio where Your Song was recorded has also been lovingly rebuilt in the Oxford Street where shoppers can touch the mixing desk and play the grand piano          As part of the experience Elton\u0027s 1970s dressing room is open to the public where they can try wigs, glasses and his clothes  Classic tour T-shirts will be sold in John Lewis store but there will be no cuddly toys or other similar gifts for the 2018 advert\u0027It\u0027s just one big plug for Elton!\u0027 John Lewis ides fans with \u0027not very Christmassy\u0027 festive advert as retailer is accused of \u0027selling out\u0027 by promoting singer\u0027s farewell tour and Rocketman film biopic Fans of the John Lewis Christmas advert are split today over the decision to have millionaire Sir Elton John at its heart.Critics have called the retailer\u0027s 2018 campaign a \u0027sell out\u0027 and a \u0027plug\u0027 for the star\u0027s farewell tour and his Rocketman biopic starring Taron Egerton, which is due for release next year.But others including stars James Corden and Susanna Reid have praised it with some fans claiming it is the retailer\u0027s \u0027best ever\u0027 Christmas commercial.Many said its message that one present can change a life reduced them to tears.   Some fans loved it - and saw it as a happy distraction from the Brexit chaos consuming the UK - with many crying through itThe £7million advert tells the tear-jerking story of his rise to fame and fortune from humble beginnings in Pinner, north London, where he was brought up by his mother Sheila and grandmother Rita.It ends with a four-year-old Elton - then Reg Dwight - unwrapping his first piano on Christmas Day in 1951 then cuts back to the present say showing the emotional 71-year-old playing the same instrument in front of the tree.It is followed by the slogan: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027 and the retailer has today started marketing pianos for £800 - the first time it has sold them for decades.Twitter went wild when it was released this morning - but it has split opinion.@mollytomkinss said: \u0027I feel truly sorry for anyone who can\u0027t understand the deeper meaning of the #JohnLewisChristmasAd this year.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Remember these? Moz the monster, Bouncing Buster, the Man on the Moon, Montie the penguin and a lovestruck snowman - EVERY John Lewis ad from the past ten years2017 John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles marks 70th birthday milestone family photograph","story":"Pick polka dots like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alessandra RichSold out!

Estimates vary on how many members it has. It secured 62 signatures on a letter to the PM in February while Mr Baker has claimed the group has a bloc of 80 Tory MPs willing to vote against May\u0027s plans.The group\u0027s deputy leader Mark Francois said today there were at least 40 hard liners who would vote against the deal in all circumstances. What do they want?  The ERG has said Mrs May should abandon her plans for a unique trade deal and instead negotiate a \u0027Canada plus plus plus\u0027 deal.This is based on a trade deal signed between the EU and Canada in August 2014 that eliminated 98 per cent of tariffs and taxes charged on goods shipped across the Atlantic.The EU has long said it would be happy to do a deal based on Canada - but warn it would only work for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.The ERG say the model can be adapted to work for the whole UK. They say Northern Ireland can be included by using technology on the Irish border to track goods and make sure products which don\u0027t meet EU rules do not enter the single market.They also say it would give complete freedom for Britain to sign new trade deals around the world to replace any losses in trade with the EU.  The group is content to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels will not give in.  How will they vote:  Against the Prime Minister.          Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan SmithModerates in the Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) and other LoyalistsWho are they? A newer group, the BDG counts members from across the Brexit ide inside the Tory Party. It includes former minister Nick Boles and MPs including Remainer Simon Hart and Brexiteer Andrew Percy. There are also many unaligned Tory MPs who are desperate to talk about anything else. How many of them are there? There are thought to be around 50 members in the BDG, with a few dozen other MPs loyal to the Prime Minister   What do they want? The BDG prioritises delivering on Brexit and getting to exit day on March 29, 2019, without destroying the Tory Party or the Government. If the PM gets a deal the group will probably vote for it.It is less interested in the exact form of the deal but many in it have said Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan will not work.Mr Boles has set out a proposal for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) until a free trade deal be negotiated - effectively to leave the EU but stay in close orbit as a member of the single market. How will they vote?  With the Prime Minister.           Tory Simon Hart leads a group of Tory MPs committed to getting a pragmatic Brexit deal without pandering to ideological interests Unrepentant Remainers in the People\u0027s Vote Who are they? A handful of about five Tory MPs - mostly former ministers - who never supported Brexit and think the failure of politicians to get a deal means Parliament should hand it back to the people. The group includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening. What do they want instead? A so-called People\u0027s Vote. The exact timing still needs to be sorted out but broadly, the group wants the Article 50 process postponed and a second referendum scheduled.This would take about six months from start to finish and they group wants Remain as an option on the ballot paper, probably with Mrs May\u0027s deal as the alternative. There are established pro-Remain campaigns born out of the losing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign from 2016. It is supported by Tony Blair, the Liberal Democrats and assorted pro-EU politicians outside the Tory party. How will they vote? Hard to say for sure. Probably with the Prime Minister if the only other option was no deal.            Anna Soubry is in a small group of unrepentant Remainer Tory MPs who want a second referendum on Brexit The DUP Who are they? The Northern Ireland Party signed up to a \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Conservative Party to prop up the Government.They are Unionist and say Brexit is good but must not carve Northern Ireland out of the Union. How many of them are there? 10. What do they want? A Brexit deal that protects Northern Ireland inside the UK. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister if the deal breaches the red line, with the Prime Minister if she can persuade them it does not. The group currently says No.      The DUP, led in Westminster by Nigel Dodds (right), have a deal with Theresa May but could still vote agianst her Brexit deal Labour LoyalistsWho are they? Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders. How many of them are there? Between 210 and 240 MPs depending on exactly what Mr Corbyn orders them to do. What do they want? Labour policy is to demand a general election and if the Government refuses, \u0027all options are on the table\u0027, including a second referendum.Labour insists it wants a \u0027jobs first Brexit\u0027 that includes a permanent customs union with the EU. It says it is ready to restart negotiations with the EU with a short extension to the Article 50 process.The party has six tests Mrs May\u0027s deal must pass to get Labour votes. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister\u0027s current deal.            Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders are expected to vote against the Prime Minister Labour Rebels Who are they? A mix of MPs totally opposed to Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, some Labour Leave supporters who want a deal and some MPs who think any deal will do at this point. How many of them are there? Up to 45 but possibly no more than 20 MPs.What do they want? An orderly Brexit and to spite Mr Corbyn.How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Other Opposition partiesWho are they? The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents.How many of them are there? About 60 MPs.How will they vote? Mostly against the Prime Minister - though two of the independents are suspended Tories and two are Brexiteer former Labour MPs.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Mother seven 38 demands larger council home","story":"    Alana Burns, 38, is due to give birth in March to twins, adding to her already sizeable brood including Stewart, 20, Bryan, 19, and Caitlin, 16, who live together above a pub in West LothianThe single mother said: \u0027My relationship with some of my children is at breaking point, we can\u0027t keep living like this.\u0027The council has been out to the leak and said they\u0027d get in touch with me, I have heard nothing.

The document says Northern Ireland would align with all single market rules so goods can circulate freely within the EU – but with no influence over them. Where EU law is applied, the European Court of Justice will remain \u0027ultimate arbiter\u0027, Government notes on the deal say.The terms of the backstop say UK officials will be responsible for policing EU law that still applies in Northern Ireland after Brexit – but EU officials can demand to be present.The laws are likely to regulation on products made in Northern Ireland and sold in the Republic.The European Court of Justice will be in charge of disputes about EU law that applies in Northern Ireland.Britain will take part in any cases at the ECJ as if it were still a member state, the document says.Both the EU and UK will have the right to say the backstop should end because a new trade deal makes it irrelevant.But neither side can act on it without agreement of ministers on both sides within six months.  Transition period extension The Withdrawal Agreement confirms a Brexit transition period - during which EU laws will continue to have effect in Britain - lasting until December 31, 2020.However, the deal allows Britain to request an extension to the transition period \u0027at any time\u0027 before July 1, 2020.An extension could allow Britain and the EU more time to reach a final deal over the Irish border.In his press conference after Mrs May\u0027s announcement Michel Barnier said the transition period could only be extended once.The Northern Ireland backstop would only kick in if no final agreement had been reached at the end of the transition period, the Government said.During the implementation period EU laws made in Brussels will continue to apply to Britain and the UK will be bound by the EU\u0027s international agreements.The UK is also expected to \u0027make a contribution to the Union budget\u0027 in 2019 and 2020 and until the end of the transition period.In addition, decisions of the European Court of Justice will continue to have \u0027binding force\u0027 in Britain, according to the agreement.          The DUP has already condemned the blueprint and suggested it could withdraw support from the PM (party Arlene Foster is pictured today)  Exit clause   Mrs May has won her bid for an independent panel – a \u0027joint consultative working group\u0027 – to decide on when the customs union backstop can end, to stop the UK being \u0027trapped\u0027. Under Article 20 of the Protocol, the UK would notify the EU if it believes the backstop is no longer needed.Within six months, the panel would decide if the EU was not acting in good faith over a solution to the Irish border problem. Designed to ensure the EU could not unreasonably block the UK from leaving the backstop, it is still well short of the unilateral break clause many Cabinet ministers wanted.The panel will be made up of two representatives from each side plus an independent person – likely to be judges. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox – who proposed the solution – reportedly suggested the solution is not legally watertight. However, senior government officials insisted there have been major changes to the text to ensure the backstop is temporary.Regulations The price the UK has paid for this customs backstop is to agree to swathes of EU rules designed to ensure a \u0027level playing field\u0027 and contained within a \u0027large annexe\u0027 to the agreement. Mrs May has said she wants the UK to follow a \u0027common rulebook\u0027 for goods and farm products in the trade deal.But the agreement is expected to cover many others including state aid rules – subsidises for industry – workers\u0027 rights, competition policy, environmental rules and tax, which Brexiteers, and some Remainers, warn means following Brussels regulations that we cannot influence.Divorce bill  The UK will pay around £39billion, but payments will become due over time – such as pension payments for EU officials. Half the cash pays for a \u0027transition\u0027 period between now and the end of 2020, when very little will change and the UK will stay within EU rules and institutions. Designed to avoid a Brexit \u0027cliff edge\u0027, this period will allow negotiations to resume on the future.Calls from Cabinet Brexiteers for the cash to be linked to the future deal appear to have failed. For the first time, the UK has accepted the transition period may have to be extended – but only once – before we move to the future relationship. Freedom of movement and citizens\u0027 rights Ending freedom of movement was a key demand for many who voted Leave, and will happen at the end of transition. Future immigration rules were not included in negotiations, so the UK has flexibility to set its own after that point, although the EU will push for preferential treatment in return for a better trade deal. The existing rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK and the one million Britons living in Europe have been guaranteed.Fishing  The deal on fishing is a win for Mrs May and will allow the UK to independently negotiate access to its waters and quota shares. Member states such as France and the Netherlands whose fishermen access UK waters demanded continued access.Instead, fishing terms will be negotiated separately during the transition. The EU will call for continued access in return for giving the UK market access to sell its fish products, where the British industry exports around 75 per cent of its haul.Thirteen Scottish Tory MPs including Scotland Secretary David Mundell said yesterday they could not support a deal that \u0027would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares\u0027. No agreement has been made on import tariffs, meaning the EU could hit UK fishermen with charges for selling on to the continent.Trade  The deal is expected to contain only a brief \u0027political declaration\u0027 on future trade arrangements running to around five pages and which is not legally binding. Ministers hope this will be beefed up in the coming days before MPs are asked to vote on the deal next month.Both sides have agreed that there will be zero tariffs and quotas on trade between both sides, which No 10 says is a victory. One senior official said the UK would be \u0027the only major advanced economy\u0027 with that relationship with the EU.On security, an agreement has been reached to share number plate information, fingerprints and DNA records but not the data on wanted criminals. "},{"url":null,"title":"Collection hilarious senior moment cartoons","story":"      Taken from THE BEST OF THE OLDIE CARTOONS 1992-2018, published by Oldie Publications at £7.95. © Oldie Publications 2018To order a copy for £6.36 (offer valid to 221118 P\u0026ampP free on orders over £15) visit www.mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640. "},{"url":null,"title":"The theatrical home life Crazy Daisy father confirms loves waffle on","story":"Alan (pictured, right, with his daughter, Daisy, who is also pictured left) says all the hilarity came straight out of her \u0027little head\u0027She was filmed talking into a landline phone by her father, Alan, who posted it online.The proud father-of-three spoke to the MailOnline and said \u0027theatrical\u0027 tendencies run in the family. He explained that his family were staying in a countryside hotel for his mother\u0027s birthday when his daughter picked up the phone and made her name as a viral video star.\u0027She was trying to ring other rooms and making pretend calls,\u0027 he said. \u0027She just sat on the bed and she just waffled on.   Daisy (left) went viral with her online antics and is pictured (right) with mother Michelle, father Alan, 13-year-old sister Alexandra and six-year-old brother Noah          Alan (pictured with Daisy and her mother, Michelle) says that his daughter\u0027s theatrical streak runs in the family \u0027She wasn’t even going to the park - I don’t know what she was talking about, I was thinking where the hell is she getting all this from!

She’s just on a completely different planet.\u0027But he says the craziness started just months after his daughter had been born. And he claims her eccentricity is so well-established that teachers at her Montessori school have ditched her real name and simply call her Crazy. \u0027She was three months old was when we first started to take videos of her and that’s probably when the craziness started,\u0027 he said. \u0027There was a video where she was dancing on our window sill and that was the first video we put on Instagram.          Daisy has been entertaining Alan since she was three months old, which is when he says the craziness started \u0027The videos I take are not staged, I don’t plan any of them and she’s actually a very shy person until you get to know her - like any three year old.

I thought I was going to die there.\u0027Breeden, who has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, was joined by other mentally impaired adults and their disability checks were stolen by Weston.She now focuses on her art and  three children, two of whom were born in captivity.Her youngest child, Ava Olivia, lives with Breeden and Breeden\u0027s parents in Kensington. \u0027She means everything to me.

She was also forced to drink her own urine.She testified that she was regularly beaten with bats, sticks and chains, shot with a BB gun, and held in a trailer where Weston brought \u0027older mans\u0027 to have sex with her.The woman told the court that she is working to build a relationship with her children, who found out in 2011 that she was their biological mother.  Federal prosecutors Richard Barrett and Faithe Taylor, who were both involved in the case, argued that the heinous deeds constituted hate crimes because Weston and her partners targeted people with disabilities who could not care for themselves.Faithe Taylor told NBC10: \u0027If you were a man, she would be your girlfriend. If you needed a mother, she would be your mother.\u0027Over the course of a decade, Weston moved her victims from a trailer in Texas to an attic in Virginia before eventually landing in Northeast Philadelphia.          Prosecutors Richard Barrett (left) and Faithe Taylor (right) said it was the worst case they ever encountered  and described the scene as \u0027the worst thing you could ever see\u0027   Gregory Thomas, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) were also accused of stealing the victims\u0027 Social Security checks          Weston\u0027s daughter Jean McIntosh was sentenced to 40 years in prison for her role in a decade-long plot to kidnap mentally disabled adults, enslave them and steal their government benefit checksLinda Weston\u0027s daughter, Jean McIntosh, 38, was also sentenced to 40 years in prison for her role in kidnapping, torturing and enslaving disabled adults in August 2018.Prosecutors counted at least a dozen victims throughout that time, including some who died in captivity. Others like Breedon gave birth in captivity as well.‘Some of the victims recount children they had that there is no record of,\u0027 Taylor said. They recount other victims we could not trace.\u0027Authorities said Weston forced two female victims into prostitution to earn more money for the family when they lived in Texas and Florida.Two other women died while living with Weston, leading to murder charges that made her eligible for the death penalty.

Weston allegedly staged the death to look like an overdose.When the charges were filed, Weston had already served time for the starvation death of a man she locked in her Philadelphia apartment nearly three decades ago.In September, Weston pleaded guilty to 196 criminal counts, including kidnapping, racketeering conspiracy and murder in aid of racketeering, hate crimes, sex trafficking and fraud in exchange for prosecutors agreement not to pursue a death sentence.  They instead recommended her current sentence.Weston has been in custody since October 2011, when a landlord found the four bedraggled adults locked in a squalid boiler room of a home in the Tacony section of northeast Philadelphia and called police.

In theory, she needs to win a simple majority, 159, to survive. But it is not that simple. When her predecessor John Major was challenged by John Redwood in 1995, he won by 218 to 89. But most agreed if Redwood had scored 100, Major would have been finished.Despite Iain Duncan Smith’s fighting talk that her ‘days are numbered,’ it will not be easy for IDS and his European Research Group Brexiteer Tories to get her out. It is made up of around 80 Conservative MPs.If Mrs May lost, or failed to win by enough to cling on, a leadership battle would ensue.Defiance in the Downing Street darkness: PM\u0027s speech in FULL...Leadsom cried and McVey \u0027went mental\u0027 before a civil servant...Share this articleJohnson, Rees-Mogg, David Davis and Penny Mordaunt would be likely to throw their hats in the ring on ‘hard Brexit’ platforms with Cabinet big-hitters Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt offering stability and ‘Remainers’ Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and possibly Boris’s brother Jo, standing with no real hope of winning, but determined to fly the pro-EU flag. The MPs would whittle the candidates down to two – with a final vote by all Tory members.Davis could capitalise on Tory MPs’ mistrust of Johnson. One or the other could face Javid or Hunt in the party membership play off.There is one issue that unites Conservative MPs at present: fear of another General Election. However, some of Boris Johnson’s supporters say that if he became Prime Minister, he could call a snap election on a ‘no deal’ Brexit manifesto, and if he won, make a Churchillian stand against Brussels with the nation – and a Parliamentary majority solidly behind him.There is one problem with this: when Mrs May called a snap election last year she very nearly handed the No.10 key to Corbyn.And Conservative MPs and voters fear that more than any – or no –Brexit deal. The Tory leadership tangle was summed up by Paul Goodman, editor of the influential ConservativeHome website.He said: ‘Having a leadership contest could present more problems than it solves for the Party.’ However, he offered little comfort to Mrs May: ‘It is easy to say Tories calling for her to go are like the boy who cried wolf. In the end, the wolf came.’  CAN Theresa May get the votes to pass her Brexit deal through Parliament? PM could need the support of more than FIFTY hardcore Tory Brexiteers AND Labour rebels If Theresa May gets Cabinet backing her deal will have to go to Parliament She can only be certain of around 230 votes but needs to get 318 MPs in favour  PM  needs to squeeze Tory rebels, win over the DUP and get some Labour votesBY TIM SCULTHORPE, DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR FOR MAILONLINETheresa May has secured her deal in Brussels but her fight to get it actually in place in time for Brexit day is just beginning.If the Cabinet agrees to the deal the biggest hurdle will be the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the plans in Parliament.  This is expected to take place in December to ensure the deal is over its biggest hurdle before the end of the year.   Theresa May will need 318 votes in the Commons if every single MP turns up. She can only rely on about 230 votes - meaning she will need to get back around half of the 80 hardcore Tory Brexiteer rebels and secure the support of the 10 DUP MPs, plus dozens of Labour MPs   Theresa May has secured her deal in Brussels but her fight to get it actually in place in time for Brexit day is just beginningThe Prime Minister needs at least 318 votes in the Commons if all 650 MPs turns up - but can probably only be confident of around 230 votes. The number is less than half because the four Speakers, 7 Sinn Fein MPs and four tellers will not take part. To win, Mrs May will need to get back around half of the 80 hardcore Tory Brexiteer rebels and secure the support of the 10 DUP MPs.Even then she will probably still need the help of dozens of Labour MPs to save her deal and possibly her job. This is how the House of Commons might break down: The GovernmentWho are they: All members of the Government are the so-called \u0027payroll\u0027 vote and are obliged to follow the whips orders or resign. It includes the Cabinet, all junior ministers, the whips and  unpaid parliamentary aides.How many of them are there? About 150. What do they want? For the Prime Minister to survive, get her deal and reach exit day with the minimum of fuss.Many junior ministers want promotion while many of the Cabinet want to be in a position to take the top job when Mrs May goes. How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG)Who are they? Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan Smith.How many of them are there? Estimates vary on how many members it has. It secured 62 signatures on a letter to the PM in February while Mr Baker has claimed the group has a bloc of 80 Tory MPs willing to vote against May\u0027s plans.The group\u0027s deputy leader Mark Francois said today there were at least 40 hard liners who would vote against the deal in all circumstances. What do they want?  The ERG has said Mrs May should abandon her plans for a unique trade deal and instead negotiate a \u0027Canada plus plus plus\u0027 deal.This is based on a trade deal signed between the EU and Canada in August 2014 that eliminated 98 per cent of tariffs and taxes charged on goods shipped across the Atlantic.The EU has long said it would be happy to do a deal based on Canada - but warn it would only work for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.The ERG say the model can be adapted to work for the whole UK. They say Northern Ireland can be included by using technology on the Irish border to track goods and make sure products which don\u0027t meet EU rules do not enter the single market.They also say it would give complete freedom for Britain to sign new trade deals around the world to replace any losses in trade with the EU.  The group is content to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels will not give in.  How will they vote:  Against the Prime Minister.          Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan SmithModerates in the Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) and other LoyalistsWho are they? A newer group, the BDG counts members from across the Brexit ide inside the Tory Party. It includes former minister Nick Boles and MPs including Remainer Simon Hart and Brexiteer Andrew Percy. There are also many unaligned Tory MPs who are desperate to talk about anything else. How many of them are there? There are thought to be around 50 members in the BDG, with a few dozen other MPs loyal to the Prime Minister   What do they want? The BDG prioritises delivering on Brexit and getting to exit day on March 29, 2019, without destroying the Tory Party or the Government. If the PM gets a deal the group will probably vote for it.It is less interested in the exact form of the deal but many in it have said Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan will not work.Mr Boles has set out a proposal for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) until a free trade deal be negotiated - effectively to leave the EU but stay in close orbit as a member of the single market. How will they vote?  With the Prime Minister.           Tory Simon Hart leads a group of Tory MPs committed to getting a pragmatic Brexit deal without pandering to ideological interests Unrepentant Remainers in the People\u0027s Vote Who are they? A handful of about five Tory MPs - mostly former ministers - who never supported Brexit and think the failure of politicians to get a deal means Parliament should hand it back to the people. The group includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening. What do they want instead? A so-called People\u0027s Vote. The exact timing still needs to be sorted out but broadly, the group wants the Article 50 process postponed and a second referendum scheduled.This would take about six months from start to finish and they group wants Remain as an option on the ballot paper, probably with Mrs May\u0027s deal as the alternative. There are established pro-Remain campaigns born out of the losing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign from 2016. It is supported by Tony Blair, the Liberal Democrats and assorted pro-EU politicians outside the Tory party. How will they vote? Hard to say for sure. Probably with the Prime Minister if the only other option was no deal.            Anna Soubry is in a small group of unrepentant Remainer Tory MPs who want a second referendum on Brexit The DUP Who are they? The Northern Ireland Party signed up to a \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Conservative Party to prop up the Government.They are Unionist and say Brexit is good but must not carve Northern Ireland out of the Union. How many of them are there? 10. What do they want? A Brexit deal that protects Northern Ireland inside the UK. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister if the deal breaches the red line, with the Prime Minister if she can persuade them it does not. The group currently says No.     The DUP, led in Westminster by Nigel Dodds (right), have a deal with Theresa May but could still vote agianst her Brexit deal Labour LoyalistsWho are they? Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders. How many of them are there? Between 210 and 240 MPs depending on exactly what Mr Corbyn orders them to do. What do they want? Labour policy is to demand a general election and if the Government refuses, \u0027all options are on the table\u0027, including a second referendum.Labour insists it wants a \u0027jobs first Brexit\u0027 that includes a permanent customs union with the EU. It says it is ready to restart negotiations with the EU with a short extension to the Article 50 process.The party has six tests Mrs May\u0027s deal must pass to get Labour votes. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister\u0027s current deal.           Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders are expected to vote against the Prime Minister Labour Rebels Who are they? A mix of MPs totally opposed to Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, some Labour Leave supporters who want a deal and some MPs who think any deal will do at this point. How many of them are there? Up to 45 but possibly no more than 20 MPs.What do they want? An orderly Brexit and to spite Mr Corbyn.How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Other Opposition partiesWho are they? The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents.How many of them are there? About 60 MPs.How will they vote? Mostly against the Prime Minister - though two of the independents are suspended Tories and two are Brexiteer former Labour MPs.      The SNP led by Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents will almost all vote against Theresa May         "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Philip 97 spotted leaving birthday celebrations Prince Charles","story":"    The Duke of Edinburgh was pictured leaving Buckingham Palace celebrations for the 70th birthday of Prince Charles The Duke of Edinburgh was one of the guests to turn out for Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday party last night.The frail 97-year-old - who retired from Royal duties last year - was absent from the Cenotaph service for the first time in 20 years on Sunday, but was able to join well-wishers at Buckingham Palace last night.He was spotted leaving the celebrations in the second sighting of the Duke this week.Prince Philip joined the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as well as Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge at the palace where the Queen paid a touching tribute to her son.She said Charles was a \u0027dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father\u0027.

They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said: \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously.

But once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit’ I can barely remember when this was taken, one of those glam parties at Annabel’s in the late 1980s, when men had to wear black tie and women had to look absolutely scrumptious to get in. That period was a bit of a blur and Annabel’s was just a vortex.From 1973 to 1980, I worked outside Annabel’s, the London club on Berkeley Square. Everyone went there back then: Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, Joan Collins, even Princess Diana. I would stand with Nando the doorman, a great guy with this big moustache, and wait for people to leave. Nando and I used to keep each other company, though he never told me who was in there. He was discreet like that.My nights started at 10.30pm and finished at 2am. I was young enough to handle the hours. I didn’t get inside until the 1980s: it was a big moment and you had to earn your stripes. Once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit. You just had to put your best suit on, smile and blend in. It wasn’t that difficult to approach people. They knew I’d be there and they would be friendly.My big break came in 1975. Liz Taylor was throwing a 50th birthday party for Richard Burton, whom she had just remarried. It was at the Dorchester and I was sent by the Evening Standard to get a picture. Every photographer had been turned away but I hid behind an assistant and slid in through some glass doors.The room was empty except for the DJ. I told him who I was, he handed me some records and showed me how the DJ booth worked, so I could pass unnoticed. Suddenly the room filled up with Richard’s friends, who had all come from Wales. Then the cake got rolled in. I got some pictures of the pair of them blowing out candles and I suppose I got confident, because I followed them to the dancefloor.I never asked if I could take some pictures, I just shot them. Liz turned to me and, in this soft tone, said: “I don’t know who you are – get out.” That was the beginning of a lovely friendship. I sent her the birthday pictures and, after that, she invited me to all sorts of events, from the Chelsea flower show to when she became a dame in 2000.I shot on black and white until the mid-1990s and kept using film until the end of the decade. Most of my early pictures were with a Leica M4. Even after the advent of digital, I continued shooting with Leicas. I preferred what you got and the way they handled: they’re small and unobtrusive, fitting easily into my pocket.It’s difficult doing this job for a long time. Some of my dearest friends have gone: Freddie Mercury, George Harrison, and of course Liz. It’s got to the point where I’m running out of people. My heyday ran from 1970 until 1995. That was when there was money in the industry and people took us seriously – we weren’t out on the streets being paparazzi.The whole industry has changed now. Everyone has a cameraphone and the way celebrities are photographed is intrusive. Today, I only go somewhere if I’m commissioned. Otherwise I stay at home and watch Tottenham on TV. I’d rather become a cab driver than start doing this now. I’ve had breakfast with Nelson Mandela, lunch with the Dalai Lama, but I’d still like to have dinner with Bob Dylan – if only to find out where he gets his suits from.• This photograph will be auctioned for charity at Christie’s on 20 November with other shots from Annabel’s, 1963-2018.

Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d1b56fcc4339f27b72617f6accd06eb40d8a06/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1770979f236c93db54599240b334d987","title":"enemies neighbours ian black review jews arabs palestine israel","story":"In this study Ian Black, the ’s former Middle East editor, explores the origins of this most bitter and intractable conflict from the first Zionist settlements in the 1880s, through the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 – known as the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, to Palestinians – to the Trump era.Black concludes: “There is no sign whatsoever that this conflict is about to end, so understanding it matters more than ever.” His detailed and even-handed account, the result of exhaustive archival research and 40 years of journalistic experience on the ground, is the perfect place to start.• Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017 by Ian Black is published by Penguin.

Hopefully the horse and saddle, too.” A decade later, Harris would recall this advice on a moonless night in western China, as she and her friend Mel Yule were riding – on bicycles, not ponies – towards Tibet. Dressed in black with tape over their reflectors, the pair were attempting to slip through the checkpoint undetected to avoid paying for permits that would subsidise China’s occupation of Tibet. As a guard scanned his torch near their hiding spots, Harris contemplated the prospect of life in a Chinese prison – but he eventually drove off, and Harris and Yule rode like the wind towards the Tibetan Plateau, as “fear exhausted itself into euphoria”.So begins Harris’s debut, Land of Lost Borders, a book Colin Thubron has called “a hymn to the pure love of travel”. That trip in 2006 inspired the pair to launch themselves five years later on a far more epic adventure: a 10-month, 6,000-mile bike ride along the Silk Road, from Turkey to Tibet, then on to India, during which they were sustained at times by little more than instant noodles, instant coffee and the generosity of strangers.Hearing Harris tell it today, she had no choice: right before leaving, she’d quit a PhD programme at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “I’d burned all the bridges that would lead to reasonable careers when I got on my bicycle,” she says down the phone from Whitehorse, in Yukon, Canada. (She lives two hours south, in Atlin – population 450 – in an off-grid log cabin.) “I didn’t have anything to fall back on.”Harris, who describes herself as having “a grudge against borders and a knack for getting lost”, grew up wanting to become an astronaut and travel to Mars, even attending a simulation camp in Utah. But instead of chasing the Red Planet, she set her sights closer to home and studied history of science at Oxford.After working in a laboratory at MIT, however, she realised science wasn’t for her and contacted Yule about returning to Tibet.“We didn’t want to just go on a year-long jaunt,” Harris says. “The first trip had opened up all of these questions, such as, ‘Who do these military checkpoints exist for if they don’t care about us being there? And what are the military convoys doing in western Tibet?” Yule had studied community development, while Harris wrote about border issues for her masters thesis. “Looking at wildlife conservation as it impacted people in the borderlands of the Silk Road – all those places Marco Polo despised and complained about – it seemed like our interests would come together,” she says.As a child in rural Canada, she had read her mother’s illustrated edition of The Travels of Marco Polo and dreamed of seeing the near-mythical network of routes that make up the Silk Road. In Land of Lost Borders, she charts her own journey with wonder and sometimes despair, along with the occasional jab of self-mockery. But the story is more than a travelogue: Harris probes big questions about borders and the paradoxes of exploration, while relating tales of camping in fields and backyards, of being locked in a teahouse overnight in Turkey, of fleeing Azerbaijan by sleeper train hours before their visas expired. The trip, she writes, was an opportunity to study “how borders make and break what is wild in the world, from mountain ranges to people’s minds”.While writing, she revisited the works that had set her on this path: everything from Darwin’s expedition journals to dispatches by pioneering adventurer Alexandra David-Neél, who made her own rogue cycling trip across Tibet in 1924 and whose name Harris chanted as a mantra to get her through one especially difficult stretch. “I write early in the book about David-Neél’s searching for an outer world that was as wild as she felt within,” Harris says.That notion of wildness – her own and that of the world around her – is a motif in the book. “As children, our notions of the world are untarnished,” she explains. “You talk to kids about climate change or plastic in the oceans and their priorities are not yet profit or personal advancement. They care about what’s happening to planet, and they can’t understand why we’re not making dramatic changes to save the world.”For her, the goal of both exploration and literature is to tap into that childlike wonder. “For me, wildness is about preserving that idealistic core, despite everything the world throws at you,” she says. “I guess, too, words are a way to access that – the way a sentence can surprise you into a new way of seeing things. During the trip, the relationship between language and wildness and the world became more intertwined.”There’s a lovely point in the book when Harris reflects on that wildness inside her. What made her, as a child, look at the night sky and dream of a one-way passage to Mars? What drove her to cycle a punishing route along what she terms “civilisation’s oldest superhighway”? Just what is the nature of existence? “It was the truth I was after, the deepest wonder, nothing less,” she writes. “‘The the’, wrote Wallace Stevens in a poem.”So now, all these miles later, what does “the the” mean?“I don’t know, is the first answer,” she says, and pauses. “The essence of it is unsayable – the ineffable mystery that beats and pulses between all we do and all we are. We don’t know the first thing about what we’re doing here, where we came from and where it all began. Whatever the crazy ‘the the’ is, here we are, we’re in it, we’re living it.”• Land of Lost Borders: A Journey on the Silk Road by Kate Harris is published by HarperCollins.

According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year as 1,000 retail business entered administration – ranging from big chains such as Maplin and Poundworld to small independent traders.The John Lewis advert is bookended by the singer performing Your Song at his first piano in what is supposed to be the sitting room of his London home. The two minutes 20 seconds in the middle chart his path from school and pub gigs in the London suburb of Pinner to pop megastardom, complete with technicolour outfit changes that include a stars and stripes sequinned suit and pink mohican.With a little poetic licence the ad traces the singer’s musicianship back to the Christmas gift of a piano in the early 1950s, when the then Reginald Dwight was growing up under the watchful eye of his mother and grandmother. One scene, which re-enacts him nervously playing at a school recital, is expected to bring tears to the eyes of thousands of parents of would-be musicians.“We’ve been doing John Lewis Christmas ads for some time now and what’s on my mind is how we move it on creatively but hold on to the heart of what makes them special,” said Craig Inglis, the customer director at John Lewis \u0026amp Partners. “I hope audiences will watch this and really enjoy the national treasure that is Elton John.”John Lewis, which is part of the employee-owned partnership that also owns Waitrose, has had a tough year with its stores making a loss in the first six months. Some analysts have questioned the logic of pressing on with grandiose brand-building after the annual staff bonus fell to the lowest level in 64 years.Against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence going into Christmas, retailers have taken a more Scrooge-like approach this year with total spending on TV advertising expected to decline by £44m to £1.43bn, according to Advertising AssociationWarc figures. Cash is instead being erted to ads on social media.Struggling rival Marks \u0026amp Spencer has changed direction after last year’s advert, starring Paddington Bear, failed to move the dial on sales. Instead its ad, featuring the TV presenter Holly Willoughby, is designed to shift party outfits and knitwear rather than make Britons feel warm inside.Ellen Hammett, a reporter at Marketing Week, said John Lewis had stuck with the big emotional storytelling that is its calling card but that it felt “more like a biopic of Elton John’s life”. She added:“I liked it, but that’s probably more to do with the fact I like Elton John than anything to do with Christmas or John Lewis. It will be interesting to see how it goes down with the general public.”John Lewis says it blockbuster Christmas ads are an important investment and thus far have been among the “most effective marketing campaigns in the industry”.With a £300m fortune, John – who is on a 300-date retirement tour – can afford to shop in luxury stores, but he professes to be a John Lewis regular, with some Dartington crystal glasses his most recent purchase.The superstar, who has two young sons with his husband, David Furnish, described the ad as “absolutely fantastic”. “The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family. I’ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.”John Lewis’s ads have traditionally reworked a classic tune, and it is the second time Your Song has been used – the 2010 ad used a cover version by Ellie Goulding. But this time we get John singing his first major hit.Other songs featured this year include his Step Into Christmas, which is being used in a series of shorter product-focused ads.The main ad, which airs on ITV at 9.15pm on Thursday, does not rely on product placement. Shoppers will not be able to buy his embroidered silk dressing gown or tinted glasses, but John Lewis is rising to the occasion with a range of pianos. Prices start at £150 for a keyboard but if there is a really promising musician in your family there are upright pianos costing more than £800."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99192dfe826c3ac117beadd1482c8cc366529964/162_375_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c8ee9df3f68049738100f0146f5de48","title":"firms digest draft brexit plan business live","story":"Pound suffers heavy sell-off after Dominic Raab and Esther McVey resign from the cabinet over Theresa May’s Brexit planFears over political instability hit a sale of UK government bonds this morning, with the country’s debt agency forced to accept lower than usual bids, to an extent not seen since 2009 in the depths of the financial crisis.While bids received outstripped the amount on offer by 1.75 times, the makeup of the bids showed the DMO had to accept some unusually low bids to sell the full amount of the bond.The gap between the average yield accepted in a bid by the DMO and the highest stood at 5.1 basis points - the biggest since March 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis.By contrast, the average yield tail for conventional bond auctions over the last 10 years stands at just under 0.6 basis points.Gilt yields plunged along with sterling on Thursday after Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey resigned in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft deal for leaving the European Union.Germany’s BDI industry association has given a gloomy assessment of the current state of play, warning that firms should still prepare for a chaotic Brexit.A hard Brexit would be disastrous. It would put tens of thousands of companies in Europe and hundreds of thousands of employees on both sides of the Channel in big difficulty. While talk of Theresa’s May’s Brexit agreement may rapidly date as the day goes on, here is the reaction from the UK car industry, which has repeatedly argued that thousands of UK jobs would be at risk without frictionless trade in Europe.Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders: For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of ‘no-deal’ and securing a transition period. It is, however, only a first step and business seeks certainty and ambition when it comes to securing a competitive future. Truly frictionless trade is the only way to ensure the industry’s future success, and this should be the objective for all parties as we move into negotiating the permanent UK-EU relationship.What started out as a sea of green across European markets this morning has turned into a sea of red.When traders arrived at their desks this morning, there was a sense of relief after Theresa May survived a crucial cabinet meeting on Thursday with ministers backing her draft Brexit plan.By 10am the sense of relief had evaporated after the resignation of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and fellow cabinet minister Esther McVey.Craig Erlam, analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the “crazy” trading we’re seeing is likely to persist today: It’s been a crazy start to trading already this morning and with the Brexit headlines likely to continue throughout the day, I don’t expect that to change. What was meant to be a day of celebration for Theresa May after she received backing from her cabinet for the Brexit deal could quickly turn into a day of hell. I don’t expect any easing up in sterling volatility today, with the resignations potentially coming thick and fast. If the pound breaks 1.27 against the dollar, things could get very messy indeed. Here’s what happened to the value of the pound against the dollar when Dominic Raab tweeted his resignation at 8.53am:What now for the pound? As Garry White from Charles Stanley points out, ING have a few thoughts:The FTSE 100’s earlier gains have been wiped out after Esther McVey became the second cabinet minister to resign this morning over the draft Brexit agreement.McVey said in her resignation letter: We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal to any deal is better than no deal.Investors have been dealt another blow to confidence this morning, after the latest figures showed UK retail sales fell unexpectedly in OctoberRhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS:Retail sales slowed after a buoyant summer with the mild autumn hitting winter clothes sales. Household goods sales also fell in October following two consecutive months of strong home improvements sales. Consumers chose to purchase goods from many stores’ websites as online sales continued to increase.Neil Wilson from Markets says the drop in the pound is as drastic as it might be, given the circumstances:Investors are feeling edgy now, as they digest the latest Brexit twist and consider it a negative for UK firms as it creates greater uncertainty.But the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 are all firms with a major UK focus:Follow our politics blog for all the latest reaction to Raab’s resignation:Those losses have just widened significantly after news breaks that Dominic Raab has resigned. Backlash starts here?Currency traders are wary this morning, putting the pound under pressure as investors digest the considerable challenges that still lie ahead for Theresa May.There are no wobbles across Europe’s key markets this morning, including the FTSE 100 which is up 37 points.The major business lobby groups have welcomed the news that Theresa May clinched the support of her cabinet, but acknowledged it was a compromise agreement and some key risks remain.Here are some of the key responses:Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBIThis deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the cliff-edge.The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors:We urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement. Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal. Our members will adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but they must be allowed to do this in as smooth and orderly manner as possible. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:Businesses will recognise the huge efforts made by the Prime Minister and across government to reach this milestone. After two and half years of uncertainty, this may be end of the beginning — but not yet the beginning of the end. Our firms need clarity and precision on the specific terms of trade they will face in future, many of which are still to be agreed. The avoidance of sudden or multiple changes to trading conditions is crucial to business investment and confidence.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The pound received a slight boost this morning as traders, firms, politicians and commentators consider what lies ahead after Theresa May gained cabinet backing for her draft Brexit plan.Sterling edged above $1.30 after it became clear the prime minister had averted the threat of a major rebellion - for now at least. It is now roughly flat at $1.2992.Business groups cautiously welcomed the news of cabinet approval for the draft agreement, with the CBI describing it as “a step back from the cliff edge”.However, Michael Hewson from CMC Markets says the pound is likely to face more volatility as events play out:Sterling traders had to endure another turbulent session on Wednesday as Prime Minister Theresa May tried to pull together the various disparate views of her cabinet in trying to sell the agreement with the EU over the thorny issue of the Irish border, as well as the outlines of the future trading relationship.While she was able to achieve what she called collective approval from her cabinet to accept the deal, the gritted teeth consensus could well be tested in the coming days, and appeared to be reflected in her tired demeanour, almost as if to brace for the whirlwind that is about to come her way in the next few days, as various cabinet members come under pressure to resign. The Prime Minister herself could well also find herself subject to a leadership challenge if reports of letters going into the 1922 committee, are anywhere close to being accurate and come to a total of 48. Having cleared this particular hurdle, the deal will now have to go to a special EU summit, later this month, before being put before the House of Commons in early December when the real fun is likely to begin, as the 585-page agreement is put before MP’s to vote on. Stick with us for all the reaction from markets and business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b5182c7c31194ee582c3c551bcf59ccaea7b71/0_39_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57a2d5c820814e932e475f163f50f204","title":"the guardian view on theresa mays deal reset the debate","story":"For too long Brexit has been a matter of conjecture and myth. Now MPs get a glimpse of where Mrs May wants to go for the next two yearsFor years, Eurosceptics complained that EU membership depleted national sovereignty by imposing alien rules without parliament’s consent. That was always a misrepresentation, ignoring the influence that UK politicians and officials exercised in Brussels. But leaving the EU guarantees Britain loses its voice in the room where the rules are written, while still having to implement those rules to gain market access. Brexit engineers the very subordination that was cited as a reason for leaving the club. From what is known of the deal that Theresa May has agreed, it seems the UK will spend at least two years in rule-taking orbit around Brussels. This problem of “vassalage” is not Mrs May’s fault. There was nothing she could have done about an imbalance of power in a negotiation between one country and a continental bloc of 27.During the referendum campaign, Brexiters predicted that continental capitals would yield to pressure from their own exporters, eager to retain access to UK consumers. Pro-leave propagandists never understood the European project. The integrity of the single market and the principle of solidarity between states was more valuable to every member of the union than the bilateral trade with any “third country”. By surrendering its privileges as a member, the UK was never going to “take back control”. On the contrary, Brexit guaranteed that control would bleed away from Westminster, as has been the case since the moment article 50 was triggered.While there is much detail to be absorbed in several hundred pages of a draft withdrawal agreement, covering the two-year transition to an undefined future relationship, the compromises have been visible for months. To satisfy the prime minister’s determination to end free movement of people, the UK has excluded itself from the single market and so opted for an inferior trade relationship with the EU. In deference to the Good Friday agreement and the need for a frictionless Irish border, the UK will be in a “temporary” customs union. But that requires adherence to a common external tariff, which Brexiters see as an unacceptable curtailment of trading sovereignty. An escape clause has been included, the legal enforceability of which will be hotly debated in the coming weeks.Border control has been bought at great cost in every other sphere of control. Satisfying anti-immigration sentiment has trumped economic judgment. Mrs May believes that transaction was explicitly mandated by the referendum result and many MPs agree – perhaps enough to ratify the withdrawal agreement, although the numbers look tight. The government’s capitulation to rebels in a dispute over maximum stakes in fixed-odds betting terminals on Wednesday is a reminder that Mrs May has scant room for legislative manoeuvre. In that instance a cross-party alliance applied sufficient pressure to impose a sensible change of course on the government. There is no reason why the same mechanism should not also be available with a Brexit deal. Before “Brexit” was even a word, Euroscepticism was framed in terms of parliamentary sovereignty. Only in the aftermath of the referendum did anti-Brussels sentiment attach itself to the “will of the people” as a higher authority. That rhetorical shift allowed the prime minister to ignore parliament when defining Brexit priorities. But, 28 months later, it is unclear how Mrs May can justify her proposals on the basis of national will.The referendum result demanded the government negotiate an exit from the EU, but MPs must not allow the prime minister to aggrandise her deal as a sacred extension of that mandate. It is the culmination of a set of political choices built around the Eurosceptic tradition of misrepresenting the European project. While the negotiations have been ongoing, many of those hoary old myths have lingered. The advent of a concrete deal presents an opportunity for a more informed debate. MPs have a duty to measure Mrs May’s text not just in terms of whether it clears the bar of getting Britain out of the EU, but on a fuller test of service to the national interest. That means acknowledging damage that will be done by the prime minister’s plan – and admitting that many of those flaws are intrinsic to the very idea of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ad34ad7cd06de4a805e1e02928bf711701f62b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75cbcf0b1a5ba13dd8e799efa3101a0a","title":"theresa may brexit deal solves nothing polly toynbee","story":"As rumours flew that her Brexiter enemies were calling for her head in no-confidence letters, out she stepped alone. After five gruelling hours convincing her cabinet, a beleaguered prime minister stuck to her friendless deal: sticking is what she does best.Now the arm-twisting, the bribery and the for-the-good-of-the-country cajoling of every last MP begins in earnest. Pinned to the wall, each must finally reveal their true colours some will be principled, some not: Tories must reckon if the future is with Theresa May and her deal, or with Brextremists in their constituencies. Any Labour would-be defector must reckon whether their local party could ever forgive them for voting to keep this government in power.Meanwhile, Brexit mis-selling continues unabated. In her statement on Wednesday evening, May said that her deal would give us back “control of our money, laws and borders”, while protecting business and jobs. None of that is true. Nowhere is there any evidence to be found in the lengthy withdrawal deal.For the foreseeable, we are in a customs union we cannot leave without EU permission and our borders are open to EU citizens. We are paying £39bn, business has no certainty for future investment and as for jobs – well, let’s just cross our fingers and hope. May pretends that some distant sunlit trade deal, hazily sketched, will one day emerge from the political declaration that accompanies the deal. Will it be in two years, 10 years, sometime, never? No one knows.All the devilish dilemmas remain. All the impossibilities are as impossible as they were on referendum day – but now they are solemnly written down on paper. We can’t have frictionless EU trade without a customs union, but that stops us buccaneering the globe for those exclusive deals with Mauritania or wherever else Liam Fox chooses to turn to. Ireland stands where it did: preserving an open border, made possible by the Good Friday agreement, means the UK must stay close to the EU forever. Scotland is righteously rebelling: David Mundell, with his crucial 13 Scottish Tory votes in parliament, will not countenance continued EU rights to fish in our waters Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, protests at Scotland being denied Northern Ireland’s competitive advantage of effectively staying in the single market – a special status the DUP also objects to. Today takes us closer to fracturing the union.Remarkably, the deal has united arch-enemies of remain and leave: the European Research Group, Labour, SNP, DUP and the two Johnson brothers are all roaring the same song: give us back control. Good to hear Jeremy Corbyn at last voice full-throated opposition to the deal in PMQs today. That reminds us how powerful Labour’s voice can be once it seriously joins the Brexit battle. What opposition would not relish this chance to topple the government?Corbyn gave his best Brexit performance so far, with withering mockery of Dominic Raab’s discovery that Dover is rather important for 10,000 trade-bearing lorries a day. He reprised Jo Johnson’s deadly Brexit Exocet comparing the chaos to the Suez crisis, and he denounced May’s false choice between “a botched deal or no deal”. As a taster of what’s to come in the parliamentary vote, the theme is Britain is losing control.This is not the beginning of the end nor the end of the beginning. For those yearning to escape the nightmare of obsessive Brexitology, this will be the never-ending story. If parliament does vote this through, if we do depart on 29 March, then trade talks begin, churning over all the same old turf. The elastic transition will stretch into the far horizon, while the Brexilunatics bay at the moon still claiming a sudden-death clean break would magically solve all problems. If the economy falters, they will blame vassalage to Brussels, while remainers blame Brexit. In the battle for “I told you so”, the defining ide of a generation will never end.If, on the other hand, May fails to scrape a majority, Labour will push for a confidence vote. Such a monumental policy collapse should surely bring down a government and cause a general election? But unless the Tory schism drives them mad (which it might), their MPs will rally round: whatever the fate of their hapless leader, there will be no election. Instead factions will put up every other option – Canada, Norway, Switzerland and no-deal – but none commands a majority.Public patience may be stretched beyond endurance, but at least everyone will know the long-ago referendum promises were, well, let’s say economical with the actualité. What happened to “Take back control?” Yes, David Davis really did promise a Brexit with “the exact same benefits” with “no downside”. Liam Fox really did promise a free trade agreement would be “one of the easiest in history” and John Redwood and Michael Gove both said “the UK holds most of the cards”. In the cold light of day, the actual deal has blown away the fantasies.What then? As every option is beaten to a pulp, polls show people already think asking them is the right solution. Sardonic old Ken Clarke had the best last line today: “I wish the prime minister well in obtaining a majority for some course of action that is in the national interest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12683bb3efa81de44cb68c6418cbe023fcb3c33d/0_162_7278_4367/master/7278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a2c423138424cfbfadd229ec4e220e","title":"coca cola truck christmas sugary drinks","story":"I know it makes sense to give children fewer sugary drinks, but why is it always poor families who miss out on the fun?Holidays are coming, holidays are coming … unless, of course, you live in one of the 14 towns and cities pulled from the annual Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour amid health concerns. The tour sees the famous, bright red Coca-Cola truck arrive in towns as it has appeared in adverts since the early 90s – that is, in enough fairy lights to blind – to vy up free 150ml cans of Coca-Cola, Coke Zero and Diet Coke. It kicked off last week in Glasgow, and will visit 24 neighbourhoods as opposed to last year’s 38, a downsizing of more than a third.The truck has been touring the UK during the festive season since 1995, invited by a combination of local authorities, supermarkets and other landowners. But last year campaigners including Sugar Smart successfully prompted Public Health England to issue a warning to local authorities about the impact of such promotions on diet and tooth decay. As a result, this year’s truck will be stopping at fewer council-owned stops, relying mostly on supermarkets to host. Campaigners have continued to apply pressure, coordinating a letter signed by health organisations highlighting that the majority of the current scheduled stops are in areas where there are more children on average who are overweight. In response, Coca-Cola has committed to handing out only sugar-free drinks to children.It’s impressive work from the campaigners by anyone’s standards. We are in a public health crisis regarding obesity and the prevalence of sugar packed into convenience foods is a significant part of the problem. Few brands are as synonymous with sugar-filled convenience products as the first mainstream soft-drinks creator, Coca-Cola. It makes sense that the company shouldn’t be allowed to promote itself in communities already suffering the consequences of an unfettered food industry pushing nutritionally void food, often cheaply, and even sometimes designed to promote cravings. These are companies who place profit miles ahead of people and they should be given a hard ride.And yet, there is another part of me – the part recalling my first Coke truck visit as a child and meeting Santa – that wonders why it’s always the poor families that have to miss out. It’s no surprise that the areas with above-average prevalence of childhood obesity are also the areas with above-average prevalence of poverty. So will the Christmas fun truck only be for areas where there are more slim (read: wealthier) people who can be trusted to receive a free tiny can of Coke without destroying their health?It reminds me of the obsession we have as a society about how poor people spend their money and what they eat the shame attached to a couple of Turkey Twizzlers that isn’t attached to duck confit, despite the latter being even more calorific. And at Christmas of all times, the one time of year when consuming in excess is sanctioned by society.I’m partial to a Diet Coke. And sometimes I eat convenience foods. Perhaps it reminds me of childhood. Maybe I am conditioned by my working-class background. Or maybe I just feel like it occasionally, in between other options. It’s called choice, and we should all have the same ones – regardless of background. To be clear, I commend the brilliant work of the campaigners stepping in and doing something, even if I’m unsure that targeting a temporary party truck will have the desired result (for that, we need seismic change tackling poverty, health education and corporations running riot). Because although the Coke truck won’t be providing complimentary cheer at supermarket car parks in poorer neighbourhoods, the Coke will still be there. It’ll just be lining the shelves.• Coco Khan is a  columnist and feature writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e5508e04b8a4e83092bae291d3806f51ce9436/0_210_3882_2329/master/3882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7c87507249f93429de4082f748ac0e","title":"dominic raab resignation may brexit plan","story":"Before Theresa May’s crunch Brexit cabinet meeting on Wednesday, a lobby hack asked the prime minister’s spokesman: does the cabinet have full confidence in the prime minister? Usually it’s the other way round – the prime minister is asked whether she has full confidence in an unruly or scatty minister. However, as May’s premiership enters its most difficult days yet, the power to grant or take away confidence lies firmly with her ministers and MPs. And it is becoming increasingly clear that, despite May’s cabinet having signed off her deal, confidence is fading fast.Dominic Raab’s resignation this morning as Brexit secretary is a near-fatal blow to May’s Brexit plan – and to her premiership. Prior to the meeting, No 10 aides privately conceded that, of all the ministers that could resign, it was Raab that they could not afford to lose. Raab helped May keep the show on the road in the aftermath of the Chequers backlash, in which the key Brexiteers David Davis and Boris Johnson quit. A pragmatic Brexiteer, Raab was a crucial hire for No 10, as the choice showed that May’s plan still had appeal to leave voters.Raab’s announcement that he cannot support the proposed deal in good faith means that it will now be even harder for Brexiteer MPs to be swung into voting May’s plan through parliament. The government’s Brexit position was opposed by 11 ministers at cabinet – with 18 supporting it.The lack of enthusiasm for the deal from Brexiteer ministers means few will be willing to get out there and sell it to the public. It’s not hard to see why they would be reluctant to wax lyrical about it on the Andrew Marr sofa. If agreed, the UK pays billions to the EU in a orce bill – something Boris Johnson once suggested Brussels could “go whistle” over. Free trade deals look off the menu for the foreseeable as a result of a UK-wide customs union in the backstop agreement – which the UK could leave only if an independent arbitration panel consisting of five people agreed. As for taking back control, there is a continued role for the European court of justice, at least in the short to medium term.Yet May’s big problem relates not just to those around the decision-making table, but to the parliamentary party at large. As Raab’s resignation demonstrated, the anger in Eurosceptic circles cannot be underestimated, and a confidence vote could finally materialise within days. Up until now, the European Research Group of Brexiteer backbenchers had insisted the problem was with the policy not with the person promoting it. That has changed, and Jacob Rees-Mogg will not rule out submitting a letter of no confidence in the near future. “Theresa May is the problem,” complained a member of the group.Were the magic number of 48 to be reached, more than half of all Conservative MPs would need to say they no longer have confidence in the PM. That is not a given, but there is new thinking among Brexiteers that it could still be worth it, as the fact they could call the vote would be a display of strength. If they can show there are 48 Tory MPs who have no faith in May, it sends a message that there are 48 Tory MPs who will not vote for her deal.This would be uncomfortable for No 10 as it would reveal how the Conservative government is having to rely on Labour votes to get its plan through. Even now, the idea that this deal will pass seems pie in the sky – but the chief whip, Julian Smith, has said it is possible. To make it happen, the suspicion is that the government will need many Labour MPs to make up for losing the support of the DUP and swaths of angry Tories. “Increasingly, I can’t see how they would get it through without a significant number of Labour MPs getting behind it,” remarked one Tory MP.Already May’s allies are trying to buy her time by suggesting she doesn’t need to get her deal through on the first attempt – they argue that it could be voted on a second time once MPs saw the markets go and they came under pressure from businesses and constituents. This fear is what No 10 appears to be relying on to sell the deal to MPs. May will argue to colleagues that, if they don’t back her, they will be responsible for a chaotic no deal that will open the door to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. However, Tory MPs are tired of being lectured by No 10 and trust is at an all-time low. No deal may be something the government is not adequately prepared for, but that doesn’t mean MPs will be pushed into taking what they view as a very bad deal.It follows that May needs to quickly come up with a convincing argument for her deal if she is to get more MPs on side. One argument in its favour – made by the odd Tory MP – is that it actually represents a closely won referendum result quite well: a lot of leave voters wanted freedom of movement to end, and it will one of the remain concerns about Brexit was what it would do to the economy – this arrangement keeps market access, even if it does mean losing influence as part of that.But as this morning’s events have shown, such arguments have been given little airing. Instead the narrative is one of Brexit betrayal. At this rate, May will be lucky to still be in place as prime minister when she wishes to put this deal to a vote next month. Confidence that she can do that – let alone pass it – is fading fast.•Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141ebb6fef0832b84dfff71fff87e3037be70ce0/0_116_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d29c33b1ec49d90541fa3f14068552df","title":"steve bannon oxford union","story":"In recent days, there was a rumour going around the University of Oxford that a major speaker was to be announced at the Oxford Union. When it was revealed on Wednesday morning that the mysterious figure was Steve Bannon, few were surprised. The invitation was a predictably out-of-touch move by an institution that was once renowned for its impactful and passionate debates but is now more commonly visited by professional footballers, comedians on publicity tours and extremists looking for establishment credentials.In his reasoning for the invite, the president of the union, Stephen Horvath, presented the standard, free-speech argument that “it is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions”. The idea being that a group of university students would be able to hold fascism to account through a one-hour debate on a Friday afternoon.But the argument – that we should listen to those on the far right because of the insight they can offer into modern populist politics – does not fly in Bannon’s case.Since his departure as Donald Trump’s chief strategist in 2017, Bannon’s significance has seen a steep decline. His audiences at the Oxford Union and at a BBC Scotland event on Wednesday will be far higher than he has become accustomed to recently: only 38 people attended one of his events in New York earlier this year, and photos of empty rooms quietly listening to Bannon have become commonplace on social media.In the Oxford Union event biography – which is remarkably neutral, for a man who views Tommy Robinson as the “backbone of this country” – his new political project, the Movement, is mentioned. It is described as a group trying to “promote rightwing economic nationalism in Europe ahead of the European parliamentary elections in 2019”. But don’t worry if you haven’t heard of it – it hasn’t amounted to much. Bannon, along with his European coordinator, Mischaël Modrikamen, has been rejected by many of the parties he aims to support. In a joint press conference last month held by the National Rally’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini, the former dismissed Bannon’s offer of help, saying: “Bannon is not European. He is American.” And in August, Alternative for Germany (AfD) – whose leader was also invited to the Oxford Union last month but had to cancel because of “security concerns” that had nothing to do with the mass protest organised against her – also rejected the Movement, saying: “We’re not in America.”So Bannon is no longer significant in US politics, and so far his attempts to gain notoriety in Europe are floundering. So why has the Oxford Union invited him? The answer is saddening and obvious – it’s for the excitement. Leaders of the union are titillated by the idea of having someone like Bannon speak at their institution. His invitation, and the complete denial of its problematic nature, gives an insight into this institution that has provided the starting point for many of our political leaders’ careers. They take joy in turning up week after week decked out in white tie to play at parliamentary politics for a few hours. And their political games have a real-life impact – the Boris Johnson-Michael Gove Tory leadership fight in 2016 came straight from the halls of the Oxford Union.The Bannon invitation is yet another example of an institution that serves no real purpose apart from churning out politicians who care more about the game than its result. Perhaps it has had its day.•Fred Dimbleby is a freelance journalist studying history at Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/066270bb479c8e4f726c215d01d6383832caae86/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fae5fab3959c910641e8236f4db5dd71","title":"theresa may britain mps brexit","story":"In the weeks to come, we will see what a ‘meaningful vote’ is worth – and how much muscle parliament has in the Brexit dealNot just one, but two vital meetings for the future of Britain’s relationship with the European Union took place on Wednesday afternoon in Westminster. The first meeting, generating more noise than news throughout a long day, was of Theresa May’s cabinet. Its importance was self-evident. The second meeting, also hugely significant, went wholly unnoticed. In its own way, though, it was equally crucial.The first meeting first. It has long been obvious that, on Brexit, May uses the free-at-last language of the Tory right while tacking at the last moment towards a deal with the EU. She did this in 2017 on the first withdrawal agreement. She did it in the summer at Chequers. Now she has done it a third time, proposing a deal in which Britain will try to remain economically aligned with the EU while having no say over its rules. A bad deal, it is now confirmed, was always going to be better than no deal. It is difficult to be surprised.Wednesday’s cabinet meeting was a long-planned effort by No 10. Its aim was to bounce other ministers into agreement with the prime minister’s deal. The ministers didn’t get the chance to read the agreement fully. They were given inidual briefings that flattered their self-importance. If the strategy succeeded – and most ministers bought in – it meant the Brexit deal would reach first base in the long process of ratification. It would also have momentum, making it harder to defeat.No 10 has shown some emotional intelligence this week alongside the political ruthlessness. It is easier to talk about resigning than to resign with a real deal on offer that, in all likelihood, all 27 EU member states will endorse. There was lots of talk on Tuesday and through much of Wednesday about who might walk out – almost half the cabinet, some normally sensible people suggested. But in the end?In politics, as in life, reality is different from theory. Human beings think they know about birth and death until the moment when they hold a newborn baby, or in which they contemplate a dead parent. In a similar way, a deal in practice has force that a deal in theory always lacks, especially when it is backed, not trashed, by both the Daily Mail and the Express. Yesterday, as ministers pondered, No 10 put its foot to the floor on the timetable – publication following in hours, a statement by May in the Commons on Thursday, an EU summit to sign off at the end of next week, a Commons vote early in December. Just like the first world war, it would all be sorted by Christmas.Meanwhile, Westminster’s second important meeting was going ahead under the radar. MPs have long been promised a “meaningful vote” on the package that May secured this week. Wednesday’s meeting of the Commons procedure committee will have done much to shape how that will work. At issue is whether parliament will have the tools and the will to take control of the Brexit decision and reshape it in the way the parliamentary numbers suggest is possible and that so many in and beyond Westminster want and expect it to do.Wednesday’s committee meeting under its backbench chair, the Conservative MP for Broxbourne and a leave campaigner, Charles Walker, was a private one. It took place for the limited purpose of agreeing (or not) the final text of a report that is expected to be published on Friday. On the face of it, the report will be tediously technical. But its soulless title, Motions under section 13(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, masks a question of raw political importance.That question is whether, in its meaningful vote, parliament has the muscle to do anything more than approve or reject May’s deal. If May had a working majority, the answer would be pretty obvious – approval. But she doesn’t have a majority, so the outcome isn’t obvious, and the scope of the procedure to be followed is therefore crucial for the many who oppose May’s deal and no-deal alike.Originally, the government tried to argue that the vote should be a “take it or leave it” choice. Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the withdrawal bill scuppered that last year. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, then appeared, in a letter, to revive the original approach last month. Now, as May repeated at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the government’s motion will be amendable. But it is still not clear if amendments will be heard and taken first, as normally happens whether the government approval motion will come first, with amendments only taken in the event of rejection or whether all motions will be taken discretely.Among Britain’s 650 MPs there are groups that want a softer Brexit deal than May has secured, those who want a harder one, those who want no deal at all, those who want a second “people’s vote” referendum on the deal, and those who simply want a general election and a new government. Only a few of these positions can be confident of a majority. So the mechanics and sequencing of how these different interest groups get their chance to pitch for parliamentary backing – if they get that chance at all – are therefore a key factor in the politics of the next four weeks.This is where the procedure committee comes in. If it proposes an expansive timetable and process, in which all options are considered, the government could be in trouble. The Speaker, John Bercow, is said to be determined to ensure that all options, including the people’s vote, get debated and voted on. Bercow is definitely up for a fight with ministers who will try to stop the Commons from trying to bind the government.Even if Bercow gets his way, though, the sequencing of the different motions when they come to the vote, now expected to be around 6 December, will be vital. The people’s vote option’s best chance, for example, would seem to come only after all other options have fallen.If Labour’s general election motion is defeated early on in the process, as is likely, Labour must decide whether to whip its MPs in support of a people’s vote. It might, however, opt for the pro-single market Efta membership motion – known to some as “Norway for now” – that is backed by MPs in all parties (and by David Cameron) and could command a Commons majority. Labour’s crafty veteran chief whip, Nick Brown, will be a key player in all this.Most of the time, parliamentary procedure does not matter much in Britain’s politics. But the sudden arrival of a huge national moment in the shape of the Brexit deal, and the choices it poses, pitches it into the limelight. May’s deal means MPs now have to use Commons procedure to turn all that talk about meaningful votes into something that is, well, meaningful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

What would this mean for the local community? Are universities across the board doing enough to connect with, and improve, their own local areas? In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talked about growing local roots with Professor Mary Stuart, vice-chancellor of Lincoln University, and Professor Linda Drew, vice-chancellor of Ravensbourne University. Stuart won ’s Most Inspiring Leader award this year, for success in turning around what was once a flagging university. The Queen opened Lincoln’s new campus in 1996 – the first city centre campus to have been built in the UK for decades. The city’s leaders wanted the institution to boost the area, but they put up the first building “on spec”, designing it to look like a shopping mall in case it didn’t work out. The university now has around 14,000 students, and a gold ranking for its teaching in the Tef. The institution focused on arts and social sciences when Stuart took over, but now has strong engineering and science departments. It is in the process of setting up a medical school, to supply local hospitals, in collaboration with Nottingham University.Ravensbourne is a specialist digital media and design institution, awarded university status this year. It moved into a striking new campus on the Greenwich peninsula in 2010. North Greenwich has long been a deprived part of London. However, Ravensbourne’s innovative open plan building, which looks more like an advertising agency than a university inside, is well positioned for the industries students want to enter. It is right next door to the 02,  the popular music and entertainment venue that replaced the Millennium Dome. The Greenwich peninsula is also London’s newest digital community, and Tech City, the capital’s fast-growing media and technology hub, is just down the road.What have you done locally that has made you most proud?Stuart describes her whole university as a local regeneration project. “We were established on derelict railway land. It was a city that people said was dying.” She says taxi drivers say you couldn’t find a bite to eat anywhere on a Monday night before the university brought the city to life. Gradually, the institution is transforming Lincoln’s low-skill, low-wage economy. “We are bringing graduate jobs and hope to a part of the country that was being left behind.”Our discussion is happening in Ravensbourne University, and out of the window we can see another tower block that is nearly ready for people to move in. “We’re very new to the area but so is everything else,” Drew comments. She says that after the Millennium Dome was built “there wasn’t much else here”. “The developers decided this was an area for design and the digital, and that’s where we fit in.” She is especially proud of the deal she brokered with the 02 when she arrived: students now do work placements there and the university has a jobs board advertising any part-time work at the centre. She recalls the institution being on call for a Take That tour, with students and staff involved in a flashmob event. “They thronged to that, and I got letters of thanks saying ‘I can’t believe I met Take That!’” she laughs.How catastrophic would the death of a university be locally?Last week the Office for Students Chair, Michael Barber, said the regulator would protect the interests of students but would not bail out a failing university. Drew is angry about the implications of this. “If there is a failure in a hospital, communities feel completely abandoned as a result of those services being withdrawn.” She warns that the full economic and social impact of a university is rarely understood, and local people may not realise how much their university contributed to their services and lives until it has disappeared.Stuart stresses that it is a vice-chancellor’s responsibility to make their institution “sustainable and successful”, but she agrees about the impact of losing one. She says removing a university that is properly embedded in its local community won’t just mean a loss of jobs. Lincoln, for instance, has stepped in to rescue arts projects that the local authority can’t afford to sustain. “If we were to be removed from our community, they would go,” she says.She believes that Barber’s argument is part of a paradigm of universities being about “private goods”, which she says the sector itself “very unfortunately bought into”. “Universities have never just been about the benefits that iniduals get,” she insists. “We’ve got to make sure we hang on to that social purpose. It is absolutely vital. We are there as a public good.”Would it be easier to lose an institution in London?Drew says it would be less easy than it might appear, because universities in London are part of an intricate social ecosystem. Ravensbourne works with the two other higher education institutions in Greenwich, but also with further education colleges, the NHS and community groups. “If you were to remove one part of that ecosystem the rest of it would be bereft – not just less rich, but actually bereft.”How do you draw in locals who think your university isn’t for them?Stuart says that Lincoln is designed as an open campus. There is a walkway from one part of the city to the city centre that goes straight through the campus, and the university runs guided tours. “But there are still people who feel that this is not for them,” she admits.To circumvent this they run a pop-up social science park on a different local housing estate each year. There is a law clinic – which Stuart says is hugely important following government legal aid cuts – and parents can talk to education academics about dealing with their children’s school. Locals are encouraged to pop into the law clinic at the university to follow up. “Doing these things in community settings helps break down barriers in a way that trying to force people to come on to campus wouldn’t,” Stuart says. “Growth in an area is great, but if it’s not inclusive growth, then you create greater disparity, and we all know what that’s done to our world at the moment.”But operating in a capital city on high terrorist alert means that Ravensbourne has to think more about student security. “This is a high security area so we have to be really careful about how we invite people on to the campus,” Drew explains. As a result a lot of their engagement with local people happens elsewhere in the borough. The university does, however, use its digital expertise to pull locals in, offering young and retired people bite-sized skills courses which are highly subsidised by the local authority. “We cover everything from how to manage social media to how to take the perfect Instagram photo,” Drew says.Many Ravensbourne students come from the area in the first place. Like Lincoln, the university tries to make sure there are local jobs available by working with the local authority and other partners. “But because a lot of our graduates are at the innovative end of creativity and technology, many will go into our own incubation hubs and on to accelerators,” she says. “Staying in London is a way of creating a creative identity.”Do we focus too much on economic impact locally?“I’m definitely thinking past the economic,” Drew says. “We are developing skills like resilience and developing a graduate’s role as a citizen. That’s really important here in what was formerly a depressed part of London.”Stuart argues that employers won’t come to a region if there is nothing for their employees outside work, and this is one of the reasons her university is trying to make Lincoln a better place to live.But she adds that the government is still too focused on the big metropolitans. “People in my part of the world are in a ‘great small city’, as the Americans call them, and we don’t recognise those cities properly in this country.” She feels strongly that we don’t know enough about the people living in rural and coastal areas, and universities should be a key part of addressing problems they face, including a lack of employment and opportunity.What do universities need to get better at locally?Stuart is quick to point out that “some universities aren’t as embedded in their communities as they should be.” She argues that every university will have many staff who are doing things locally, such as being a governor of a local school or taking part in community artistic activities. “Senior management often don’t even know about those things, but they need to find out and to value them.” Yet she warns that institutions need a clear civic strategy, or they will end up being pulled in many different directions.Drew’s advice, as a small specialist institution, is that you can’t do much without others. “You need to be meaningfully connected with lots of other bodies in your area,” she says.What was your first degree and where did you study?Fashion design at Saint Martin’s School of Art.What advice would you give your 18-year-old self?Speak your mind, hydrate, moisturise.What book is on your bedside table?The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson.What is your insider tip for people visiting Greenwich?Greenwich has a fantastic naval heritage.

Now the pick-and-mix tin is going to tear us apart…Like it or not, Christmas is bearing down upon us. It’s a special time for over-eating, socially sanctioned inebriation and, most importantly, for realising that your immediate family are a bunch of truly appalling, hateful people. T’was ever thus. When I was a kid, growing up with an agony aunt mother who ran her business salving emotional pain and distress from home, the busiest two weeks of the year were always the ones immediately following Christmas. The break stopped families getting away from each other. Cooped up at home because of the weather, crowds of people would end up writing to my mother announcing they now wished to orce their irritating spouses or put their dreadful children up for adoption or both.It could have been worse. For decades, many British families have learned to sublimate their festering rage over the festive period, through the medium of cheap chocolate: in particular, via arguments over the contents of the shared Christmas Quality Street tin. By fighting with each other over who ate all the orange cremes, and why there are only toffee pennies left and for God’s sake, you know exactly how important the green triangles are to me, generations of us have avoided arguing about anything of real importance. We bitch and squabble over crap confectionery and, satisfied that we have somehow made our point, retreat into a fine British position of quiet, sturdy mutual contempt.Well, brace yourselves. Nestlé, the current custodians of the Quality Street brand, have screwed this up. I would go so far as to say that they have risked ruining Christmas for millions of British households. Quality Street functioned as a pressure valve for family antagonism precisely because you never knew exactly what you would get in the tin. This year, Nestlé has created a pick-and-mix system, hosted within every branch of John Lewis. For a mere £15, you can create your own mix of a minimum of three, and a maximum of nine, of their classics. You want only caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies? (Ludicrous example. Nobody actually wants the toffee pennies. Apart from my wife. She’s weird.) That’s exactly what you can have. They’ll even print your name on the lid.Worst of all, it’s a massive hit. On a Monday lunchtime, weeks out from the festivities, London’s Oxford Street branch was full of people literally queuing up to destroy their own families from the inside. I went. I did it. I was the one who asked for a three-way split between those caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies. I took the tin home. We opened it and were faced by the unhealthiest thing possible: instant gratification. No arguments. No rows. One for me. One for her. One for the youngest. And the stone-cold certainty that without this to fight over, we were going to have to argue about something that actually mattered.There is a bitter irony to it being sold only through dear old John Lewis. The department store is practically regarded as a place of worship for Britain’s godless middle classes a tribe that specifically hates arguments. They want everything to be nice. They would rather pour molten iron on their own feet and stick pins in their eyes than actually say what they really think or feel about each other. And yet, by buying into this latest Quality Street marketing wheeze, this destruction of the traditional way of muddling through, they’re going to end up doing just that. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but Christmas 2018 is utterly buggered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db052d1865e737803d2a79df580289ebf69a13b8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18526b6cce3f18c31fe346a0e2e952cc","title":"nations league and international football 10 things to look out for","story":"Crunch time for Germany, history beckons for Mauritania and an O’Neill derby in DublinGermany staring down the barrel of relegation – did we ever think we’d see the day? That is the ignominious fate that will befall Joachim Löw’s side in the inaugural Nations League if they fail to beat the Netherlands in Gelsenkirchen on Monday. Indeed, their fate will already be sealed by then if the Dutch beat France on Friday, although one suspects Ronald Koeman’s side would prefer to inflict the humiliation in person. With Mesut Özil in self-imposed international exile and Sami Khedira and Jérôme Boateng both dropped, this is a time of transition for Germany. “I don’t want to just dump the 2014 generation,” said Löw. “But it is now time for further changes.” While his country’s federation have not shown any inclination to sack their long-serving manager, whether or not Löw is around to implement those changes is open to question. BGThe expansion of the Africa Cup of Nations to 24 teams always made it likely that next year’s edition would feature some debutants and Madagascar have already made it. Not many people would have tipped Mauritania to do likewise even though the country came close to reaching the last edition, finishing above South Africa in a tough group. They kept faith with manager Corentin Martins after that promising campaign and have carried on their good form. They will confirm their qualification for the finals if they win at home on Sunday to Botswana, whom they have already beaten away. Mauritania are particularly strong at home, where they have already got the better of Burkina Faso and Angola (four days after being thrashed 4-1 in Luanda) so they can be confident of overcoming Botswana so long as they hold their nerve while on the cusp of an historic achievement. Meanwhile, Angola host Burkina Faso on the same day knowing they probably need to win to take the group’s other qualifying spot. PDStraight after his annual Remembrance Day pillorying, James McClean could find himself in the spotlight on Thursday, when the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland meet for a friendly in Dublin. Some fans are expected to take the match as an opportunity to debate Fifa’s eligibility rules and the Good Friday Agreement in a constructive and respectful manner, with the cases of McClean and Shane Duffy cited helpfully whenever one of them touches the ball. But, for different reasons, Martin O’Neill is likely to be under more scrutiny than either of his fellow Derrymen. Over the last year O’Neill’s team have struggled to produce coherent and positive performances, and the manager has attributed much of the blame to his lack of resources. That reason will not hold up if Michael O’Neill sends out a side that does better. PDWhile much of the focus in the build-up to England’s November internationals has centred on Wayne Rooney’s send-off against the USA, the striker will be conspicuous by his absence from the squad preparing for their final Nations League group game against Croatia three days later. Should Spain fail to beat Croatia in Zagreb on Thursday, an England win at Wembley over the team who ended their World Cup dream will seal a place as one of the four Nations League finalists who will duke it out for the trophy next June. It would scarcely constitute revenge for the semi-final heartbreak, but would at least leave England open to further anguish of a significantly more minor and unprecedented kind. BGPerhaps Didier Deschamps’ continued refusal to cap Aymeric Laporte is part of a weird test for the defender to prove how much he wants to play for France and not Spain, for whom he also qualifies? Or maybe his omission from France’s squad for Friday’s Nations League match with the Netherlands and Tuesday’s friendly against Uruguay is a punishment for the Manchester City defender publicly supporting Adrien Rabiot – via a clapping emoji – when the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder threw a strop at being placed on standby when last summer’s World Cup squad was announced? Or maybe, with Samuel Umtiti unavailable, Deschamps genuinely believes it makes more sense to bring back Mamadou Sakho to compete with Presnel Kimpembe for the position alongside Raphaël Varane in the heart of France’s defence? Maybe that is yet more evidence of Deschamps’ basics-first approach it definitely reinforces the world champions’ strength in depth. PDUpon hearing that Sheffield United right-back Kieron Freeman had been called up to replace injured central defender, Chris Mepham, for the Wales squad to face Denmark in the Nations League on Friday, the prevailing mood among the panel on Elis James’s Feast of Football was one of total bafflement. The actor and comedian chews the Welsh football fat with former internationals Iwan Roberts and Danny Gabbidon on the weekly podcast and, with all due respect to Freeman, all three fanatics were bemused by Ryan Giggs’s reluctance to opt for Swansea’s Joe Rodon, an actual centre-back. Even more weirdly, the trio recently revealed Giggs has not attended a Swansea game since the start of the season. One man in the squad is Chris Gunter, who will overtake Neville Southall to become the most capped player in Welsh history if he features against the Danes and then Albania. The 29-year-old may have to wait, as he’s currently behind Connor Roberts – a Swansea defender who has managed to catch Giggs’s eye – in the pecking order. BGNaby Keïta and Jean Michäel Seri barely had time to compete against each other at Anfield on Sunday, with both appearing only as late substitutes for their clubs. They are likely to see a lot more of each other in Conakry this Sunday, when the Liverpool player hopes to lead Guinea to another victory over Seri’s Ivory Coast. Keïta was superb when his country won 3-2 in Abidjan earlier in the campaign, but he goes into this game on the back of a difficult spell, with his Premier League integration hampered by the injury he suffered on his last international mission. A strong 90 minutes could help his country to secure the point they need to guarantee qualification and also be of long-term benefit to Jürgen Klopp who, for once, has not bemoaned a player leaving to represent his country. But it will not be easy for Guinea, as the Ivorians have made a promising start to life under manager Ibrahim Kamara. PDScotland can win promotion from League C with wins in Albania and at home to Israel. It is a task that should not be beyond them, but Scotland being Scotland, it is in their nature to make life difficult for themselves. Alex McLeish has been forced to contend with a slew of withdrawals, meaning that at the time of writing – deep breath – Charlie Mulgrew, Stephen O’Donnell, Kevin McDonald, Craig Gordon, Matt Ritchie, Robert Snodgrass, Jon McLaughlin, Tom Cairney, Stephen Naismith and Leigh Griffiths are all unavailable. McLeish came in for much criticism for not starting Celtic’s James Forrest in the team that lost to Israel. He can ill-afford to omit the winger for the forthcoming matches and with similarly in-form Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser on the opposite flank, Scotland fans have every reason to be upbeat. Their team is just two wins against fairly mediocre opposition from guaranteeing themselves at least a play-off place for Euro 2020. BGGroup G is the tightest Africa Cup of Nations qualifying pool, with all four teams still in the running. Zimbabwe could seal their passage to the finals by drawing in Liberia this weekend, while the other game is a high-stakes derby. The Democratic Republic of Congo beat the Republic of Congo 4-2 in a spectacular 2015 quarter-final but the neighbours have seldom met in qualifying stages, the last time being for the 2002 World Cup – the Leopards (DR Congo) prevailed then, too. They go into the latest meeting with the upper hand again, one point above the team from the other bank of the river that gives the countries their names, thanks notably to a 3-1 home victory when the sides met at the start of the campaign. But Cédric Bakambu, who scored twice in that game, has been ruled out by injury, as have Jonathan Bolongi and Gaël Kakuta. Meanwhile, the Red Devils will make the short trip from Brazzaville to Kinshasa knowing anything less than a victory is likely to result in ending the campaign below their neighbours again. PDBrazil take on Uruguay at the Emirates in London on Friday night, a match both teams are using as part of their preparations for next summer’s Copa América, staged in the home of the Seleção. Since being knocked out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals by Belgium, Brazil have played and won four against the USA, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, conceding no goals. After taking on Uruguay, they face Cameroon on Tuesday. Quite what Neymar and his fellow Samba Boys will make of Milton Keynes’s famous concrete cows is anyone’s guess, but their presence in the satellite town ought to generate no end of excitement among locals who have been starved of Jogo Bonito-style entertainment from MK Dons in recent years.

He was born in Naples, signed for the club aged 15 and has been running up the wing at the Stadio San Paolo for nearly a decade. I put it to the supporters that, if Insigne helped the club go one better than the second-place finish they achieved in Serie A last season and Napoli finally won their third league title, it might be fitting to reward him with a new squad number. The club retired Diego Maradona’s No 10 shirt after he inspired them to two league titles in 1987 and 1990. If anyone deserved the honour of bringing it out of retirement, surely it would be local boy Insigne?The Napoli fans responded with an unequivocal “no”. It was nothing against Insigne, they said, but rather the simple acknowledgment that no one ever will deserve the No 10 shirt because no one will ever be Maradona. Insigne will have to stick with the No 24 – his wife’s birth date.The first shirt number to be retired from professional sport was that of the Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey. While playing in an NHL game against the Boston Bruins in 1933, Bailey was upended and landed headfirst on to the ice, fracturing his skull in the process. His injuries were so severe that doctors worried he might not survive. He pulled through, but never played professional ice hockey again. In response, the Maple Leafs retired Bailey’s No 6 shirt permanently.The practice of retiring squad numbers quickly spread through US sports. The New York Yankees have now retired every single number from one to 10 and they somehow managed to retire their No 8 twice – for Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey.The idea did not catch on in football until much later. For a long time footballers did not have fixed squad numbers and instead wore the shirts 1-11 according to who was picked on the day. It wasn’t until the early 1990s, when shirts began to bear the players’ names as well as numbers, that it became necessary to fix the numbers from one game to the next. Almost as soon as squad numbers were allocated, clubs started to retire them. The frequency with which numbers are retired, and the reasons for it, offer interesting insight into the mentality of different clubs and their fans.It is fairly common for football clubs to retire the No 12 in honour of the fans, the mythical “12th man”. None of the current Premier League clubs have retired the No 12 shirt but sides such as Bristol Rovers, Exeter City, Gillingham, Oxford United, Oldham Athletic, Peterborough, Plymouth Argyle and Portsmouth have gone for the idea. It is more common on continental Europe, where Bayern Munich, Lazio and PSV Eindhoven have gone down that route. As a gesture, it seems a bit condescending to supporters, something that requires neither imagination nor expenditure from the board.A lot of numbers have been retired to show respect to players who have died tragically in their prime. Some, such as Piermario Morosini of Livorno, even did so on the pitch. This gesture acknowledges their irreplaceability: that no one else could step into the place they have vacated so suddenly. Far more intriguing, however, are the numbers retired for players who are either still alive or who died long after their retirement, such as Bobby Moore’s No 6 at West Ham or Javier Zanetti’s No 4 at Internazionale. There is something slightly grandiose about this, as if fans are commending the player to the ages, like a Viking warrior pushed out to sea on a ship with his shield and battle armour.This is nowhere more true than in the case of Paolo Maldini’s No 3 shirt at Milan. When Maldini hung up his boots in 2009, the No 3 he wore for almost the entirety of his career was not completely retired but was instead held until one of Maldini’s sons, Daniel or Christian, could emerge from Milan’s youth system and take it.This romantic, almost fairytale, gesture acknowledges the club’s history – Paolo’s father Cesare had also been a Milan captain – while also nodding to the future. The implication is that only someone from that illustrious Maldini line could be capable of filling that role, heirs to the throne in an almost literal sense. However, with 22-year-old Christian currently playing for Pro Piacenza in the third tier and 17-year-old Daniel still in the Milan academy, it is hard to see that No 3 shirt as anything other than another albatross around the necks of two youngsters who already have an incredible legacy to live up to.The example of Roberto Baggio shows how relative the concept of irreplaceability can be. The beloved trequartista is probably most closely associated with the No 10 shirt of Italy’s national team, but that number was never retired for him. Nor was his shirt at Juventus – where he won the Ballon d’Or and his first Scudetto – or at Milan, where he won his second league title. Instead, his No 10 shirt was retired by Brescia, his final club.This might seem odd. A cynic might think that Brescia, a club whose best ever finish in Serie A was seventh place, were merely trying to wring the last drops of glamour from its association with a player who was really out of their league. A more charitable view would be that Baggio played more league games and scored more goals for Brescia than anywhere bar Juventus and that, freed from the dressing room politics and injuries that blighted his career at bigger clubs, he was able to be truly influential at Brescia, leading the club to that all-time best league finish and an Intertoto Cup final.Baggio was irreplaceable for Brescia in a way that he wasn’t for Inter, Juventus, Milan or Fiorentina. Retiring his squad number was a way of saying “it won’t get better than this” and it’s useless for a side with Brescia’s resources to pretend otherwise. Anyone who saw Baggio’s golazo against Juventus would be inclined to agree.There is something unsatisfying and even anti-sporting about retiring squad numbers. A significant part of sport’s appeal it that it is endlessly renewing itself as soon as you are crowned champions, you need to prepare your title defence because everything is reset to zero when the new season comes around. This is what keeps fans coming back over and over again, hoping that this year will be their year. It is unsurprising, then, that most top clubs have little interest in retiring numbers. To do so would be to suggest that one particular victory was freakish or unusual.The most successful clubs want to convey the idea of endless renewal in the pursuit of excellence. Manchester United are unlikely to retire their iconic No 7 shirt and it’s the same with the No 10 at Juventus. Both clubs take pride in the long list of illustrious players who have worn them, suggesting that those shirts will continue to be worn by the superstars of the future. Similarly, when Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo hang up their boots, it would be surprising if Barcelona or Real Madrid retired their numbers. They will look to other players in the expectation that they too will enjoy outstanding careers.Contrast this with how Napoli feel about Maradona. He is worshipped like a saint in Naples, where his image is blazoned on walls across the city. Fans regard Maradona as irreplaceable and his achievements as little short of miraculous. However, by linking their only period of success so strongly to one man, they betray the fear that there will never be another league title. If Napoli wish to win a third Scudetto, they may need to overcome these hang-ups and adopt the mentality of their hated rivals, Juventus, who view success as both a right and an obligation rather than a miracle.In the meantime, Insigne could do worse than consider the words of one Napoli fan, who told me: “Instead of thinking about the No 10, Insigne should concentrate on making them retire the No 24.” If he and this Napoli side can win that title, the club might do just do it.• This article first appeared on The Gentleman Ultra• Follow Ricci Potts and The Gentleman Ultra on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd99b7a8bce670832d759f862cfbc900a5b1a24/0_0_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e95fb5c5e016d844b0d273c870e4e6","title":"world bank pulls 300m tanzania loan over pregnant schoolgirl ban","story":"Policy that denies schooling to young mothers cited among key reasons for withdrawing education fund The World Bank has withdrawn a $300m (£232m) loan to Tanzania amid concerns about the nation’s policy of expelling pregnant girls from school.The money, a significant proportion of funding totalling $500m awarded to Tanzania by the bank in 2018, was scheduled for approval last month. It was intended to help Tanzania’s education ministry to improve access to secondary education.In a double blow for the country, the World Bank announcement came on the same day that Denmark, Tanzania’s second biggest donor, said it was withholding $10m of aid funding due to unease over human rights abuses and “unacceptable homophobic comments” by a government official.Tanzanian schools routinely expel girls who become pregnant, who are thought to number about 8,000 a year. The practice dates back several decades but has intensified since President John Magufuli took office in 2015. Some schools have imposed compulsory pregnancy tests on girls.The president went a step further in June, announcing that students would not be allowed to return to school after giving birth.In January, campaigners condemned the arrest of five pregnant pupils in the Tandahimba district, on the Mozambique border, saying that the men who impregnated them should be arrested instead.A source within the World Bank told the  that the government’s policy of expelling pregnant girls was among the reasons for the loan withdrawal.In an official statement, a bank spokesman said: “The World Bank supports policies that encourage girls’ education and make it possible for young girls to study in schools until they reach their full potential. The economic and social returns for girls finishing their education are very high in every society for both current and future generations.“Working with our partners, the World Bank will continue to advocate girls’ access to education through our dialogue with the Tanzanian government.”In 2017, a Human Rights Watch report concluded that the discriminatory policy contributed to 1.5 million children being out of school in the country.The source said other factors in the bank’s decision to withdraw the loan included misgivings over a new law, approved in September, that would make it a crime to question official statistics. Last month, the World Bank said it was “deeply concerned” about the amendment to the statistics law – which would impose a fine, at least three years in jail, or both – on those who questioned the accuracy of government figures.In addition, the World Bank has suspended all visiting missions to Tanzania, because of “threats, harassment and discrimination against the LGBT community”. Visits would not resume “until we can secure the safety and security of all employees”, the source said.Ulla Tornaes, Denmark’s minister for development cooperation, expressed similar concerns following the withdrawal of 65m Danish crowns of aid funding (£7.7). “I am very worried about the negative development in Tanzania, the latest being the completely unacceptable homophobic statements from a commissioner,” Tornaes wrote on Twitter.A spokesperson for the minister later confirmed that Tornaes was alluding to remarks made by Paul Makonda, the administrative chief of Dar Es Salaam, who earlier this month ordered people in the city to report anyone suspected of being gay.Judy Gitau, the regional coordinator for Equality Now Africa, an advocacy group that has been lobbying to have school expulsions lifted, said: “Unfortunately, the taking away of $300m means all children will suffer. However, it is in the government’s hands to right the wrong, to lift the ban and to ensure the money does come in.“Most of the young girls who get pregnant come from a background of poverty. The implication of the ban is to deny these girls a basic education and relegate them to a cycle of poverty. The system endorses the view that girls are not as worthy as boys.”Tanzania has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the world, with widespread sexual violence and girls exchanging sex for school fees, food and shelter, according to the UN.Last December, Magufuli pardoned two child rapists who raped 10 primary school children, after serving 13 years of their life sentences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b33dbd4c89be6155fba4d37902f403bada9908/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bfb66b946663f74626c37dc196d104c","title":"why theres no such thing as a perfect vegan","story":"Almost everything we eat involves some kind of animal suffering – but we can do our best to minimise itEight years on, veganism still has me scratching my head. My commitment hasn’t wavered, but the questions surrounding what is and isn’t vegan continue to plague me on a weekly (and sometimes daily) basis. While many assume veganism is strictly about refusing to use animal products, for most vegans it is also about living a life that excludes all forms of animal exploitation. And with mainstream veganism firmly on the rise, the questions keep coming as we learn more about the agricultural price-tags of our choices. Of course, each new discovery is greeted with delight by many non-vegans, who revel in the notion that we’ve been caught out. There is now even a website dedicated to almonds not being vegan (more on this later).As recently as last week, my “nearly vegan” mother passed on a concerned message from a close friend who felt it imperative that I know almonds (yep, them again) are emphatically not vegan. Cease the almond consumption immediately (that is, if they come from California). Oh, and don’t forget avocados too – particularly if they’re of the Mexican variety. Add dates to the list while you’re at it … and what’s the deal with figs again?It’s not just non-vegans who want to catch us out. My brief foray into vegan chatrooms quickly made it clear that there was a competitive side to the vegan community. The dos and don’ts quickly morphed into intense question marks over who was living their best vegan life.If some hapless newbie admitted they accidentally consumed something that contained the smallest amount of dairy they would be hauled over the hot coals into plant-based purgatory. (Even Peta fell foul of this tendency when it tweeted that Oreo biscuits are vegan, sparking a row over whether they can contain traces of milk.) It wasn’t the best introduction to the lifestyle, and so I left. Not veganism, the chat room.As a result, perhaps the biggest question remained unanswered: is there such thing as the perfect vegan? Or do we need to stop thinking about it in absolutes? “Nobody can be a perfect vegan, as we live in a very non-vegan world,” says the YouTube sensation Madeleine Olivia. “There are many things that are beyond our control. I don’t eat or buy animal products however, I will purchase secondhand wool and eat foods that say ‘may contain’ on the label. I think it’s totally up to the inidual to decide on their own version of veganism and to not be strict with themselves to the point of it becoming stressful.” She says that what matters most with veganism is “doing your best to avoid animal products and animal cruelty”.Ward M Clark, the author of Misplaced Compassion: the Animal Rights Movement Exposed, wrote in an online essay that “every potato, every stick of celery, every cup of rice, and every carrot has a blood trail leading from field to plate”.In the same piece, he claimed that even soybean production (at least in the US) left untold death in its wake: “Pheasants and rabbits are routinely killed in planting and harvesting, and rodents are killed by the thousands using traps and pesticides at every step, production, storage and transportation.”Derek Sarno, the co-founder of the hugely popular Wicked Kitchen range at Tesco, has a refreshingly pragmatic approach to veganism that speaks to the message at the core of the movement. “I believe in the aspiration of the word veganism,” he says. “I live what I would call more like ‘compassionism’, or at least I try to practise compassion when I can, as much as I can, given the tools and experiences that I have acquired. I’m not perfect. I do my best and I make mistakes. It’s easy for me to cook plant-centred foods it’s not so easy to tick every single box out there, so we focus on what we can change right now and work towards what we can influence in the bigger picture.”Some might call my own style akin to “sufficientarianism”: mine is maybe not the type of veganism that ticks every ethical box, but I take on board the complexities of living in the modern world. Veganuary is a charity set up to encourage people to try dropping animal products and its CEO, Simon Winch, says its “philosophy is that it’s about doing your best, and not losing sleep over it”. He says: “If you’re doing what you reasonably can to not consume animal products, then eating something which turns out to have an obscure non-vegan E number in it isn’t really the end of the world.”Is it time, then, that we stopped thinking in absolutes? Is some flexibility allowed as we continue to piece together the facts surrounding our food and its origins? According to the Vegan Society, veganism is something that “seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose”.Unfortunately, in modern society it isn’t “possible” or “practicable” (according to the Vegan Society) to know the history of each and every piece of fruit and veg we purchase. Maybe some leeway should be afforded, taking into account the complexities of our multifaceted modern food chain. If you’re happy being a perfectly imperfect vegan like myself, and adapting as you go, knowing that you may fall short some of the time, then you’ll probably find some middle ground that satisfies your drive to do less harm without it affecting your every waking moment.

Here are some of the points that may cause problems for the prime minister, Theresa May, in parliament:The draft Brexit agreement says both parties will “use their best endeavours” to have a future trade agreement concluded six months before the end of the transition period in December 2020, but that if this is not the case the EU and the UK could “jointly extend the transition period” for an unspecified period.Otherwise the backstop solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland aimed at preventing a hard border would come into force. The backstop, consisting of “a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom”, will apply from the end of the transition period “unless and until ... a subsequent agreement becomes applicable”.The single customs territory would cover all goods except fishery products, the agreement says, and will “include the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK”.There would necessarily be extra non-customs checks on some types of goods passing between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, which will not please the Democratic Unionist party who have consistently opposed any kind of differential treatment for Northern Ireland.On exiting the backstop, the agreement says that if “either side considers the the backstop is no longer necessary, it can notify the other” setting out its reasons. A joint committee must then meet within six months, and both sides must agree jointly to end the backstop.This part of the agreement would be difficult for Brexiters to swallow. They have consistently argued that Britain must be able to exit any all-UK customs union as and when it wants to be able to pursue free-trade deals around the world.The agreement says that under the backstop arrangement the UK must observe “level playing field” commitments on competition and state aid, as well as employment and environment standards and tax. These measures are intended to ensure that UK businesses are not able to undercut EU industry.Brussels has demanded “dynamic alignment” on state aid, which would oblige the UK parliament to simply cut and paste EU regulations as they are issued. Britain must also transfer three EU tax directives into law – on the exchange of tax information, reporting on investment firms and the EU’s code of conduct on taxation.“Non-regression clauses” will also prevent the UK from bringing in lower standards on social, environmental and labour regulations such as working hours.Many of these requirements would also be anathema to Conservative Brexiters, for whom leaving the EU represented an opportunity to head towards a low-tax, light-regulation economy such as that seen in Singapore.This issue may be even more depressing for Brexiters. The future UK-EU relationship, which both sides have said requires much more work but aims to achieve a close relationship on services (including financial services) and investment as well as sectoral cooperation in, for example, transport, would “build on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement”.The EU has repeatedly said that it would only allow British seafood exporters tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets in exchange for a reciprocal agreement that EU fishing fleets can continue to operate in British waters.This potentially explosive issue appears to have been kicked down the road: the withdrawal agreement essentially says only that the EU would apply tariffs on fish until a separate agreement was struck on access to EU fishing in UK waters.After the transition period ends, the final withdrawal agreement would be policed by a structure based on a joint committee taking decisions by mutual consent and whose verdicts would be binding.A five-member arbitration panel would be convened to manage disputes. Any issue relating to EU law, however, cannot be decided by the arbitration panel but must go before the European court of justice. That, too, would annoy Brexiters wanting to “take back control of our laws”.In another potentially controversial clause, the draft agreement gives London’s financial centre only a basic level of access to the EU’s markets similar to that enjoyed by US and Japanese firms. It would be based on the EU’s existing system of financial market access known as equivalence – a watered-down relationship that Brussels has said all along was the best arrangement that Britain can expect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/312fb1993edbb6fbaf916c21ea811cf94a05a1ca/0_0_3006_1803/master/3006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82e41c94d5bf7e545c05ed6cac4239f4","title":"theresa mays brexit deal everything you need to know","story":"What does the agreement say? Which bits are controversial? And will it now get through parliament?Two and a half years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the UK cabinet on Wednesday night backed the text of the draft withdrawal agreement drawn up by British and European negotiators – but with a series of ministerial resignations already on Thursday, the fallout has already begun.Here is a non-exhaustive guide to what the agreement broadly says, which parts of it are proving controversial (and why), how likely the prime minister now is to get it through parliament, and what could happen next.Think of it as the separation agreement between the UK and the EU. Running to 585 pages, it covers three main areas:The agreement also includes a much sketchier (and non-binding) seven-page political declaration outlining the two sides’ ambitions for their desired future trading relationship, on which negotiations have yet formally to start.While some of the detail took longer, the UK and EU agreed reasonably quickly on the so-called orce bill and citizens’ rights.The sticking point was the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which after Brexit will also become the border between the UK and the EU. Because of the island’s troubled history, both sides want to avoid a hard border with customs checks that could become a source of friction.The problem has been that, because the prime minister promised in January 2017 to take Britain out of both the EU’s single market (so as not to be an EU “rule-taker”) and the customs union (to allow it to strike its own trade deals around the world), customs and regulatory checks became almost inevitable.The EU’s single market is more than a free-trade area. It aims to remove not just the fiscal barriers to trade (tariffs) but the physical and technical barriers (borders and ergent product standards) too by allowing as free movement as possible of goods, capital, services and people. In essence, it is about treating the EU as a single trading territory.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The European Union is a customs union. It allows free trade between countries inside it and allows imports in to the area by setting common tariffs. The area does not just include EU members. For instance, Turkey is part of the customs union for manufactured goods but not services or agriculture. The single market involves deeper integration of free movement of people, goods, services and money. This means laws need to be aligned. Some countries have access to the single market without being members of the EU’s customs union.Ultimately, the Irish border is supposed to become a non-issue under the terms of the comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) that the two sides are due to sign at some stage after Britain’s departure from the bloc on 29 March next year.But because this may well not be negotiated by the end of the transition period in December 2020, the EU insisted on a “backstop” arrangement to avoid a hard border until a FTA came into effect. The row over the form this backstop should take is what prevented the withdrawal agreement from being sealed for so long.For months, Britain rejected the EU’s proposed backstop – in effect, keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market – because it would mean a customs border down the Irish Sea and other arrangements meaning Northern Ireland was treated differently to the rest of the UK.But the EU also rejected Britain’s suggestion that the whole of the UK should stay in a de facto customs union with the EU, mainly because the government wanted to be able to withdraw from such an arrangement unilaterally and at a time of its choosing (which, for the EU, meant it could not be considered a proper backstop).The solution involved concessions on both sides. For the EU, the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accepted the idea of a whole-UK customs union with the EU, satisfying the UK’s demands that its territorial integrity must be preserved.But in return, Britain must accept that it will not be allowed to exit the backstop “unless and until” the EU agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border. It must also accept special “deeper” customs arrangements, closer to the single market, for Northern Ireland, and the EU’s so-called “level playing field” conditions for the whole of the UK.These address member states’ concerns that de facto customs union membership without the obligations of the single market could give the UK an unfair advantage, so will require Britain to abide by EU rules on, for example, state aid, competition, the environment, tax and labour conditions.Hardly. Conservative Brexiters, as is plain from Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab’s resignation letter, are appalled at the prospect of Britain potentially being “trapped” forever in a customs union with the EU – and at being forced to continue accepting EU regulations to boot.The Northern Ireland unionists of the DUP – on whose votes in Westminster the government’s majority depends – appear to think those “deeper” customs arrangements, involving additional checks on livestock and food crossing the Irish Sea, breach their red lines on identical treatment for Northern Ireland.For its part, Labour has said the agreement looks unlikely to support jobs and the economy or guarantee standards and protections, and it is therefore preparing to vote against it. More Tory remainers – heartened by Jo Johnson’s resignation last week – may also be encouraged to rebel.The EU has confirmed an emergency EU summit can be called for 25 November to seal the deal, although events in the UK may intervene. Complicating the question, some EU member states feel the deal makes too many concessions to the UK.In principle, the deal then has to pass through parliament early in December.Many think it could fall at this hurdle, resulting either in a challenge to May’s leadership, a general election or even a second referendum (with staying in the EU still theoretically an option, although that would mean extending article 50, which set the deadline for the UK to leave as 29 March 2019).But even if May and her deal survive, which appears increasingly unlikely, the agreement stipulates that the government must decide before June 2020 whether it wants to extend the transition period, fall into the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement or enter a permanent customs union – all options that would be anathema to Brexiters.After that, of course, it has to seal the future trade deal, on which the two sides remain far apart.Britain’s Brexit battle is a long way – a very long way – from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d6df22aedb007eee05e7aa2c55ea87c8518744/217_94_2049_1229/master/2049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea0e04ab3db44345c3bb4d1113695766","title":"dominic raab karate blackbelt knockout blow brexit may","story":"Former lawyer was seen as a reassurance to pro-Brexit MPs – making his departure all the more damaging for the PMWhen David Davis quit as Brexit secretary in July over Theresa May’s Chequers proposals, Dominic Raab seemed the ideal instant replacement – an experienced junior minister who, crucially, was viewed by Conservative Brexiters as very much one of them.The former corporate lawyer had long been a proponent for exiting the EU and his presence helming the negotiations in Brussels was seen as a reassurance to anxious Tory MPs – which in turn makes his sudden loss all the more damaging for the PM.The MP for Esher and Walton since 2010, Raab was reportedly viewed in Brussels as someone with an energetic approach – a contrast to Davis’s relaxed, almost laissez-faire approach to the talks.He was also diligent in trying to keep Tory leavers onside, staying loyal to May, until he concluded that he “cannot in good conscience” back a plan which, he said, threatened the union and tied the UK too closely to EU rules.Raab, 44, is the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who came to the UK to escape the Nazis. He studied law at Oxford University and took a master’s degree at Cambridge, before joining the law firm Linklaters.He later worked as one of the principal Palestinian negotiators of the Oslo peace accords before joining the Foreign Office, where he covered a range of briefs including the European Union and bringing war criminals to trial in The Hague.He then switched to politics, working initially as an aide to Davis, whom he would later replace, before doing the same for a Tory MP on the opposite side of the Brexit spectrum, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve.Fiercely ambitious when he entered parliament, Raab had to wait five years to become a junior minister, spending three years at the justice ministry before becoming housing minister, the role from which May plucked him into the cabinet.Before becoming a minister, Raab had regularly challenged May, the then home secretary, over civil liberties and espousing some of his more libertarian views on regulation.In a pamphlet for the Centre for Policy Studies in 2011, he suggested abolishing the working time directive and ensuring workers employed by small businesses did not benefit from flexible working rights or pension auto-enrolment.He was also caught up in a sexism row after he suggested feminists were “obnoxious bigots” and men were getting such a “raw deal” that it was time they “started burning their briefs”. His assertion drew a stinging rebuke from May, who suggested it was “not the way forward”.Some had suggested the disagreement was the reason why Raab took longer to reach the cabinet than some – including himself – thought should be the case.Raab, a black belt in karate, encountered some embarrassment in April when his then diary secretary complained to an undercover reporter from the Daily Mirror that he was difficult to work with and had “tunnel vision”.She said: “I’m not his biggest fan. You have to be very straight with him. He finds it difficult dealing with women. He’s very dismissive.” She also revealed that Raab had the same sandwich from Pret a Manger every day, which he has denied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e0a35dd6fadc8bf88e983f7f2d8b42f5485609/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2111db3a3849632d7d2cd7c93d4f870f","title":"may has no credibility left readers on the brexit deal","story":"Readers are discussing cabinet resignations and the prime minister’s statement in the CommonsMay, along with her plan, is dead in the water. The proposed agreement (should we now call it the “Draft Disagreement”?) seems unlikely to get through parliament and she now has no credibility left. Brexit, always an impossible fantasy, is unravelling. Surely this whole charade needs to be given a quiet burial and Article 50 rescinded so that we can move on to rebuilding our links with the EU as a fully-engaged member? CaroleB999It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whole decision should be passed back to the electorate. The argument from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg etc that “democracy has spoken” does not hold true. In June 2016 the people of this country were asked to sign a blank cheque after a campaign of lies and myths, “easy trade deals, 350 million for the NHS”. It has been proven over the past two wasted years Brexit is creating a crisis not seen since Suez and the second world war. Brexiteers are running scared of another vote, many young adults now have the vote, it is their future that is being played with. I should add I am 68 years old and a staunch remainer: the EU is not perfect but the alternative is much, much worse. kimorrisYou know what’s tragically hilarious about all of this? One of the reasons people want to leave the EU is because they believe the UK can negotiate stronger trade deals with the wider world than the EU can manage. How’s that looking, Leavers? We couldn’t even negotiate the orce settlement like professionals. Keith TaylorNo Deal looking very likely now. Bad times ahead, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The rich among us will feed like vultures on the financial chaos that ensues. Every food, health and welfare standard will get binned to obtain bad trade deals. The NHS will be sold piecemeal to American companies in order to facilitate trade deal too. It’s going to be a mess that’ll take us 20 years to recover from – if we ever do. NTDRaab, like Davis and Johnson before him, is running off the stage so he doesn’t have to confront the consequences of his outrageous lies. Easiest deal in history? We hold all the cards? This was supposed to be a glorious national liberation. Instead, we’re being humiliated and reduced. Or is that still ‘Project Fear’? UltralightbeamThis is the inevitable consequence of having a rational person as PM. She knew from the start that the Brexiter’s unicorns could not be delivered without trashing the economy. In retrospect it would have been better to have had Andrea Leadsom as PM and a cabinet full of true believers. Then they would not be able to hide behind May and pretend that they could have done a better job. I think a general election is on its way. SowesterHard to know what Corbyn is pitching. Is he suggesting we should go into a general election, where Labour will sweep to power on the promise of more extensions and transitions while Corbyn has his own pop at unpicking freedom of movement from the “four freedoms”, like a sword from a stone, so that the “six tests” are met? KlaatuI have now found a paragraph about Northern Irish citizenship. They are being allowed to have EU privileges we are not? That must be wrong. Nothing about the rest of us having our EU citizenship arbitrarily confiscated against our will. I am writing to our MP about that. Some time ago I wrote to Verhofstadt and he was sympathetic, saying he hoped to table a motion for us Europhiles to keep some form of EU citizenship but I have heard no more. The whole Brexit thing is gross insult to remain supporters (over half the electorate now it seems) and surely of questionable legality, or if not, most certainly morally unacceptable. weightheevidenceTwo years ago Britain walked out on a long marriage to the EU. The EU just didn’t understand Britain. Free at last, Britain would hook up with younger fitter models around the world. Yesterday Britain got shown into the new bedsit. On the bed was a box with lawyer’s bills, a maintenance agreement and an unfavourable custody arrangement. sanjeevaGo back and think again seems like the only rational idea at this point. What do the British people want? To jump right out, to maintain connection, or stay in? If the combined numbers of jump and connect are more than remain, let this miserable process continue. If Remain outnumbers both of those, we can draw a line under the past two years and everyone can get on with their lives. We’re all far more aware of how connected to Europe we are on security, science, manufacturing, the NHS, food production etc etc etc. Now is the time for the check and balance of a People’s Vote. tickyt"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3597435984bc65f4ed6b7fe17686f1d6c1bdf9e8/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691c178dbb049e86741ae9a48e2c1977","title":"brexit deal theresa may takes agreement to parliament politics live","story":"May addresses MPs amid resignations following cabinet’s decision to support draft version of Brexit dealBob Neill, a Conservative, says MPs who vote against May’s deal should carefully consider the impact that that would have on their constituencies.Labour’s Chris Bryant says there is no majority for May’s plan in the Commons.

It would have melted vast amounts of ice, sending freshwater rushing into the oceans, and blasted rocky debris high into the atmosphere.At 19.3 miles wide, the crater ranks among the 25 largest known on Earth and is the first to be found beneath an ice sheet.“You have to go back 40 million years to find a crater of the same size, so this is a rare, rare occurrence in Earth’s history,” said Kurt Kjær, of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.Scientists first suspected a crater in 2015 when they spotted a huge depression in Nasa radar images of the bedrock beneath the Hiawatha glacier in north-west Greenland. Kjær, who passes a 20-tonne meteorite to reach his office every day, wondered if such a space rock might be the culprit. “It all snowballed from there,” said Joseph MacGregor, a senior scientist on the team at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.It so happened that researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany were about to test a powerful new ice-penetrating radar system that was operated from the air. In May 2016 the scientists flew over the Hiawatha glacier and used the radar to map the underlying rock in unparalleled detail.The images revealed all the hallmarks of an impact crater. “It became very clear that this was a circular feature with a rim around it and an elevated central region,” said Kjær. The basin itself was more than 300 metres deep, according to a report in the journal Science Advances.To search for solid proof of an impact, the researchers flew out to the glacier and collected sediments that had washed from the crater on to a nearby floodplain. Among the gathered grains, the scientists found particles of shocked quartz and other materials that are typically produced by the violence of a extraterrestrial impact. Geochemical tests of the grains suggest the meteorite was made of iron.So far it has been impossible to put a firm age on the crater, but its condition suggests it formed after ice began to cover Greenland about 3 million years ago. But the crater may have formed much more recently. The radar images show that while the surface layers of the glacier immediately above the crater look normal, deeper layers that are older than 12,000 years are badly deformed and strewn with rocks, with some lumps as big as trucks.“When it happened is the $64,000 question,” said MacGregor. For a final answer, the researchers will need to drill through half a mile of ice and collect crater material for dating, or wait for rocks from the impact basin to be brought to the surface as the glacier flows to the sea. Either way, the scientists have a wait on their hands.“We live on a planet where you can survey anything and you think you know everything,” said Kjær. “But when you see such a big thing as this hiding in plain sight, you realise that the age of discovery is not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae539963b40bf181b704546887c7bdac96b17e42/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce047803cc94e0e338c30d5820fc0d9c 2020w","title":"the lazy zombies guide to youth a radio course with the power to change lives","story":"A new course from ŠKODA is giving young adults a chance to explore their creativity, voice their feelings and expand their skillsOnce home to countless giants of broadcasting, Manchester’s Granada Studios is now a training ground for a new generation. Though the telly sets are long gone, it remains the home of Reform Radio, an online station that also acts as an incubator for young people interested in a career on the airwaves.And if getting ahead in creative industries means subverting expectations, it’s clear the latest batch of students are off to a good start. Huddled around mixing desks and microphones, the show they’re workshopping is called The Lazy Zombies’ Guide to Youth – a sardonic riff on the perceived lack of motivation and creative energy often attributed to the digital generation.They arrived on Monday with little to no relevant experience by the end of the week they’ll produce and present the show to a gathered audience of friends and family. A project from ŠKODA in partnership with The Prince’s Trust as part of the former’s Driver’s Seat Initiative – which aims to celebrate independently minded people who want to make a positive difference to the world – it’s open to 16-25-year-olds who are not in education or employment. That’s a fairly broad window of eligibility, so what drives participants to get involved?For Rhys Forteau, 19, it’s about generating a creative spark. “I think that doing something creative helps you understand yourself a bit better – you find new sides to yourself, and that gives you more motivation,” he says. “My mum wanted me to be a care assistant. I did a bit of training and I enjoyed it at first, but it’s not something I could see myself doing in five years’ time. This course has shown me I can make my own opportunities, not just follow in others’ footsteps.”Along with independent thought, another trait in no short supply among the group is tenacity. Jacob Bowen and Sophie Heng-Travis, both 24, have worked in a number of jobs since graduating with qualifications in creative fields, though both feel they have yet to realise their full potential. For them, the course is an opportunity to widen their skillsets and meet similarly ambitious people.“For me it’s about building my toolkit,” says theatre graduate Bowen. “It’s alright doing filler jobs for a while, but I graduated three years ago. It gets a bit tedious.”Writer and poet Heng-Travis agrees, and suggests it’s a lack of persistence that leads to a lot of young people falling short of achieving their dreams. “I think for some people our age, it’s sad that you have to settle and just do something that’s not what you want to do. But you have to make money and be part of the system, which can mean doing something that’s mediocre. That’s what I find frustrating. But you’ve got to be persistent, you’ve got to keep going.”Course tutor Adam Seymour has not only seen the effect the course has had on countless young people – he’s also a living, breathing testament to the power of training to change lives. He took a similar course himself as a student two years ago, at a time when mental health issues had been holding him back. “I didn’t have a lot of confidence in my own abilities,” says Seymour. “I needed a bit of a boost, a safe space, I needed people around me who were in the same boat, because sometimes when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression and other wellbeing issues, it’s hard to reach out to people.”Seymour’s experience suggests it’s not simply inidual qualities, but rather a joint mentality of determination, and a willingness to collaborate, that’s the key to making the most of a course like this. Bowen agrees: “Having a platform where we can use that fire in our belly, from all the things that are going on with today’s youth, is massively, massively important. It’s about getting together with a few different people from different backgrounds, being on a level playing field and having something to say.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe65b87703bc20d82471bd0973fbb747ddce33b/424_137_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a5d6d90abb53b06b0c38d325c1d324","title":"why young creatives are choosing theatre over digital mediums","story":"Theatre may not seem like the natural medium of young people, but a creative course from ŠKODA is finding that plenty of aspiring young people are keen to get a start in the craftGathered in a studio space within Birmingham Repertory Theatre are a group of people who have either discovered an incredible anti-ageing product, or are bucking a serious trend. According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f66be3284568467ba9c4bec2b9905dfcc818f21/0_142_2622_1573/master/2622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b48d536d9124879c9cca5ea37713cff","title":"joe cokanasiga england debut 11 changes japan autumn internationals rugby union","story":"• Fiji-born 21-year-old on right wing in Jones’s new-look side• Farrell and Hartley drop to bench with Ford named captainJoe Cokanasiga will make his England debut on Saturday as one of 11 new faces brought into Eddie Jones’s side to face Japan. The Fiji-born 21-year-old comes in on the right wing with Jones ringing the changes despite pledging to field his strongest team.The co-captains Owen Farrell and Dylan Hartley are among the frontline players omitted – both are on the bench – with George Ford taking over as skipper. The four survivors from the defeat by New Zealand are Elliot Daly, Chris Ashton, Mark Wilson and Maro Itoje with Zach Mercer coming in at No 8 to make his first England start.Only Daly remains in the same jersey as last week with Jamie George, Harry Williams, Charlie Ewels, Courtney Lawes, Danny Care and Alex Lozowski all making their first starts of the autumn while Jack Nowell gets the nod at outside-centre and Alec Hepburn returns as loosehead. The 19-year-old Worcester back-row Ted Hill, named as an apprentice in Jones’s squad, is on the bench and in line for a debut.“Japan is an important game for us as we want to get back to winning ways,” said Jones. “We have also tested ourselves in having a shorter preparation. We gave the players two days off after three weeks of intensive work. We have had a short preparation but a good preparation.”Cokanasiga’s selection is no surprise considering the form he has shown this season since his summer move to Bath. At 6ft 4in and nearly 18 stone, he provides the hulking size Jones has wanted to introduce into his backline and the news of his first cap comes on his 21st birthday. He has been on Jones’s radar for a while, having been taken on the 2017 tour of Argentina but this is his first involvement in a matchday squad.Ford, meanwhile, captains England on his own for the first time having undertaken the role in a shared capacity with Chris Robshaw before, as Hartley is named among the replacements for only the second time under Jones.The decision to make so many changes makes obvious sense with Jones attempting to mirror his side’s short turnaround between their first and second World Cup pool matches against Tonga and the USA next year. As a result, Jonny May, Ben Youngs, Ben Te’o and Brad Shields all miss out on the 23-man squad with Lawes replacing the latter at blindside flanker. Richard Wigglesworth is set for a first appearance of the autumn from the bench.Jones added: “This weekend is a good opportunity for us to test the depth of the squad. A number of players have changed their roles going from finishers to starters and starters to finishers so that is the essential change to the squad. It is exciting to be able to give starting opportunities to Zach Mercer and Joe Cokanasiga and young Ted Hill on the bench.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16b1d64684e61e52387bedbdfcb09685c63448d5/138_0_4873_2925/master/4873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5ac9aac00640ad407747c24dfb2151","title":"talking horses jerry mcgrath aiming to right a wrong at betvictor gold cup","story":"Rather Be presents Nicky Henderson’s jockey with a shot at the biggest success of his career on SaturdayThe chance to right an old wrong is presented to the jockey Jerry McGrath on Saturday, when he gets a shot at the biggest success of his career in the BetVictor Gold Cup aboard the favourite, Rather Be. The pair were edged out in a photo at the Cheltenham Festival in March but the betting market fancies their chance of revenge over Mister Whitaker.“They keep showing replays of the Cheltenham run on TV,” said McGrath between races at Bangor on Wednesday. “I still can’t let that go. But hopefully we’ll try and make amends for it.“I had Rocklander on my inside and I won the battle with him, only for Mister Whitaker to come up on my outside and give me another battle. I probably used up a bit too much petrol trying to beat the horse on my inside. Then again, it’s Cheltenham, so you do just throw the kitchen sink at them. It’s just, I’d have preferred if Mister Whitaker had gone on and won by a length and a half. The fact it went down to a photo, it’s hard to let go.”Long established as one of Nicky Henderson’s jockeys, the 27-year-old McGrath is in fine form, picking up some plum rides during the absence of Nico de Boinville through a thumb injury. He relished victory in Wincanton’s Elite Hurdle aboard the very speedy Verdana Blue last weekend and Rather Be gives him a rare chance of TV glory on consecutive Saturdays.“I’m really looking forward to him. He’s taken a while to come to hand but I schooled a few last Thursday and he was the one that put the biggest smile on my face, he was brilliant.”A native of Waterfall, County Cork, McGrath was raised around horses on his father’s farm but didn’t sit on a racehorse until he was 15, when the speed and danger of jump racing lured him away from the show jumping path he’d been following. He first rode for Henderson eight years ago and is grateful for the array of talent at the Lambourn yard, which means he can ride top-class horses at the secondary race-meetings even when De Boinville is fit.“You have to be realistic too,” he says, recalling last year’s BetVictor, in which his mount was unsighted at the first and fell, causing McGrath to break an arm. “You need a lot of luck in running. But we’re going there with a good chance.”McGrath goes to Ludlow for one ride for Henderson on Thursday, that one being Jillythejet, a points winner making her rules debut in the opener. It’s not a race that appeals to me as much as the staying handicap chase later on the card, in which Hepijeu (2.55) looks overpriced at 7-1.This seven-year-old has been through a few yards but seems to have rediscovered his mojo since switching to Stuart Edmunds in September. He reeled off three wins over hurdles in three weeks, having not won in that sphere since 2015, and followed up with a second place over fences to a well-backed Olly Murphy rival who was completing a hat-trick.On the ratings, that was his best effort since April 2016 and a repeat might be good enough from the same handicap mark here. The potential fly in the ointment is Gardiners Hill, an easy winner on Friday, but he carries a penalty for scoring against a handful of rivals and it’s not easy to win two staying races in such a short time.Earlier, 11-2 isn’t bad about Cap St Vincent (1.50) from the in-form Tim Vaughan yard, with reasons to doubt the two market-leaders.

It is an understandable viewpoint given he takes huge pleasure in racing on classic circuits packed with fans but much less so in front of empty grandstands. Yet that he should express his feelings having recently claimed a fifth title suggests a possible subtext. Hamilton is considering F1’s future and therein lies his final challenge: matching or beating Michael Schumacher.With Vietnam now on the calendar for 2020, Hamilton was not enamoured of the idea. “I don’t know how important it is to go to new countries as such,” he told the BBC. “If you had the Silverstone Grand Prix and a London Grand Prix, it would be pretty cool. We’ve got a lot of real racing history in England, Germany, Italy and now in the States it is starting to grow. But you only have one event per year in those places. If it was my business, I would be trying to do more events in those countries.”Fans in the US might rightly take umbrage at part of that statement but his rationale of building on existing strengths is sound, borne out by the failures of India, Turkey and Korea to foster an audience for racing.“If you have the German Grand Prix and you’ve got a grand prix in Berlin, I think connecting to cities where a lot of people are is probably a good thing,” he added. “Not necessarily going to countries where they don’t know so much about Formula One.”He has said similar before but it was perhaps what he said last that was most interesting. He had addressed where the sport was going but considered his path as well. “I feel I have still got more years, more days ahead if I am lucky, and there are still many mountains to climb,” he said. “There will still be difficult times ahead. I don’t know when they will come, but I feel better prepared now than I ever have been.”A sentiment he has expressed before, suggesting a strength of purpose that means the world champion can match Schumacher. As things stand it is entirely conceivable that he will do so.Hamilton is 33 now and 19 race wins behind the German’s record. He is contracted to Mercedes for two more years and is two championships behind Schumacher’s seven.Hamilton has never chased records but takes obvious pleasure in them once they are achieved. After he equalled Juan Manuel Fangio’s five in Mexico, there was a clear intent. “Whether or not I’m going to have the chance to win more, who knows,” he said. “But I’m going to give it everything to do so.He will doubtless approach it one season at a time as always but if Hamilton wanted a springboard from which to launch toward Schumacher’s records, his current situation could not be better.With the regulations set until 2021 the competitive order will almost certainly remain the same. Short of Honda providing Red Bull with an exceptional power unit, it will be a two-way fight between Mercedes and Ferrari. In the past two years Hamilton has had the best of that against Sebastian Vettel.His team have also enjoyed the upper hand over the Scuderia. This season, against a quicker Ferrari, they were on a higher level, with an ability to adapt and improve under pressure. In team principal Toto Wolff, strategist James Vowles and designer James Allison, they have a leadership every bit as strong as Schumacher enjoyed with Jean Todt, Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne.Hamilton has averaged 10 wins per season over the last five years: doing so again is well within his grasp. This year he managed it in a car that for some time was not the best. Equally he has been almost unchallenged by his teammate Valtteri Bottas. Crucially, as Schumacher did, he has taken wins when on the back foot and believes he is driving better than ever, a claim almost impossible to dispute.Nothing is given of course but as things stand he could not be better placed for a push to the summit of seven. If he does so, with Mercedes having been through two regulations changes and both times emerging with the best car, there is no reason to believe they would not be highly competitive again. At which point, regardless of where F1 is racing, Hamilton may well consider it worth taking on far-flung challenges to try and stand alone with an eighth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8703b12c7c009b1de3efed699f475377db63145e/111_205_5118_3073/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4b4c97cf1e51310761994eceb499e3","title":"sri lanka v england second test day two live","story":"An excellent innings from Roshen Silva, playing only because Dinesh Chandimal is injured, rescued Sri Lanka from potential collapse and helped them to a first-innings lead the match is now beautifully poisedRight then: here’s Vic Marks’ report of today’s play. Cheerio.Ravi Bopara, who played with Ben Foakes at Essex, says that he’s the best keeper England have, but we’ll see about his batting when the ball swings at home. He’s good against spin, though, so should be in the team when they tour the sub-Continent. The horns in this are so, so good. Gotta love Mr Fabulous and Blue Lou. I discussed this with myself earlier, but Willis and Colville reckon it’ll be just Moeen as the spinner in the summer. I guess he’s good in English conditions and can bat, but I’d love to see Rashid in. Bob Willis notes that Leach doesn’t bowl enough maidens, though he managed five and Moeen and Rashid just two and one respectively. It’s for that reason that Root can’t attack with the fields - they’re too easy to milk. Apparently the stats say that batting fourth at Kandy ain’t no thing, which is obviously worth paying attention to given it’s not England who’ll be doing it. Still, they’re more than capable of taking it out of the equation by collapsing in the third innings. Ravi Bopara is on the verdict I’m pretty sure he could do a job at the top of the order...The more I think about it, the more this is a match for Joe Root. He looked great in the first innings before getting himself out, and he’s got precisely the kind of supple technique and scoring rhythm that does the necessary on a track like this one. He’s overdue a definitive innings as well. So what’s a good total for England? I guess they’ll want to set a minimum of 250 - they’ll have to bat well to get there, but they’ve just see Sri Lanka do it. And the Lankan attack is decent in these conditions, but not loads more than that. Leach doesn’t think he put enough balls in the correct areas, and doesn’t feel more pressure when the wicket turns because it means he’s in the game. He says that the pitch is consistent, but when the ball’s hard some skid and some don’t. Jack Leach is amused and pleased to have opened for England. Rory Burns said he’d waited a career for that, and he’s looking forward to telling Marcus Trescothick that they’re in the same club. He confesses that England thought they might have a lead, but that Sri Lanka are under pressure because it’ll be them batting last. Athers disagrees with me - he’s obviously never played the game - saying that there’s enough in the pitch to mind the ball that gets you out. So he reckons England won’t bat time, but will look to attack. In fact we’re not quite done yet! Athers reckons it made sense to send out Leach, to take losing a front-line batsman out of the equation. The pitch doesn’t look to be deteriorating, so should play much as it played today - a little slower than yesterday, says my intimate encounter with it from a box-room in north London. I wonder if England will be more circumspect than in the first innings because the pitch is not so vicious as to demand all-out attack it’s the sort of pitch on which you’d expect a major contribution from Joe Root. We shall see! Join us tomorrow for more of the same! Ta-ra. Another great one it was, was it, it was. Sri Lanka will claim it as theirs, coming back brilliantly in the second half to establish not only a lead but themselves in the series. England won’t be happy with how they bowled, but you have to credit Roshen and the tail for getting the balance between stick and stickability just right. 1st over: England 0-0 (Leach 0, Burns 0) There’s a party around the bat as Perera leaps in, Leach snapping down the bat just in time to keep out the loosener. He defends the second, leaves the third, and this is intense can we have a few mores please? No we cannot, as another man comes in close on the offside - that’s four - and Leach blocks nicely, then again, before leaving the final delivery. And that’s a DAY.Right then, here we go. Leach is coming out with Rory Burns because he’s had an easy day Jennings is having a little relax. Leach, I imagine, has the honour of facing - lucky man - which makes sense because England can’t be losing a wicket, but if they do, it may as well not be a batsman. That’s some recovery from 165-6 the pitch, reckon our experts, is a slow turner, and there’s no excuse for acting like it’s anything more. I wonder how Burns and Jennings are sorting out who faces - “You have the honour, I couldn’t possibly....” So Sri Lanka lead by 46 - they’d have taken that three hours ago - and England must see out an over before the close. And there it is! Lakmal leaves him the final ball of the over to negotiate, is that really too much to ask of him? Yes it is! He drives straight to mid on, and that’s the end of an absolutely terrific innings, measured, skilful and vital. Only in because of injury to Dinesh Chandimal, I think he might keep his place after this.102nd over: Sri Lanka 332-9 (Roshen 84, Lakmal 12) Leach returns as, in commentary, they say that the pitch is no different to what you’d expect at Kandy and though you can’t score freely, batsmen who apply themselves will make runs. I wonder if we’ll see unusually high scores in the second innings - not for the track, but relative to what we’ve seen in the first. Maiden. 100th over: Sri Lanka 332-9 (Roshen 84, Lakmal 12) A full over of Roshen facing Rashid - perhaps he wants to keep him away from Lakmal, perhaps he trusts Lakmal. A googly clipping the pad earns two byes, then a carve to backward point earns two more. England look out of of ideas, but Ben Stokes still hasn’t had a shy with the new ball. I don’t quite get that, because he’s just one of those kids to whom things happen. 99th over: Sri Lanka 328-9 (Roshen 82, Lakmal 12) Lakmal has been solid so far, and when Moeen serves him one on the pads, he cracks it to square leg where Currance es in installments, allowing it under his body like he’s Bobby Mimms. These are the only runs off the over - that’s 100 overs in the day - and I was incorrect in saying that we were done when they’d been completed. There’s more! 98th over: Sri Lanka 324-9 (Roshen 82, Lakmal 8) What! Rashid drops short but gets lots of grip and spin, while Roshen chucks the spirit of his ancestors and their suitcases at it - his good fortune is that he misses everything with everything and plays out a maiden. Lakmal has strike for the final over. 97th over: Sri Lanka 324-9 (Roshen 82, Lakmal 8) Moeen is finding plenty of turn but Roshen is cool with it, taking a single off his first ball to long off. Lakmal then takes one to leg, sprinting to make sure, before Silva leaves him one delivery to negotiate with another one - England haven’t bowled well with the new igneous, but Sri Lanka have batted very well, calm and decisive in their shot selection. Lakmal sees away the dot, and the day is nearly done. 96th over: Sri Lanka 321-9 (Roshen 80, Lakmal 7) Here he is: Rashid to have a go. He’s not bowled well today, but has taken two wickets with deliveries beyond any other English spinner. Roshen takes a single with two balls of the over to go, and Lakmal handles the rest very nicely thanks you. Three overs left in the day. 95th over: Sri Lanka 320-9 (Roshen 79, Lakmal 7) I wonder if Rashid is still out of the attack because runs are at a premium Moeen continues and is milked, Lakmal looking assured in contributing a single and Roshen adding a two and two ones, easily walking down to drive to the final ball to long on and retain the strike. 94th over: Sri Lanka 315-9 (Roshen 75, Lakmal 6) Anderson will fancy getting shot of Sri Lanka’s paceman and captain, but he gets down the other end with a single backward of square on the off side. Roshen then tucks one to midwicket, and Lakmal bottom edges a pull for four, behind the stumps naturally, Anderson congratulates him on his good fortune before falling about clutching himself with laughter. 93rd over: Sri Lanka 309-9 (Roshen 74, Lakmal 1) Huge turn for Moeen first up to Lakmal, and he hits the pad - but there’s no way that wasn’t going down if it pitched in line. I wonder if Roshen will go now - he’s seeing it well, and Lakmal is surely not long for this innings. An excellent innings comes to an end. Moeen coaxes one to straighten and Danajaya plays for turn, wearing it on the kneeroll. He knows. 93rd over: Sri Lanka 307-8 (Roshen 73, Dananjaya 31) Dananjaya cuts and Roshen sets off, but Burns, at cover point, es superbly to field and shy - so quickly that Anderson can’t get behind the stumps. Burns misses - perhaps he had longer than he thought to aim - and the chance goes. Maiden. 92nd over: Sri Lanka 307-8 (Roshen 73, Dananjaya 31) Moeen replaces Curran, and Roshen inside-edges him for one England are ticking out there now, and Dananjaya adds one more to cover. But HAVE A LOOK! Roshen sidesteps down and absolutely hammers Moeen over his head for six! Drinks! “Will it be Rashid?Graham Onions swings?We’ll have to wait and see”, sings Mark Hooper. If Test cricket has taught us one thing, it’s that it’s never Graham Onions swings. 91st over: Sri Lanka 299-8 (Roshen 66, Dananjaya 30) Root and Stokes chat before Anderson continues - I’d not be averse to seeing him from one end and spin from the other. Anyway, Dananjaya edges four, then clatters a drive and Buttler, at cover, es Ramprakash 1991-style ... but can’t hang on. England try and change the ball. 90th over: Sri Lanka 294-8 (Roshen 65, Dananjaya 26) Curran almost does something, swing suddenly materialising when Dananjaya is halfway through his shot and taking the ball straight, eliciting a leading edge that drops at extra cover. That was a very unusual delivery and a beaut, but it yields a run and Sri Lanka have the lead without the pyrotechnics we saw from England, this is another useful late-order effort, and Dananjaya underlines that with two more to fine leg. At what point do England’s openers want to keep them out there to avoid having to bat tonight? 89th over: Sri Lanka 290-8 (Roshen 64, Dananjaya 23) Thanks to those who’ve reminded me that Buttler can’t top score in the match because Curran has already outscored him I was distracted by the country falling apart! Anderson to continue, and his first ball greets Roshen’s thigh, but high and leg side. Silva then takes two to leg, and levels the scores with two more via long leg and sprinting. The Lankans are now spieling with house money - another 50+ and we’re talking, as Anderson spirits another one past Roshen’s outside edge. 88th over: Sri Lanka 286-8 (Roshen 60, Dananjaya 23) The new ball hasn’t been well utilised so far, so Curran has a go and Dananjaya finds swing but offers enough width to go through the covers ... then goes straight enough to be twizzled to fine leg fo fo mo. Two more arrive via pads, and that’s not a good over from the man who can do no wrong - I’m sure he did it on purpose for reasons currently outside of our comprehension, or is that Brexit? 87th over: Sri Lanka 276-8 (Roshen 60, Dananjaya 13) The standard of concentration demanded of an umpire is something, never mind the quantity of standing still. What’s the worst job you’ve ever had? I don’t suppose I can go beyond being a trainee lawyer, though I did once do schlepping for a travel agent moving office, who shouted at me a lot. And on one notable occasion, sent me out to get breakfast: “Get the money from my pocket, I know how much is there, don’t steal any, get something for yourself then, when I returned: “You didn’t want that chocolate croissant did you?” Worst of all, the job wasn’t mine, I was sitting in for a mate who was away, so never got to educate him as to himself. Maiden. 86th over: Sri Lanka 276-8 (Roshen 60, Dananjaya 13) Leach goes short and Roshen cuts posthumously ... they run a single and then the umpires meet for a yachne, appearing first to signal dead ball, then deduct the run for absent-minded non-grounding of the bat by Roshen. Well, that’s a bit of excitement! Roshen quickly restores his score, then Dananjaya drives two square on the off side. Ah ... England have been awarded five penalty runs. 85th over: Sri Lanka 273-8 (Roshen 59, Dananjaya 11) Anderson comes from over this time, and his third ball is a dish, banged in, slanted across, and Dananjaya is desperate to edge but it’s just too pretty for him. Two singles follow, and what an innings this is from Roshen. I wondered yesterday if Buttler’s score would be the highest of the match, but that looks exceedingly unlikely now. 84th over: Sri Lanka 271-8 (Roshen 58, Dananjaya 10) Oh it’s Leach, it’s Leach, oh we ope it’s Leach, it’s Leach. Single to Dananjaya, then Roshen leaves a goodun and cuts hard at the next ... Stokes parries what was a twentieth of a chance, a tenth to him. Anyway, isn’t it nice to have this cricket to absorb ourselves with, lucky there’s nothing else going on in the world. 83rd over: Sri Lanka 270-8 (Roshen 58, Dananjaya 9) Anderson starts from around to the left-handed Dananjaya, who gets down the other end thanks to a leg bye. The next delivery is well outside off, but the third is a beaut, moving away off middle and almost taking the edge with it. Roshen then turns two into the leg side, a dot follows, and who will be given the spheroid from the other end. Me, I’d like to see Rashid, but more likely it’s Leach. 82nd over: Sri Lanka 267-8 (Roshen 56, Dananjaya 9) Leach to continue, with a leg slip and a short leg, so Dananjaya goes down the ground for two. Two balls later, though, prodigious turn beats him all ends up, an inside edge squirting past those two fielders and earning him one. Two more singles follow, and now we have our fresh meteorite. Here’s Jimmy! 81st over: Sri Lanka 262-8 (Roshen 55, Dananjaya 5) Er, actually that’s not the new ball Moeen will have a twiddle with the old one. And he starts with a loose one, offering width and and time - Dananjaya cuts for three, allowing Roshen to reverse for four despite Stokes anticipating the shot from slip. Moeen improves thereafter, beating the bat with better length and more turn, but two singles make this an expensive over, nine from it. 80th over: Sri Lanka 253-8 (Roshen 50, Dananjaya 1) Ok, it was hitting leg stump dead one, two thirds of the way up. Dananjaya sends his first ball to square leg for one and that’s the new ball will Root see if the new man can move his feet and use spin from both ends? Leach sends one straight on with the arm, Perera misses his flick, and off he pops! Looking at it again, it was closer to going down leg than it seemed, but I can see why the batsmen didn’t review.

Which is the best choice? I have soldiered on with a 2009 MacBook Pro, which I use for internet access, social media, photos, and my research. But in order to access the university library remotely, I have to use an up-to-date operating system, and my Mac is so old I can no longer update it.So, I need to buy a new MacBook, but I am overwhelmed by the options. Do I need a Touch Bar? How much memory and SSD do I need? MaryFollowing the product refresh on 30 October, Apple has four MacBooks that do much the same job. The good news is that, if you can survive on a 2009 MacBook Pro, any of them would be fine for your purposes. The bad news is that they all have features that would put me off buying them, though, with luck, they won’t necessarily put you off.However, I do think it’s essential to visit an Apple Store or other stockist so that you can compare at least two 13in MacBooks side by side. These are the old MacBook Air (best keyboard, worst screen) and the MacBook Pro (horrible keyboard, great screen).I can tell you which chips are faster, and so on, but your personal experience will be dominated by the quality of the keyboard and screen. A blog post can’t tell you which ones you will like, or where you would prefer to make compromises.For me, the biggest problem with the new MacBooks is the butterfly keyboard, which was first introduced with the 12in MacBook in 2015. The second version appeared in MacBook Pros, where a number of users had keyboard failures due to dust or detritus getting under the keys. The latest MacBooks have a third version with extra sealing to keep out dust. We have yet to see how it stands up over time.Apart from that, I find the butterfly keyboard provides a horrible typing experience. I learned to touch-type on typewriters, and I prefer keyboards with mechanical keys with lots of travel. Butterfly keys have almost no travel. This would push me towards the old MacBook Air, which has a very good keyboard by laptop standards.Sadly, the old MacBook Air has other problems. In particular, the touchpad and screen are worse than the ones in the new MacBook Air. (They’re not bad, but they are not as good.)Happily, tastes vary. Some people prefer flat, unresponsive keyboards, and you may find you like the butterfly keyboard. If so, it makes your choice easier. I just think you need to give it a serious go – type a few hundred words on it – before you commit to using it all day every day … or carrying an external USB keyboard around.You don’t need a Touch Bar. In fact, no one really needs a Touch Bar. Either way, they are only fitted to the more expensive MacBook Pros, and I assume you’re not interested in buying a much more expensive MacBook than you need.The 13in mid-2009 MacBook Pro had an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which is dire by today’s standards. The base model only had 2GB of memory (expandable to 8GB) and a 160GB hard drive, though custom upgrades included 128GB and 256GB SSDs. The lowliest MacBook you can buy today will have better specifications.Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade today’s MacBooks, so you have to buy as much power as you will ever need. For longevity, it would be better to have 16GB of memory and a 256GB or larger SSD, but Apple charges a huge premium for these upgrades.Fortunately, MacBooks hold their value quite well, so the alternative is to go for the base spec and, if you find you need more power, sell it and buy a new one.There is a non-obvious problem in that two of your possible MacBooks have Intel Core M processors, which compromise on speed to provide better battery life. Apple first tried this with the 1.1GHz dual-core M-5Y31 chip used in the 2015 MacBook (12in screen). Today, Core M chips are used not only in 12in MacBooks, but also in the latest MacBook Airs.It’s not obvious because Intel changed its naming scheme. People who might have been put off by the “Core M” designation probably won’t notice that they are getting a Y series chip – specifically, a Core i5-8210Y – instead of the more powerful U series chips used in mainstream laptops.I have nothing against Core MY series chips, and my 8GB128GB touch-screen Lenovo Yoga 700 has the same Core M3-6Y30 used in some MacBooks. The difference is that it’s a machine for casualholiday use, not my main system and it only cost me £339.99. I wouldn’t buy one as my main machine, and charging £1,200 for one is ridiculous.A Core i5-8210Y should be fast enough for your light uses – which may grow over time – but it’s still poor value for money in a MacBook Air.Apple has retained the old 13in MacBook Air, and it looks the best value for money at £949, despite its fifth-generation Core i5-5350U processor and non-retina screen. It has, in my view, the best keyboard, and it still has good old-fashioned ports, including an SD card slot and a magsafe connector. In all other respects, the new MacBook Air (2018) is far superior.The old 12in MacBook is still available, but it’s underpowered and overpriced, with the 1.2GHz Core M3-7Y32 version (2017) costing £1,249. The only reason for considering this machine is that it’s the smallest and lightest (0.92kg) MacBook you can get.The new 13in MacBook Air is smaller and lighter than the old version, has a far superior screen, a bigger force-touch trackpad, and better speakers. It’s also more expensive at £1,199. The drawbacks include the butterfly keyboard and the Core MY series processor.Finally, there’s the 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar (mid-2017), which provides a faster seventh-generation 2.3GHz Core i5 (7360U) processor, much better graphics and better colour rendering for an extra £50, ie £1,249. The Pro also has a brighter screen – 500 nits instead of 300 nits – which should be much better for outdoor use. You lose the Air’s wedge shape, which is more comfortable for typing, but the Pro isn’t significantly heavier than the new Air (1.37kg vs 1.25kg).I’d like the MacBook Pro more if it had the old Air keyboard, but it seems to me it’s the best buy – if you can afford it. I also think it’s your best bet for future operating system updates.Upgrades are, as mentioned, expensive. Increasing the Pro’s 8GB of memory to 16GB costs £180, and upgrading the 128GB SSD to 256GB costs £200, so the spec you really want costs £1,629. Adding AppleCare bumps the final price up to £1,878.It’s a lot of money, but think of it as £1 a day over five years and it won’t feel so bad.As a graduate student, you should qualify for an educational discount, which will bring down the price.

I can’t tell how much you’d get without the serial number of your MacBook Pro. It’s probably not a lot, but at least the old warhorse would get recycled properly.Have you got a question?

What if it had focused on some of the artist’s less endearing moments?The 2018 John Lewis ad is heartwarming. Elton John sits alone at his piano, playing Your Song while moments of his life flash before his eyes. He sings in a stadium, he sings in the studio, he sings in a pub, he sings at a school concert. It’s a very sweet advert with a very simple message: somebody better call Elton John an ambulance right away, because this is exactly the sort of thing that happens right before you die.In fact, the advert is probably too heartwarming. Just a few weeks ago, the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody was heavily criticised for its toothless portrayal of Freddie Mercury’s worst excesses, and the same could be said for the John Lewis advert. Elton John isn’t a great pop star because he sings songs about little dancers, crocodiles that rock and being able to stand up. No, Elton John is a great pop star because he is knotty and complicated and, well, a bit of a dick sometimes.If the John Lewis Christmas ad is going to go down as a lasting tribute to Elton’s career – and, boy, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write – then it should have picked some better memories for him to have. Luckily for you, I have written a new version. There is still time to make this before Christmas, John Lewis.It is Christmas morning. Elton John sits alone at his piano, wistfully tapping out opening notes of Your Song. He looks old and vulnerable. He blinks. He swallows. Then, as the melody soars beneath his fingers, he drifts into a reverie and is transported to …Las Vegas, March 2018. Elton John is in the middle of his Million Dollar Piano residency, playing Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting for all it’s worth. But something is troubling him. He leans over to look at an audience member he invited onstage. “Fuck off,” he mouths. Ten seconds later, more aggrieved, he mouths it again, then points angrily, then stops playing, then leaves the stage in a huff. When he returns, he tells the entire audience “You fucked it up”, before he spins away again, lost in a dream.Taiwan, 2004. Elton John’s private plane touches down in Taipei. It’s distant and exotic, just one of many astonishing places that Elton has visited as a direct consequence of his mother scrimping and saving for a piano all those years ago. He is swarmed by photographers, amazed that such a global star is visiting their country. His response? “Rude, vile pigs! Do you know what that means? Rude, vile pigs! That’s what all of you are.” An appalled photographer shouts: “Get out of Taiwan!” To which Elton replies: “We’d love to get out of Taiwan if it’s full of people like you. Pig! Pig!” The strings soar as he is swept even further into a river of nostalgia.New York, March 2000. Elton John becomes upset during a performance of his own musical and storms out.France, 1996. A woman says “Yoo-hoo” to Elton John while he is playing tennis. In response, Elton storms off the court. “I’m never coming to the south of France again,” he seethes.London, the 1980s. After spending the last few days fully awake, Elton John phones one of his employees and angrily orders him to somehow make London less windy.The music now reaches a crescendo, and then …It’s Christmas morning again. Elton finishes playing Your Song and, with a nostalgic tear in his eye, gently shuts the lid. But then he notices the cameraman in his peripheral vision and loses his temper, screaming profanities and flinging vases until the cameraman is forced to escape and flee for his life. Finally, the new slogan appears: “John Lewis. If we can deal with him, we can deal with you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2681aed65968dea793f68990a1141e90fcf9f580/0_537_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cda6dcc6ec58d3f34a957be439af03b","title":"woman on trial over child found in squalid car boot in france","story":"Partner and sister of accused say they had no idea she had given birth to fourth childRelatives of a woman who hid her baby in the maggot-infested boot of a car have said they had no idea of her secret, during a trial that has drawn horror in France.Rosa-Maria Da Cruz, 50, is accused of keeping her daughter Séréna hidden away until she was nearly two, leaving her with serious learning disabilities.Séréna was discovered in 2013 in the filthy boot of a Peugeot 307 and had also been kept in an unused room at the family home in the Corrèze region of central France.It was a mechanic who found her in the boot after Da Cruz, who is originally from Portugal, had taken the car to be repaired. Hearing a noise, he opened the boot to discover the baby in a car seat, naked, filthy and dehydrated. She was surrounded by maggots and excrement.The trial, which opened on Monday, has heard testimony from relatives about how Da Cruz was, to all appearances, a model mother to her three other children.Her partner, Domingos Sampaio Alves, has said he had no idea she had given birth to another child and she had kept it a secret. By way of explanation, he said he went only about once a month to the small ground-floor room, under renovation, where Da Cruz kept the baby much of the time. He also did not visit the car often as he does not have a driving licence.“I don’t know why she did this,” he told the court in Portuguese through a translator.The unemployed bricklayer was originally charged, but investigators concluded there was no reason to doubt his account. Da Cruz was released pending trial, and the couple have stayed together. “I continue to live with her because she is a good mother to the children,” Alves told the court.They have kept their three older children – aged nine, 14 and 15 – but authorities have refused to let them have contact with Serena, who is now aged seven and living with foster parents.In her opening testimony on Monday, Da Cruz fought back tears and told the court: “It’s very hard to be confronted with reality, with the damage I have done.”Séréna now suffers from severe mental impairments including irreversible autism, which medical experts have linked to sensory deprivation during her early months.A paediatrician who examined Séréna and her siblings after the discovery said her team had been “stupefied” by “the gulf between Séréna’s situation and those of her brothers and sisters”, who appeared to have been “perfectly raised”.“You could see she had been a good mother, and we could not understand why Séréna had not received the same quality of care at home,” the doctor said.The judge Gilles Fonrouge said that while the child was now in good physical health, she was “closed off to interactions around her”.Marie-Pierre Peis-Hitier, a lawyer for the social services, said the child could say only a handful of words, and it had taken a full afternoon to win the child’s trust.Da Cruz’s sister and nieces also said they had no idea of Séréna’s existence, and said Da Cruz was a “loving” mother to the other children.“Inside I think she is suffering. She knows what she has done,” her niece Elodie told the court.The court heard that Da Cruz had initially hidden the pregnancies of two of her other children from her partner, not wanting to face reality.Da Cruz is charged with violence against a minor and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The trial continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f100ffc6f555d884bd475a9c40d63efd05034fc/0_3_3432_2060/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafb2890c9581e40ff01e298e92a9ff0","title":"cats onomichi art museum japan","story":"Plucky pair have been trying to enter Onomichi gallery for two years, to no availTwo cats that have spent the past two years trying to enter an art museum in western Japan – only to be politely turned away at the door – have become online celebrities with a global following willing them on in their attempts to see at least one exhibit up close.Ken-chan, a black cat, attempted his first solo foray into the Onomichi city museum of art in summer 2016 during an exhibition of cat photography, but was prevented from entering by a security guard in a gentle standoff that was caught on camera.“I’m guessing that Ken-chan spotted some of the exhibits through the glass, and since the photos included those of black cats, he must have thought he had found a new friend,” the museum’s curator, Shinji Umebayashi, told the . “And then he just kept coming back.”Not to be deterred, Ken-chan started turning up accompanied by a ginger cat the museum staff named Go-chan. “I’d seen him around so we think he must live locally, but we’re not sure where, exactly,” Umebayashi said.Ken-chan has struck up a friendship with the museum’s security guard, who playfully sends him on his way whenever he attempts to cross the threshold.A post on the museum’s Twitter account from last month shows Ken-chan waiting patiently outside before making a bid for the entrance as the automatic doors begin to close. The guard springs into action, keeping his friend out of harm’s way.Photographs and video clips of their exchanges have gone viral. Some people on social media have implored the museum to allow Ken-chan in. Most, though, are just charmed by the interaction between the guard and his feline friend.The museum, which has more than 45,000 Twitter followers, recently launched a range of souvenirs featuring the two cats, but is struggling to keep up with demand amid a rise in visitors and orders sent via social media.Ken-chan and Go-chan, who continue to visit “most days”, are often seen together in the museum grounds, said Umebayashi, adding that despite both being male, they have never exchanged so much as a hiss. “The museum is in a park so there’s no traffic to worry about,” he said. “They treat the park like it’s their own garden.”Even though Ken-chan’s feline cunning is unlikely to outsmart museum staff and gain him free admission, as the resident cat at a nearby restaurant, at least he does not have far to walk home after yet another foiled attempt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a321da1244e7320492dbe56f3f7be085e4ef73/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fd3e68770c69cfa69bf62cfe53ddf1f","title":"rohingya refugee repatriations bangladesh myanmar","story":"Repatriations will be ‘totally voluntary’ but no one spoken to by UN was willing to goBangladesh has said it is fully prepared to begin repatriating Rohingya refugees to Myanmar but emphasised it would not force anyone to go back against their will.Four trucks and three buses have been stationed at Unchiprang camp in Cox’s Bazar since Thursday morning, ready to carry refugees who have been “approved” to a transit camp by the border – but not one refugee has been willing to board them.Most on a list of those approved to return have gone into hiding.Mohammad Abul Kalam, Bangladesh’s refugee relief and rehabilitation commissioner, told the  his team had completed the “physical and logistical preparations” to facilitate the repatriation.“We decided to repatriate refugees from the Unchiprang camp today,” he said. “Our entire team has reached the camp in the morning. There is also a medical team, which is ready to accompany the returning refugees up to the border. If we get anyone voluntarily willing to return, we will help them cross the border.”Abul Kalam emphasised that Bangladesh was “totally committed to the principle of the non-refoulement and voluntary repatriation”. “We will not force anyone to go back to Myanmar against his or her will,” he said.More than 2,000 Rohingya refugees had been put on the list approved by Myanmar for return, without their consent. While the plan was to send them back in batches of 150 per day, by Wednesday night almost all had gone into hiding in other camps and in the nearby forest amid fears they would be sent to Myanmar against their will.Hours before repatriation was due to begin, the UN high commissioner for refugees had located just 50 families listed for repatriation, all of whom said they did not want to return to Myanmar in the current conditions.However, while Abul Kalam acknowledged most Rohingya were still too afraid to return, he insisted: “At least some Rohingya, we believe, are willing to go back to Myanmar now. We are trying to reach them in different camps. We are ready to help them return to Myanmar.”The few who are reportedly willing to return are 420 Hindus – but Kalam said they were focusing on repatriating Rohingya for the time being and would repatriate those Hindus at a later stage.Mohammad Idris, a Rohingya community leader who was at a meeting at Unchiprang camp on Thursday morning, said all 50 of the families in the camp listed for return had “disappeared from their shacks three or four days ago and the officials have failed to trace them”.He added: “Since this morning, army and police have surrounded the camp. Refugee and other administrative officials have been holding meetings with the majhis and other Rohingya community leaders seeking their help to persuade the listed refugees to return to Myanmar.”Rohingya refugees told the  of the multiple ways the Bangladesh authorities were trying to “persuade” refugees to go back, including telling them that it was the only way they would get the Myanmar government to give them rights and citizenship.They also made direct threats. Saifullah, who lives in Balukhali camp, said the (Camp in Charge) CIC had warned the majhis of “stern actions” if the Rohingya who are in the repatriation list did not return to Myanmar.“The CIC have been telling Rohingya refugees will face hardship if they do not return to Myanmar,” he said. “They are threatening to stop supplying rations to refugees, saying they will be barred from working with the different NGOs and will not have the freedom to move around freely.”The UN has called on both governments to halt the “rushed” repatriation plans but the pleas appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Bangladesh, however, tried to quell the panic by instructing NGOs it maintained its commitment to voluntary returns and that all NGOs should continue their work as usual.There are more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees living in Cox’s Bazar who fled a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military in August 2017, which was described by the UN fact-finding mission as genocide. Women were raped, children massacred and thousands killed, while most Rohingya villages in Rakhine state were burned to the ground.According to the head of the UN fact-finding mission, the genocide in Rakhine against the Muslim minority was ongoing, and there were demonstrations this week among Buddhist Rakhine communities who protested against the return of the Rohingya.Myanmar has insisted it is ready for returns and laid the blame for any delays at Bangladesh’s door. Officials have stated that refugees from Cox’s Bazar will be processed in one of the two centres built by Bangladesh and then transported to Myanmar either by boat or on land to Hla Phoe Khaung transition camp, in Rakhine state.The Myanmar government have assured the international community the Rohingya will then be housed in new homes built in Maungdaw, one of the three areas in which the Rohingya had lived before the crackdown, though they will not be allowed to travel outside of the township. Most will also be unable to return to their original homes and villages because they were destroyed by the military."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3698619.1542277955!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit dominic raab leads series of resignations over exit deal","story":"British Prime Minister was jeered during her statement on her Brexit agreement, one which has seen a series of resignations.

Photograph:  Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has led a series of resignations from Theresa May’s cabinet on Thursday in the wake of the publication of a draft agreement on Britain’s exit from the European Union.Work and pensions secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman quit following the earlier departure of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and junionr minister for Northern Ireland Shailesh Vara . The aide to the education minister Anne-Marie Trevalyan also resigned.The departures put prime minister Theresa May’s government into turmoil after she secured a Brexit deal that was criticised by opponents, allies and mutinous members of her party.“The deal you put before the Cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum”, Ms McVey wrote in a letter to May.Mr Raab wrote: “I regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign” . May’s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom, he said.“I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election. This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.”European Union leaders will meet on November 25th to endorse the orce deal. Mrs May now faces the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament to approve the deal.Westminster was braced for further resignations, amid widespread expectations that the prime minister may face a challenge to her position from Conservative MPs submitting letters of no confidence in her leadership.Following the Brexit Secretary’s resignation, former Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted: “Well done Dominic Raab, a few more and we will be rid of this duplicitous Prime Minister.Hours earlier Shailesh Vara had quit as minister of state for Northern Ireland, saying Mrs May’s agreement, “leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation”.His resignation came as European Council president Donald Tusk announced an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on November 25th, at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations will be finalised and formalised.The pound plunged against both the euro and the dollar after Mr Raab resigned, fuelling a selloff in the British currency which was already struggling to gain traction.Ministers backed the deal on Wednesday night after a five-hour cabinet meeting which the prime minister described as impassioned, during which a number of the ministers spoke out against it.“The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop. But the collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration – this is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead,” Mrs May said after the meeting.The draft withdrawal agreement, running to 580 pages, seals the terms under which Britain leaves the EU. Its provisions, defining outstanding obligations and establishing a transition period in which both sides can adjust, range from iding up the common property, securing the rights of each others’ citizens and agreeing a departure bill for the UK.A protocol on Northern Ireland provides a backstop guarantee that will safeguard Ireland’s soft border, guarantees continued security co-operation, protects the Common Travel Area and safeguards both human rights and the 50 or so cross-Border programmes that have come out of the Belfast Agreement.Northern Ireland will remain in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, but will be subject to the EU customs code and to some EU regulations.Britain will not be able to end the backstop unilaterally, and its governance will fall under the same structure as the rest of the withdrawal agreement, with an arbitration panel made up of two representatives from Britain, two from the EU and one independent member.Conservative Brexiteers said on Wednesday night they would vote against the deal when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons, probably early next month. A number of backbench MPs said they were writing to the chairman of the 1922 Committee seeking a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.Mrs May acknowledged that she faced a struggle in seeking parliamentary approval for the deal, but she insisted that it represented the best available option.“I know that there will be difficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny, and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.“But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one with more ision, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.”In Brussels on Wednesday night, European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement represents “decisive progress”.In Dublin, the publication of the text was greeted by the Government as meeting all its essential requirements on the backstop, especially that it was not time-limited and it would not be possible under the terms of the treaty for the UK to unilaterally bring the backstop to an end.Speaking at Government Buildings on Wednesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was “one of the better days in politics”.Asked if the backstop in the draft treaty was “bulletproof” – the term he had used last December – Mr Varadkar said it was “even stronger than what we had back in December”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe deputy leader of the Democratic Union Party (DUP) Nigel Dodds has criticised prime minister Theresa May over the draft Brexit deal’s handling of Northern Ireland. Speaking in the House of Commons, he told MPs: “I could today stand here and take the prime minister through the list of promises and pledges she made to this house and to us, privately, about the future of Northern Ireland in the future relationship with the EU. “But I fear it would be a waste of time since she clearly doesn’t listen.” Mr Dodds, the DUP’s leader in Westminster, went on to praise the five ministers who quit on Thursday morning, saying: “The choice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom, that is the choice.”On Thursday morning a group of Northern Ireland politicians met the Taoiseach in Dublin to discuss the draft Brexit deal.Sinn Féin’s leader for Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill, SDLP leader Colm Eastwood, The Alliance Party’s Stephen Farry and Green Party leader Steven Agnew attended a joint meeting with Leo Varadkar .Outside Dublin’s government buildings, Mr Eastwood said difficult days lay ahead for prime minister Theresa May, but the group’s focus was on Northern Ireland.“We have to make sure the backstop is fully backed, and that’s what we’re focused on, protecting people across this island,” he said.“I think people should take some time to read the full implications of what this will mean.”Ms O’Neill said the group in Dublin represented the majority of Northern Ireland on a cross-community basis.“It’s a very fluid situation, and I think it’ll be a very interesting day.“For us, we want to remain in the customs union and the single market and we want protections for the Good Friday Agreement, our message is as consistent today as it was yesterday.”After the meeting Ms O’Neill said: “We have had a very positive meeting with Taoiseach and Tanaiste, a meeting where we were able to seek some assurances over what has been achieved in the agreement so far.“We set out as four pro-Remain parties with a common objective, in the first instance we speak for the majority in Northern Ireland, and we’re conscious that the DUP do not speak for the majority in the north.“We come at it from a number of basis, firstly that we need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, we need permanency in the backstop and no room for withdrawal from the British Government, and that has been achieved thus far.Mr Varadkar announced he would meet with the Northern Ireland parties on Wednesday night. However, the DUP and Ulster Unionist parties were not in attendance.The Taoiseach added that he had not spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster on Wednesday but said: “The door is always open and the phone is always on.”The DUP which is propping up British prime miniser Ms May’s government signalled it could not support a deal that included different conditions for Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom. On Wednesday night, DUP leader Arlene Foster told the media “we cannot have the fact that it would be the break-up of the union.”In the House of Commons on Thursday,What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland to the draft negotiated deal i? The News Letter’s Morning View described the deal as an “almost complete victory for Ireland and the European Union,” and a “complete climbdown” from Ms May. “The DUP cannot possibly support this capitulation — the effective impossibility of NI leaving the EU trade zone,” the Belfast paper, which takes a unionist perspective, stated. “Grim though the prospect of a Brexit no deal is, it is better than this agreement. But the deal will get through if enough Labour MPs back it, which will be a black day for the UK,” the Morning View leader said. Writing in The Belfast , Jane Morrice, former European Commission chief in Northern Ireland, said the backstop agreement, which would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs zone, “would mean the best of both worlds.”The backstop arrangement to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, which would ensure the same customs arrangements are maintained across the island, should be seen a “generous concession” to Northern Ireland, Ms Morrice wrote.“By possibly staying in the single market and the customs union, Northern Ireland could become the envy of the British Isles, attracting foreign direct investment from far and wide in its position as a gateway to Europe, the UK and the rest of the world” she wrote. The Irish News editorial said following the agreement it was beginning to dawn on the DUP that its relationship with the Conservative Party “would end in tears.”“Brexit was always going to be a disaster for all sections of our society and it is now dawning on the DUP that it will result in a catastrophe of historic proportions for unionism in particular,” the newspaper’s leader on Thursday stated. The Belfast newspaper takes a nationalist position . “None of this is going to turn out well for the DUP, and its ordinary members, including the slowest of learners in their ranks, must surely wish that they could turn the clock back and reverse their approach to the 2016 poll,” the editorial said. The reaction of both Sinn Féin and the SDLP centred around repeated calls that it was key the withdrawal conditions included a backstop against a hard border being put up between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On Thursday morning, Northern Irish political columnist Newton Emerson tweeted: “For the first time since the referendum, I think it’s possible Brexit may not happen. But still very, very unlikely.” According to the agreement released on Wednesday night, a protocol on Northern Ireland provides a backstop guarantee that will safeguard Ireland’s soft border, guarantees continued security co-operation, protects the Common Travel Area and safeguards both human rights and the 50 or so cross-Border programmes that have come out of the Belfast Agreement.Northern Ireland will remain in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, but will be subject to the EU customs code and to some EU regulations.–Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom,RECALLING that the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union presents a significant and unique challenge to the island of Ireland, and reaffirming that the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process will remain of paramount importance to peace, stability and reconciliation there,RECOGNISING that it is necessary to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland through a unique solution in order to ensure the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union,RECALLING that the Withdrawal Agreement, which is based on Article 50 TEU, does not aim at establishing a permanent future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom,RECALLING the Union’s and the United Kingdom’s intention to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footingHAVING REGARD to the Union and to the United Kingdom’s common objective of a close future relationship, which will establish ambitious customs arrangements that build on the single customs territory provided for in this Protocol, in full respect of their respective legal orders,AFFIRMING that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement of 10 April 1998 between the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of Ireland and the other participants in the multi-party negotiations (the “1998 Agreement”), which is annexed to the British-Irish Agreement of the same date (the “British-Irish Agreement”), including its subsequent implementation agreements and arrangements, should be protected in all its parts,RECOGNISING that cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland is a central part of the 1998 Agreement and is essential for achieving reconciliation and the normalisation of relationships on the island of Ireland, and recalling the roles, functions and safeguards

phase 1 of negotiations under Article 50 TEU on the United Kingdom’s orderly withdrawal from the European Union of 8 December 2017 outlines three different scenarios for protecting North-South cooperation and avoiding a hard border, but that this Protocol is based on the third scenario of maintaining full alignment with those rules of the Union’s internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement, to apply unless and until an alternative arrangement implementing another

Protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities both in Ireland and Northern Ireland,MINDFUL that the rights and obligations of Ireland under the rules of the Union’s internal market and customs union must be fully respected,HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (“Withdrawal Agreement”):Objectives and relationship to subsequent agreement1. This Protocol is without prejudice to the provisions of the 1998 Agreement regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent, which provides that any change in that status can only be made with the consent of a majority of its people.2. This Protocol respects the essential State functions and territorial integrity of the United Kingdom.3. This Protocol sets out arrangements necessary to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South cooperation, avoid a hard border and protect the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions.4. The objective of the Withdrawal Agreement is not to establish a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom. The provisions of this Protocol are therefore intended to apply only temporarily, taking into account the commitments of the Parties set out in Article 2(1). The provisions of this Protocol shall apply unless and until they are superseded, in whole or in part, by a subsequent agreement.1. The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude, by 31 December 2020, an agreement which supersedes this Protocol in whole or in part.2. Any subsequent agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom shall indicate the parts of this Protocol which it supersedes. Once a subsequent agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom becomes applicable after the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement, this Protocol shall then, from the date of application of such subsequent agreement and in accordance with the provisions of that agreement setting out the effect of that agreement on this Protocol, not apply or shall cease to apply, as the case may be, in whole or in part, notwithstanding Article 20.Extension of the transition period The United Kingdom, having had regard to progress made towards conclusion of the agreement referred to in Articles 1(4) and 2(1) of this Protocol, may at any time before 1 July 2020 request the extension of the transition period referred to in Article 126 of the Withdrawal Agreement.

The United Kingdom shall ensure that no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in that part of the 1998 Agreement entitled Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity results from its withdrawal from the Union, including in the area of protection against discrimination as enshrined in the provisions of Union law listed in Annex 1 to this Protocol, and shall implement this paragraph through dedicated mechanisms.2. The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.1. The United Kingdom and Ireland may continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories (the “Common Travel Area”), while fully respecting the rights of natural persons conferred by Union law.2. The United Kingdom shall ensure that the Common Travel Area and the associated rights and privileges can continue to apply without affecting the obligations of Ireland under Union law, in particular with respect to free movement for Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of their nationality, to, from and within Ireland.Single customs territory, movement of goods1. Until the future relationship becomes applicable, a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom shall be established (“the single customs territory”).

With a view to ensuring the maintenance of the level playing field conditions required for the proper functioning of this paragraph, the provisions set out in Annex 4 to this Protocol shall apply. Where appropriate, the Joint Committee may modify Annex 4 in order to lay down higher standards for these level playing field conditions.The Joint Committee shall adopt before 1 July 2020 the detailed rules relating to trade in goods between the two parts of the single customs territory for the implementation of this paragraph. In the absence of such a decision adopted before 1 July 2020, Annex 3 shall apply.By derogation from the third subparagraph, fishery and aquaculture products, as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 13792013 (“fishery and aquaculture products”), shall not be covered by the rules set out in Annexes 2 and 4, as well as the rules referred to in the fourth subparagraph, unless an agreement on access to waters and fishing opportunities is applicable between the Union and the United Kingdom. In accordance with Article 184 of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify such an agreement before 1 July 2020.The Joint Committee may adopt decisions amending Annex 3 to this Protocol, where such amendments are necessary for the proper functioning of this paragraph.

He is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games.The minister made the admission at a parliamentary committee meeting on Wednesday when asked by an opposition lawmaker if he was computer literate.“I’ve been independent since I was 25 and have always directed my staff and secretaries to do that kind of thing,” Mr Sakurada replied. “I’ve never used a computer!”Mr Sakurada had said that he recognised that “firmly carrying out cybersecurity from a citizen’s standpoint” was part of his job.When asked by the lawmaker how someone lacking computer skills could be in charge of cybersecurity, Mr Sakurada said policy was decided broadly by a number of people in his office and the national government, and he was confident there would be no problems.Mr Sakurada’s responses in parliament and news conferences have drawn criticism before. Addressing another parliamentary committee, the minister had slipped up by saying the Olympics would cost Japan 1,500 yen (€11.66) instead of 150 billion yen (€1.17 billion).He has blamed his mistakes on the opposition not submitting questions in advance, although they had, and during news conferences for the Olympics he has often simply answered: “I don’t know.” – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Country\u0026rsquos top prosecutor recommends punishment for five charged with journalist killingBook author notes how much jihadism evolved between 911 and the 2015 Bataclan attacksMove leaves government led by Binyamin Netanyahu with wafer-thin majorityBoth sides agree to \u0026lsquomeet quiet with quiet\u0026rsquo after most serious escalation since 2014 warThree Palestinians killed in air raids as Israeli forces respond to rocket barragePressure mounts on White House to take action against those linked to the killingViolence comes as Israel and Hamas seemed to be progressing towards calming conflictDiscussions between Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels were due to begin this monthThe roots of the catastrophic violence in the country date back to failures in 2011Critics of the Saudi campaign have long questioned US involvement in the warIsrael backs Qatar\u0026rsquos initial payment as part of plan to end border violenceApproval for success of Muslim women, and for Democrats taking House of RepresentativesCharges relate to $2bn sale of German Thyssenkrupp submarines to IsraelSaudi-led coalition launches punishing wave of air strikes against Houthi rebelsGraves contain remains of thousands of people believed to have been killed by jihadistsTrump administration slaps penalties on 700 targets in oil and financial sectorsCourt accused of \u0026lsquotravesty of justice\u0026rsquo after ruling the trio gave information to QatarUS has failed to reassert domination over Iran since Islamic Revolution, claims KhameneiAmal Hussain (7), suffering from severe malnourishment, dies at refugee campAnalysis: Washington offer is not even-handed and invites Saudis to expand offensive"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3698722.1542282713!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may sparks laughter as she insists deal allows smooth and orderly brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May leaves 10 Downing Street, to make a statement in the House of Commons on Thursday. Photograph: Peter NichollReuersTheresa May has insisted the UK has clinched a bespoke Brexit deal that is better than any other model, but admitted that “difficult choices” had been made, which triggered the exit of cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey.In a plea to MPs to back her, she said that delivering the deal was “in the national interest” and that any move by MPs to block the deal would take negotiators “back to square one, more uncertainty, more ision”.“The British people want us to get this done,” Mrs May said. “To get on with addressing the other issues they care about. The choice is clear, we can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.”Mrs May told the Commons she respected the views of the two cabinet ministers who quit on Thursday morning and said they had differences of opinion. Two other key cabinet Brexiteers, Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, who had been said to have serious reservations, were sitting beside her on the government benches.Mrs May said her deal “delivers in ways that many said simply could not be done”.She said: “We were told that we had a binary choice between the model of Norway or the model of Canada, that we could not have a bespoke deal. But the outline political declaration sets out an arrangement that is better for our country than both of these.”In the speech, Mr May defended her “insurance policy” of a backstop to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.“I do not pretend that this has been a comfortable process, or that either we or the EU are entirely happy with all of the arrangements that have been included within it. But of course this is the case,” she said. “This is an arrangement that we have both said we never want to have to use.“But while some people might pretend otherwise, there is no deal which delivers the Brexit deal the British people voted for which does not involve this insurance policy.”Mrs May said it would ensure the UK leaves “in a smooth and orderly way”, to peals of laughter from MPs in the House of Commons. She said many had told her there was “no blueprint for Brexit” and others had questioned whether separation was even possible.She said Brexit had forced the UK to “confront some very difficult issues” but said that “a good Brexit, in the national interest”, was possible. “We have persevered and made a decisive breakthrough,” she said.Responding to Mrs May, Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was “a huge and damaging failure”. The Labour party leader said: “After two years of bungled negotiations the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister’s own red lines and does not meet our six tests.“The government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say.”He cited the departure of Mr Raab as Brexit secretary over a deal he had negotiated. Mr Corbyn said: “What faith does that give anyone else, in this place or in the country?”He called for the government’s legal advice on the risks of a no-deal Brexit to be published, saying: “We cannot put to parliament this half-baked deal that both the Brexit secretary and his predecessor had reject. The DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds criticised Ms May over her deal’s handling of Northern Ireland. He told MPs: “I could today stand here and take the prime minister through the list of promises and pledges she made to this house and to us, privately, about the future of Northern Ireland in the future relationship with the EU. “But I fear it would be a waste of time since she clearly doesn’t listen.” Mr Dodds, the DUP’s leader in Westminster, went on to praise the five ministers who quit on Thursday morning, saying: “The choice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom, that is the choice.” -  ServiceDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

His research has helped to confirm them as the only known Michelangelo bronzes in existence.“Being an observant person, both as a doctor and a scientist, I noticed that the toes on the bronzes were a bit odd,” he said.“I then went and had a look at all the toes that I could find anywhere in Michelangelo’s oeuvre. Out of 40 toes, all except for two fitted this brief: they had a short big toe and a long second toe, and the big toe goes outwards - it looks like someone is wearing a flip-flop in between the toes.“In the Sistine Chapel, David, Moses, they all have the same toes. There are certain traits that shine through in an artist’s work.”Prof Abrahams, who combines his work at Warwick Medical School with a keen interest in art history, says he can now instantly tell a real Michelangelo foot from a fake.The Michelangelo toe is abducted - facing away from the other toes to leave a noticeable gapHe also found other physical clues to link the bronzes to Michelangelo. The two men - one young, one older and bearded - have rippled torsos. “We all know a six-pack, but these guys actually have an eight-pack,” he said, something seen in very few people. “I found two statues and five Michelangelo drawings that have that same, rare anomaly, which tells me that the model he used for those was the same model he used for these bronzes.“They look slightly on steroids, slightly pumped up, like bodybuilders. But if you were a guy lifting masonry stone you would have very developed muscles.”Another indicator was the presence of the sartorius muscle in the legs. The muscle is not outwardly visible, leading Prof Abrahams to conclude that only an artist who had dissected bodies would know of its existence.When Prof Abrahams was told that the bronzes likely dated to the early 1500s, he was surprised. “The first anatomy textbook was written in 1543 - we’re talking a generation later. So whoever made these beautiful bronzes had actually seen under the skin.”He narrowed down to less than a dozen a list of artists known to have dissected bodies, and concluded that their work did not match the bronzes.The statues “took my breath away”, Prof Abrahams said. “Of course, they’re beautiful, but what I’m talking about is anatomical, scientific accuracy.”Another factor was the pubic hair. Almost every male classical and Renaissance sculpture has pubic hair arranged “in a triangle going down towards the genitalia”, he explained. In Michelangelo’s work, “the triangle goes up towards the umbilicus, not the other way around”.The \u0026#39eight-pack\u0026#39 is another hallmark of Michelangelo sculpture, according to Prof AbrahamsProf Abrahamson’s evidence is featured in a new book, Michelangelo: Sculptor in Bronze, which draws together the work of various experts.The bronzes were first recorded as being the work of Michelangelo in 1878, when they were owned by the Rothschild family, but the attribution was later in doubt. They last changed hands at Sotheby’s in 2002 for £1.65 million, when they were bought by a private collector, and remain known as the \u0027Rothschild bronzes\u0027.A team from Cambridge University and the Fitzwilliam reattributed them to Michelangelo in 2015 and invited experts from various disciplines to contribute further research, which has now confirmed their findings.They commissioned technical analysis at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam which found that the bronzes date from the early 1500s.The book also details 30 little-known letters from Michelangelo to his family, written in 1506-08, in which he writes about working in bronze. He is known to have made three major bronze sculptures, none of which survive.Dr Eike Schmidt, director of the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, described the research as a “game-changer”. He said: “It provides a completely new - and indeed long overdue - interdisciplinary approach to Michelangelo studies.“It proves what can be achieved when there is genuine collaboration between internationally-regarded experts in fields as erse as art history, conservation science, anatomy and technical archaeology.”‘We have been betrayed and will never forgive you’: Readers react to Theresa May’s Brexit deal Brexit deal latest news: Four ministers quit as Jacob Rees-Mogg prepares to send letter of no confidence in PM Fruit machines routinely being played by children in pubs, warns Gambling CommissionQueen leads tributes to Prince Charles at glittering palace partyJohn Lewis Christmas advert: Watch Elton John learn to play piano in heartwarming videoTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - read in fullJacob Rees-Mogg to submit letter of no confidence today after he challenges Theresa May in Commons1922 committee: how backbench MPs could force a vote of no confidence in Theresa MayFive Saudi officials face death penalty over Khashoggi murder, Riyadh prosecutor says, as Crown Prince is exonerated The \u0026#39Leonardo da Vinci of diamonds\u0026#39 sells for world record $50mLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Nomos was established in Glashütte in 1990 by Roland\u0026nbspSchwertner, a fashion photographer and computer scientist from West Germany, and now employs 300 people from 20 nations.Italy far-right government offers land to parents who have third childFar-right parties overtake Macron for first time in France pollMI5 agents to take lead in fight against far-right extremism“Glashütte as we know it today would simply not have been possible without the reunification of Germany, and without the freedom and democracy that brought,” says Uwe Ahrendt, chief executive. “Furthermore, we have employees that need our protection those that the far right would claim \u0027don’t belong here\u0027. But we know that they do.”Ahrendt became the chief executive of\u0026nbspNomos in 2000. The company was shocked to discover\u0026nbspthat in the 2017 federal elections, over a third of Glashütte residents had voted for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u0026nbspSince spring 2018, Nomos has worked with Open Saxony, a Government-funded programme, to provide free workshops and training to its employees where they\u0026nbspcheck the accuracy of right-wing views and provide emotional support to staff. Ahrendt says: “We realised that we need to position ourselves clearly and publicly in support of our democratic political system.”Glashütte in East Germany is known as mini-Switzerland for its thriving watchmaking industry (Courtesy Photo)German businesses have another good reason embrace ersity: the country will be short of 3 million workers by 2020, according to a 2017 report by Prognos, an economic research institute, worsening to a shortage of 3.3 million by 2040 as the native population ages.\u0026nbspSkilled migrants are being seen as a way to plug the gaps. A new immigration law, introduced on October 2, aims to attract more workers from countries outside the EU. Steffen Kampeter, chief executive of the Confederation of German Employers\u0027 Associations has said Germany’s international competitiveness depends upon “qualified workers from abroad”.The state is funding efforts to improve ersity in German businesses who may not have considered hiring migrants in the past. At a recent meeting organised by Netzwerk Courage, a network that promotes democracy, business leaders, trade union representatives and groups working with migrants came together to discuss how they can improve ersity in East German businesses.Petra Köpping, the minister for integration in Saxony, said that for years, East Germany has not worked towards making the workforce more erse. Over time, it has fallen behind. Now it needs to work even harder to catch up. Petra Köpping herself employs 45 staff – 18 of which come from overseas.Marlis Straessner-Lacroix\u0026nbspis from the organisation Willkommon in Lobtau, which has been helping asylum seekers in the Lobtau district of Dresden since 2014. She said that in many cases, businesses show a lack of interest in employing migrants, even when approached by organisations who have the resources to help.Nomos employs 300 people from 20 nations (Courtesy Photo)Glashütte is not your average East German town. It exports tens of thousands of luxury watches every year from 10 high-end watchmakers, some of which sell timepieces for millions of pounds. The industry started in the mid-1800s, when Ferdinand Adolph Lange enlisted financial support from local nobility to start manufacturing watches as means to employ impoverished local people.Like all East Germany industries, Glashütte\u0027s watch factories were taken over by\u0026nbspthe Soviet-supported East German state after the Second World War. When this regime collapsed, many workers fled to the West. Whole towns were hollowed out. Glashütte was revived in part by incomers like Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand, who returned from the West to revive old brands alongside new ones, like Nomos.Many other East German towns never experienced the same renaissance. Even today, East Germans are still paid less than West Germans and work longer hours. The average annual gross wage in the former East German states is €30,172, almost €5,000 less than in states in the former West Germany, according to official data provided to\u0026nbspthe socialist Left party.For some, a sense of injustice has hardened into a fear of the outsider since Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed migrants to Germany in 2015. Ahrendt says far-right riots in the nearby town of Chemnitz\u0026nbspin August\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspmade the company’s efforts to promote democracy seem even more essential: “We wanted to set a precedent, because an intolerant, racist atmosphere will not be permitted at Nomos\u0026nbspGlashütte.”Some businesses and organisations have reported that since the AfD has gained more support in elections, the number of applicants from overseas has decreased. Dr Michael Genkin, the leader of a visitors programme that welcomes international scientists to the Max Planck research institute in Dresden, says that after 2015, Saxony became less attractive for workers of all kinds. “We indeed had the impression of a decreasing number of applicants at our institute around the time of those political developments in Saxony, and in Dresden specifically,” he says, noting that the number of applicants was too small to draw a statistical conclusion.Ahrendt says events in Chemnitz and elsewhere have shown the world a darker side to German politics that it is up to responsible businesses to counter.“My company is concerned about this image,” he says. “We want to show that there is a brighter side to Germany, especially in Saxony. When you are close by, Chemnitz is just a little place in Germany but when you are far away, it represents all of Germany.”10 best watches for menThe workshops at Nomos are booked out until the end of the year. “That is great news, especially since they are voluntary and take place within work hours,” Ahrendt says. “From our point of view, everyone should work to protect freedom and democracy—and perhaps even more so in Saxony, since it was something that we fought for in 1989.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have created a high-ranking committee to examine all the risks, including those raised by the IMF and the US Treasury, and those discussed during the public hearings on the legislation.The issues laid out by the IMF include reputational\u0026nbsprisks and a danger of losing its correspondent banking relationship (CBR) with the US dollar.Given these sorts of issues, the authorities expect it will take a few years to issue the cryptocurrency, the IMF report concluded.Moreover, they will only issue the SOV\u0026nbsponce its use complies with the FATF\u0026nbsp(Financial Action Task Force) standard and US regulation, and once its use in transactions in the US financial system has been approved by the US government.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. Dumbo\u0026nbspmarks the latest classic animated movie to be re-made as a live-action movie, following in the success of\u0026nbspThe Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, and\u0026nbspAlice in Wonderland. Future adaptations include\u0026nbspAladdin,\u0026nbspThe Lion King, and\u0026nbspThe Little Mermaid.\u0026nbspThe original\u0026nbspDumbo\u0026nbspwas released back in 1941 and won the Oscar for for best scoring of a musical picture.

Meanwhile, Germany has more than doubled its number of institutions in the top 150.Experts say the international outlook of Asian universities-\u0026nbsp and the increased use of the English language in universities in other countries - are key factors for the UK’s decline.\u0026nbspFirms increasingly cite East Asian institutions as top producers of workplace-ready graduates. South Korea has leapt from one university in the top 150 in 2011 to six this year, the report says.Simon Baker, data editor at THE, said: “The new data analysis reveals a substantial global shift in graduate employability this decade. We see a dramatically improved performance within East Asia and parts of Europe.\u0026nbsp“By-and-large, the highest risers are those equipping students with softer skills increasingly favoured among recruiters, such as teamwork –combined with the strongest possible industry experience.”He added: “In contrast, we can also track the extent of the decline since 2011 among traditionally dominant countries like the US and UK.\u0026nbsp“The increasingly international outlook of Asian universities, as well as the use of English becoming more widespread – removing a natural competitive advantage of the UK and US – have been two key factors behind this.”Created with Sketch.Best Universities for Life Sciences and Medicine Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “As the recent CBIPearson report shows, the demand for UK graduates by UK employers is still strong, and continues to grow.”\u0026nbspBut he added: “It is clear that to maintain our world leading position we must start matching our competitors’ increased investment in higher education.\u0026nbsp“Rumours of a cut in tuition fees, together with the impact of Brexit on research funding, and uncertainty over the status of international staff and students, risk putting the global reputation of our universities at risk.”Number of universities included in 2018 rankingNumber of universities included in 2011 rankingShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This sand was transported by the glacier from the bottom of the impact crater to the ice margin, and it has yielded a wealth of information on the impact (Svend Funder)“While it requires more research, we consider it possible that the Cape York irons may have been outer fragments or even boulders on the surface of the main meteorite.\u0026nbspWe suspect these initially detached in Earth’s gravity field and then decelerated as they entered the atmosphere to fall south of the Hiawatha crater.”Professor Kurt H\u0026nbspKjær, lead author of the research\u0026nbspfrom the Natural History Museum of Denmark, said: “The crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising, because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact.“The next step in the investigation will be to confidently date the impact.\u0026nbspThis will be a challenge because it will probably require recovering material that melted during the impact from the bottom of the structure, but this is crucial if we are to understand how the Hiawatha impact affected life on Earth.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The precision of new measurements continues to improve, opening the doors to new parameters of space, such as super-Earth planets in cool orbits like Barnard\u0027s star b.The scientists want to collect more data to confirm the planet’s presence, and say it could provide an excellent target to test using the latest in space observation technology such as\u0026nbspNasa’s planned Wide Field Infra Red Survey Telescope.If using such technologies they can observe the planet directly, it will open up their understanding of the kinds of planets that are forming around other stars in distant space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Child added: And I want all those readers who were upset about Tom Cruise to help me out – participate in choosing the right actor for the TV series. We\u0027re rebooting and starting over and we\u0027re going to try and find the perfect guy.Cruise made his debut as Reacher in 2012, in the film directed and adapted by Christopher McQuarrie. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, and made £218m at the global box office. However, the sequel –\u0026nbspJack Reacher: Never Go Back –\u0026nbspgrossed $162m and received mixed reviews.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest, and I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom, said the Prime Minister.                \u0026lsquoDECISIVE PROGRESS\u0027 Jean-Claude Juncker speaks on May\u0027s Brexit dealCabinet insiders said around 10 ministers raised deep misgivings about the deal, with the final decision to back the deal being far from unanimous.And despite her success in persuading her Cabinet to back her plans, Mrs May yesterday faced a growing revolt among Tory MPs.Some backbenchers warned of a fresh attempt to try to oust her from office, demanding a vote of confidence in her leadership within days.Mrs May also faced a showdown with Arlene Foster, leader of her parliamentary allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, over the potential impact of the deal on Northern Ireland.Threatening to end their parliamentary alliance, Mrs Foster said of the deal: Of course there will be consequences. We could not as Unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom.In her statement outside the front door of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had completed a long, detailed and impassioned debate on the draft withdrawal agreement and a declaration on a future trade relationship between Britain and the EU and come to a collective agreement.I firmly believe that the draft Withdrawal Agreement was the best that could be negotiated, and it was for the Cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks, she said.Brexit news: Theresa May has finally secured the support of the Cabinet for her exit deal (Image: )With angry shouts from anti-Brexit protesters heard in the background, the Prime Minister admitted her Cabinet had faced difficult choices, particularly over the so-called Northern Ireland backstop insurance policy to avoid a hard border with the Irish republic.She said: The collective decision of Cabinet was that the Government should agree the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the Outline Political DeclarationThis is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead.These decisions were not taken lightly - but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear.This deal which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders ends free movement protects jobs, security and our union or leave with no deal - or no Brexit at all.Looking ahead to the Commons battle over the deal, she added: I know that there will be difficult days ahead.This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one with more ision, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.It is my job as Prime Minister to explain the decisions that the Government has taken and I stand ready to do that beginning tomorrow with a statement in Parliament.Brexit news: Theresa May leaving Downing Street to address the press (Image: PA)Soon after her statement, the Government published the 585-page withdrawal agreement and seven-page future relationship declaration last night.Senior Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg led criticism of the deal last night. In a letter to fellow Tory MPs, the chairman of the backbench European Research Group wrote: The proposed agreement will see the UK hand over \u0026pound39 billion to the EU for little or nothing in return.He said the deal was unacceptable to unionists, will lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws and is profoundly undemocratic.For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in Parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise, he said.One senior MP said anger was so intense among backbenchers that a call for a vote of no-confidence could be made today.Other backbenchers claimed fresh letters were being sent to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, in an attempt to trigger the confidence vote.Other Tories threatened to a coup against her leadership.Benjamin Harris-Quinney, of the centre-right Tory Bow Group, said: If you are an MP who cannot support Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, such is its significance, you surely cannot continue to support her Premiership.But support for the deal was sounded by the British Chambers of Commerce business group.Brexit news: Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal has been slated by rivals (Image: )Director general Adam Marshall said: \u0026ldquoBusinesses will recognise the huge efforts made by the Prime Minister and across government to reach this milestone.He added: \u0026ldquoAfter two and half years of uncertainty, this may be end of the beginning \u0026mdash but not yet the beginning of the end.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit coordinator, said: We welcome the positive progress made in the negotiations by Michel Barnier and his team, who have consistently fought for the interests of the European Union.He added: This deal is a milestone towards a credible and sustainable future relationship between the EU and the UK.Amid angry exchanges during the Cabinet meeting, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, a leading Leave campaigner, repeatedly pleaded for MPs and ministers to be given a free vote on the deal in the Commons.Cabinet sources said Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey pressed the Prime Minister for a recorded vote of the final decision and became emotional when her plea was rejected.

But in what is considered largely as a victory by Brussels and Downing Street, Mrs May has secured a UK-wide Irish backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The mechanism became Brexit\u0026rsquos most vexed issue because the EU\u0026rsquos own plan was used as the building blocks for what was agreed by the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe advisor Olly Robbins and his European Commission counterparts Michel Barnier and Sabine Weyand. After proclaiming \u0026ldquono British Prime Minister could accept the terms set out by Brussels, which would have essentially kept Northern Ireland locked in the EU\u0026rsquos customs union and single market for goods, Mrs May has now agreed a UK-wide approach to the backstop.                Brexit news: Customs union membership is now \u0027basis for the future\u0027                Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?When does the Irish backstop come into force?The mechanism will now take shape in the withdrawal agreement as a UK-wide customs union arrangement.This temporary insurance policy will come into force \u0026ldquounless and until a permanent solution to prevent a hard Irish border is found jointly by Brussels and Westminster.Because of the toxicity in the backstop, negotiators have included a review mechanism to avoid it ever being triggered.In July 2020, officials from both sides will come together to make a decision of how to proceed using three potential options.They will either say a UK-EU free trade agreement that avoids a hard Irish border has been agreed and the backstop is no longer needed, if a solution is within reach they can extend the 21-month transition period to allow more time for talks and finally, if all else fails, the backstop will be triggered.Brexit news: Theresa May agrees deal with EU and now must convince her Cabinet (Image: )Will the UK be chained to Brussels forever?Fearful Brexiteers believe accepting a UK-wide customs backstop with no \u0026ldquoindependent review mechanism allows Brussels to essentially keep Britain locked in a start of constant limbo.Under the terms of the UK-wide backstop, Britain would be in a customs union with Brussels and therefore have to follow EU trade rules and be unable to sign independent trade deals in order to maintain a frictionless border.The rumoured backstop agreement can be described as a swimming pool \u0026ndash Great Britain would be in the shallow end while Northern Ireland is in the deep.The EU has insisted the original Northern Ireland-specific backstop is buried deep within the 500-page withdrawal agreement.In theory, this means if the UK Government grows sick of following EU trade rules and customs union membership it could remove Great Britain from backstop but the ultimate fallback would come into play and Northern Ireland would remain solely in the EU\u0026rsquos customs arrangement and single market for goods \u0026ndash creating a border in the Irish Sea.                What is the Brexit backstop? Has Northern Ireland been split from UK?                 Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?Does this mean the European Court of Justice will have influence in Britain?Ultimately, the ECJ will be the final arbiter on issues involving EU law that may arise from the Irish backstop agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has discussed a \u0026ldquojoint arbitration panel to break any future impasse during review negotiations surrounding the backstop.But EU officials believe such panels are not allowed to settle political disputes of this nature and have therefore ensured that the ECJ will play a major role overseeing EU law in Northern Ireland.Questions of interpreting EU law can only be settled by the ECJ, which will leave the Luxembourg-based courts with an important role to play in the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the backstop.Could the backstop become the future trading deal?Alongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement came the publication of a seven-page outline on the political declaration that commits both sides to combining deep regulatory and customs cooperations, building on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement.This proclaims that both sides will use the single customs territory \u0026ndash the UK-wide backstop \u0026ndash as the basis for a future relationship.The political declaration says both sides have commit to combining deep regulatory and customs cooperations, building on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement.After its publication, Mr Barnier said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore drawing the basis for an ambitious partnership which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs cooperation in depth and with a \u0026lsquolevel playing field\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoOur objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we\u0026rsquore proposing in the withdrawal agreement, a single customs territory.\u0026ldquoThere will be no tariffs on goods and indeed it is legitimate for that proposal to be flanked by a level playing field that\u0026rsquos a voluntary deliberate agreement between two parties who respect each other. This agreement offers a basis for future negotiations and that is in our common interest.

Mrs Braverman tweeted her resignation letter at 10.22am on Thursday morning. She tweeted the letter with the statement: It is with deep regret and after reflection that I have had to tender my resignation today as a Brexit Minister.                Brexit news: Who is Esther McVey? Why has she quit? Resignation letterThank you for the opportunity.I look forward to working to support Brexit from the Backbenches. This has not been an easy decision.\u0026nbspMrs Braverman\u0026nbspsaid the proposed Northern Ireland backstop is not what the British people voted for, and inssisted it threatened to break up the United Kingdom.Her letter read: Dear Prime Minister,Ms Braverman quit shortly after her boss Dominic Raab left office (Image: )This is a difficult letter to write. One which I never expected to compose. It has been an immense honour to support you in delivering the historic opportunity of leaving the EU as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union.It has, in many ways, been a dream job which I have enjoyed tremendously. However, despite my strenuous attempts, I now find myself unable to sincerely support the deal agreed yesterday by Cabinet. It is therefore with deep regret that I tender my resignation.My reasons are simple. Firstly, the proposed Northern Ireland Backstop is not Brexit. It is not what the British people - or my constituents - voted for in 2016.It prevents an unequivocal exit from a customs union with the EU. This robs the UK of the main competitive advantages from Brexit. Without a unilateral right to terminate or a definite time limit to the Backstop, our numerous promises to leave the customs union will not be honoured.Mrs Braverman quit her position shortly after her former boss Dominic Raab (Image: TWITTERSUELLABRAVERMANMP)17.4 million people voted for the UK to leave the EU in our own sovereign way and at a time of our choosing. The Backstop renders this impossible and generations of people will see this as betrayal.Secondly, the Backstop proposals set out different regulatory regimes for Northern Ireland and Great Britain threatening to break up our precious Union. I am confident - having met with customs professionals in my role at the Department - that this could have been avoided.Throughout this process, I have compromised. I have put pragmatism ahead of idealism and understand that concessions are necessary in a negotiation. I have kept faith in the ultimate destination to justify an uncomfortable journey.However I have reached a point where I feel that these concessions do not respect the will of the people - the people who put us here and whom we humbly serve. We must not let them down.Mr Raab quit in protest of Mrs May\u0027s new draft porposal (Image: )I thoroughly enjoyed working at the Department and have been supported by excellent civil servants. To them, I am grateful.Thank you for the opportunity. I have immense respect for the way in which you have conducted yourself during these very difficult times.I know how extremely hard you have worked to serve our national interest.I look forward to working to deliver Brexit in the best possible way from the Backbenches.Her resignation comes as another blow to Mrs May\u0027s cabinet, which has so far seen a handful of resignations.Many commentators are seeing the resignations as a threat to Mrs May\u0027s grip on leadership.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab - who only took over in the summer after David Davis resigned in protest over the Prime Minister\u0027s withdrawal strategy - said he cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU.Esther McVey announced she was resigning as Work and Pensions Secretary as she could not defend a deal which meant the UK handing over control to the EU.

It also marks yet another hurdle in the plan from the European Union and Britain to untangle their WTO commitments post-Brexit, increasing the likelihood of a huge showdown at the global trade body. The document, obtained by Bloomberg and discussed at a WTO meeting in Geneva on Monday, was signed by Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Taiwan, Thailand, the US and Uruguay.

leaders in November, .That could mean Labours Jeremy Corbyn is whisked into Downing Street.Heres the latest odds from Ladbrokes.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.He drew a huge crowd to hear him bash Theresa Mays Brexit plans in a barnstorming speech at the Tory conference in Birmingham.Boris quit as Foreign Secretary on July  in a killer blow to Mays government.He walked out just hours after she lost Brexit Secretary David Davis over her Chequers plan to keep close ties to Brussels.But many MPs appear to have turned against him, meaning he might struggle to get on the ballot.His aborted leadership bid in  was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.And his hopes could be dashed by reports of a close friendship with a blonde Tory aide and his orce from we Marina.The bookies have recently been giving Jeremy Corbyn strong odds as the nations most likely next Prime Minister.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected  General Election when Labour picked up  seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Although the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, Labour is enjoying relatively strong support in opinion polls.He hopes to force a general election by voting down Mrs Mays Brexit deal, and has boasted he would win.The Home Secretary is the current bookies favourite among the Conservatives.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Some of his statements in recent months and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.The former Brexit secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment was welcomed by Leave-backing MPs.But his former personal assistant branded him a bullying Mr Nasty after she was sacked for leading a double le as an escort.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.David Davis quit as Brexit secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories have demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Davis was rated as a   outsider but his odds have recently dropped.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has won a huge public profile despite not being a minister and is loved by Tory activists.Rees-Mogg has also garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit while a number of cabinet ministers resigned on November , , over her soft orce deal with the EU.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border","story":"Heres our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.Mrs May wants the UK to have the right to end the backstop at will - but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was trying to get to escape to Turkey,” recalls Havel Ronnie.But here is signicant numbers of other foreigners here too - not just British – but many of the top leadership, who are Saudi, Chechen or Iraqi.”ISISs so-called caliphate has been left virtually decimated since they lost their de-facto capital, Raqqa, in Syria last year.However, according to the Havel Ronnie in and around Hajin the bloodthirsty group still control around  square kilometers of villages spotted along the Euphrates river and dislodging them will be extremely dficult.“ISIS have had over five years to prepare, and they have built tunnels and placed IED everywhere… they also know the terrain very well,” he states.“It is very slow work [and] we are having to take it, house by house, metre by metre.”The American-backed coalition recently suffered a major setback last month after the extremists launched a series of counter attacks using the cover of sandstorms.“The sandstorm lasted for almost three days and we could only see meters in front of us,” a female commander explains of that attack.Luckily they suffered no losses at that base, but it was almost over run by the jihadists.Some of those involved in the assault were also foreign fighters.“We captured a Saudi and Afghani…and my [female] comrade shot a blonde European man in the head,” she states pointing near to the ISIS vehicle, where it happened.“He was about to enter our base and explode his suicide vest.”The SDF have recently redeployed some of their elite ‘counter terrorism units to Hajin to bolster their troops in the area.“We will begin the offensive against Hajin soon...but I don’t think this battle will be done quickly” the chief commander explains.“This is not a war that can be won quickly,” he added.Eventhe jihadists do lose Hajin this commander does not believe it will be the end of the terror group.“I am certain that they will be defeated here, but, that will not be the end of ISIS... and what may come after maybe worse, he adds.According to him this is a generational battle which cannot be defeated just by retaking territory.“At least now we and you know where ISIS is but after they are gone, they could attack from anywhere, even in Europe,” he says.In August Baghdadi urged his followers to unleash suicide bombs in the West, just days after he was reported to be brain dead.In the recorded message the worlds most wanted man urged fanatics to follow the striking lions behind recent lone wolf attacks in Europe and Canada."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449416601.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"obese children given electric bikes conwy county","story":"Conwy Council in North Wales says it wants to help kids with weight management dficulties engage in sport.A pilot scheme involving  local youngsters last year showed overweight children struggled to ride up hills using normal bicycles.And leisure chiefs say the motorised bikes - which use batteries to ease pedalling - will help fat children move around dficult terrain.A report found that a third of all schoolchildren in the borough are overweight.The council was asked to match £, in private funding to pay for five so-called e-bikes after a pilot scheme with a local school.If successful, the cash will be provided by EU funding.The council report said: Having run a pilot scheme on a smaller scale within a local school using traditional bicycles, the evidence was clear that e-bikes can help those with weight management dficulties to engage in sport.Using the bike as a tool to experience the outdoors without the e-bike would not have the ability to ride up hills thus making it more accessible and enjoyable.Other benefits include less time on video games and social media s.Long term goals include making the transition on to traditional cycling and long lasting health benefits including a lower body mass index.But locals say the scheme is another example of council jobsworths wasting taxpayers cash.Bin collections in the area are down to just once a month — while councillors signed off on £million rent commitment on its new headquarters.And despite reduced services, council taxes rose by  per cent this year.Local resident Mair Dempster-Jones, said of the bike plan: Tax payers paying for this nonsense again.

What I can tell you is there’s no orchestrated attempt to put letters in.He continued: But sensing the levels of frustration and annoyance colleagues are feeling it would not surprise meorganically letters are going in.The ERG has responded with fury to early reports of Mrs Mays Brexit deal.They claim it will leave the UK tied to the EU permanently thanks to the controversial Irish backstop meant to keep the border open.If Sir Graham, chair of the  Committee, receives  letters asking for a confidence vote, he must hold one within days.Mrs May will be kicked out of powershe fails to win the backing of  of the Tories  MPs.Butshe survives, the party cant hold another vote of confidence for at least a year.Another way Mrs May could be forced out is through a motion of no confidence in the entire government.A ’no confidence’ vote is a formal motion in the House of Commons with the wording: “That this house has no confidence in HM Government.”If there is a vote of no confidence, there will be a two-week ‘cooling off’ period in which time Mrs May will still remain in Downing Street.She will then try and talks to form a new government, butno government can be formed, the prime minister will be forced to call a date for a general election.Of course Mrs May could decide at any time she simply doesnt want to be Prime Minister any more.That will automatically trigger a leadership contest, where Tories will bid to become the next leader and PM.MPs will whittle down the challengers to just  - and those will then be handed over to the Tory membership who will vote and become the next PM.If all of them drop out - like in the summer of  where Mrs May became PM - whoever is left will become leader of the country automatically.They will then go to the Queen and ask permission to form a new government.Mrs May could also be forced out by way of a General election.If two thirds of MPs voted in the House of Commons for a fresh vote, then Parliament would be dissolved and the public would be asked to go to the ballot box yet again.In the event that Labour won more seats than the Tories, Mrs May would automatically be booted from No.If the Tories won the most seats then its likely she would try and form another government - whether on her own or in coalition with another party.Anything is possible in politics right now - even another referendum.If Mrs May decided to call a vote on her deal or No Deal at all, voters could be asked which they would prefer in another Brexit vote.In the event that the Government lost that, Mrs May would almost certainly have to leave office, as David Cameron did in .Today Mrs Mays job hangs by a thread after four ministers including Dominic Raab quit in protest at her deal.She told MPs in the Commons today that her deal was the best on offer, and she believed it was the best thing for the country.But furious MPs are still sending in letters of no confidence in her - and she could be toppled within hours."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449416246.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince charles 70th birthday party","story":"The Prince of Wales and we Camilla joined  readers also reaching that age this year to celebrate at our tea party for them.Four were born on the same day as the heir to the throne, November , .As he and the Duchess of Cornwall, , walked into Spencer House in London, our readers gathered on the steps of the mansion near The Mall and sang Happy Birthday.Later the Prince told them he was partly to blame for the unique celebrations.Charles revealed that on a foreign tour this year, he confided to our Arthur that it would be fun to enjoy reaching the milestone with people who were born on the same day.Prince Charles added: “So he went away without my knowing and this is the result.”Arthur, , who has spent more than  years photographing the Prince, launched a competition to find  readers who make a real dference in their communities.One of the four, Yuriko Davis, was born in Japan on November  — but due to the time dference, it was still the th here.The hospice volunteer, who now lives in Bristol, said: “I wished him happy birthday and he asked methere were many swear words in Japanese.

It’s fantastic. Comedy is not as funny as it used to be.” Jayne laughed and told him: “Too PC now Sir!”Malcolm Reid, who volunteers with cancer charity Maggie’s, of which the Duchess is president, said: “I always knew Charles and Camilla were nice people but it was very special to be able to find out first hand.”John Davies was nominated by we Ella for work he does volunteering as a handyman at the RAC Saddle Club Equestrian Centre in Bovington, Dorset. He said: “My mother had a picture of the Queen on her coronation day on the wall. I never thought I would be lucky enough to spend the day with her son on his birthday.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter. We were snowed in for a week. Nobody could come to visit.The missus couldn’t get to the shops to buy anything.It was just about perfect. All you need is a few bottles of Jack Daniel’s and some soup. Make sure you’re prepared.LUCKY, lucky earthquake victims.Here’s Paris Hilton in Mexico, visiting survivors of the  earthquake.And giving them bottles of Paris Hilton perfume and cushions with “Paris Hilton” stamped across them.Just exactly what they needed.Paris said: “I love the people, I think they are all beautul, they have great hearts, they are beautul inside and out, they are very genuine and incredible.”Just like you, Paris, just like you. A WOMAN who met the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester says she was offered an interesting proposition.Have sex with me, the -year-old goat suggested, and I’ll make you a baroness.Can’t say fairer than that, can you The most I’ve ever offered is a bag of Pickled Onion Monster Munch.Lester has been suspended from the House of Lords as a result.Thing is, it’s always the liberals who get up to this kind of stuff.Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and now Lester.Ladies, I’m telling you,a liberal bloke approaches you in a bar telling you how pro-feminist he is, activate your alarm, call the Old Bill and get the hell out, sharpish.THIS is Sophie Michelle. She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off. Threatening to kill anyone who supports her.We should give the poor woman asylum in our country, away from the Islamist savages in Pakistan.But the Government fears “reprisal” attacks by the extremists.That’s a gutless response and devoid of ­principle.Give Asia Bibi a home here. We’ll deal with the savagesthey try ­anything on.We’re getting used to it, after all.I’M trying to work out which of the Remoaners I dislike more. Gary Lineker or Tony Blair.I suppose Gary didn’t illegally invade a sovereign country.But then Blair never sported a stupid goatee beard or spent half of his le selling crisps.Although I daresay he would have donethere’d been enough dosh in it.Lineker, like many other remoaners, was demanding a second vote on Brexit.

And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet they hide the widespread exploitation of workers through illegally low pay, poor working conditions and in some cases, forced labour. This is unacceptable.”The committee said the Government should trial a licensing scheme for hand car washes and review whether the Modern Slavery Act could be updated to cover the sector.She said: “The Government must target the sector and prosecute exploitative employers. This would send a strong signal that worker exploitation has no place in the UK.”The MPs also raised fears of risks to water quality through waste water being allowed to flow into drains.Ms Creagh added: “Regulators seem to turn a blind eye to breaches of planning and environmental regulations at hand car washes.“Being labelled as ‘low risk’ must not mean hand car washes are given a permit to pollute.

but onlythe EU or an independent  sign it off.In a move that infuriated Brexiteers, the draft withdrawal agreement contained no fix date or “unilateral” way for the UK to collapse the controversial insurance measure that will keep Britain locked to Brussels trade rules for years.But in a win for Britain, the insurance option will be UK-wide rather than simply keeping Northern Ireland bound to Brussels.It reads: Until the future relationship becomes applicable, a single customs territory between the EU and the UK shall be established.Before the backstop kicks in, an option to extend the -month transition period can be discussed by both parties in July .But once it kicks in, either side have to give six months notice to bring it to an end - andboth sides do not agree a new trade deal keeps the Northern Irish border open, then a five-strong  of judges and experts will be called in.CITIZENS RIGHTSTHE Brexit agreement guarantees residence and social security rights to an estimated .million EU nationals living in the UK.And Brussels is thought to have made a similar pledge to the .million or so British expats living on the Continent.Theresa May had already declared that any EU citizen living in the UK could apply for Settled Status in Brexit Britain right up until the end of the transition phase on New Year’s Eve in .Those who arrive before  can have temporary leave to remain while they build up the five years they need to apply for Settled Status.Under the plans, the EU nationals will also have a “letime right” to bring their spouse, their parents and grandparents to the UK at any point.EU nationals can also bring in girlfriends or boyfriendsthey can prove they have been a “durable partner” for two years.Britain had already controversially conceded it would follow EU case law in the run up to Brexit on any legal cases regarding EU nationals.And it will take account of the views of the European Court of Justiceon citizens’ rights for up to eight years afterwards.DIVORCE BILLSOME £billion of taxpayers’ cash will be handed over to Brussels in a ‘Financial Settlement’ agreed by Theresa May and her negotiating team.Under the terms of the ‘Divorce Bill’, Britain will initially pay around £billion – reflecting the EU membership fees for the post-Brexit transition phase next year and .The remainder is made up of obligations and legal commitments from the UK’s -year membership - such as part-funding Eurocrat officials’ pensions.Under last night’s deal the EU will update the UK’s outstanding obligations by March  of each year – starting from .Any missed payments will accrue interest.Inthe UK will get cash back for its assets – such as its share of the European Investment Bank.EURO JUDGESEUROPEAN judges will have the ultimate say on most disputes relating to the Withdrawal Agreement - making it one of the most contentious parts of the document.A Joint Committee will be set up by the end of the transition period - comprising of two judges from each of the UK and EU and a fth independent.It will aim to resolve all disputes butno mutually agreed solution is agreed on any inidual dispute within three months then an arbitration  will be set up to make a final decision.But any dispute that involves a “concept” of EU law will go straight to the European Court of Justice to give a ruling on the question.This will trigger fears that all contentious decisions will ultimately be ruled upon by European judges - because most of the withdrawal agreement could be interpreted to involve “a concept of union law” and therefore be deferred to the ECJ.Within minutes of Mrs May revealing the deal had made it through the Cabinet, Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Brexiteer MPs to vote against it when it comes to the Commons.He wrote in an open letter: The proposed agreement will see the UK hand over £billion to the EU for little or nothing in .The deal is unacceptable to unionists, will lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws and is profoundly undemocratic.Mr Rees-Mogg added: For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in Parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.Mark Francois, a senior member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, warned Mrs May the deal could bring her time in office to an end.He blasted: A lot of colleagues are very unhappy with this deal. I would rule nothing out.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said she was dismayed and disgusted, adding: The only way to save Brexit is a new leader.Nadine Dorries said: The Cabinet backing this deal is the quickest route to a leadership election.And Nigel Farage tweeted: Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.But Eurocrats tonight spoke out in support of the deal and said it provided enough progress for the ongoing talks to move to the next stage - with a summit of European leaders taking place within a couple of weeks.Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was a decisive crucial step in concluding these negotiations.He claimed the deal would lead to an ambitious partnership, which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs co-operation, in depth and with a level playing field.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, wrote to European Council boss Donald Tusk officially recommending that the next stage should be triggered.He said: I look forward to our continued good co-operation with a view to bringing this important matter to a successful conclusion.During Prime Ministers Questions this afternoon, the PM was assailed from all sides over her Brexit plans.Jeremy Corbyn blasted: After two years of bungled negotiations, from what we know of the Governments deal its a failure in its own terms.Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone told Mrs May: You are not delivering the Brexit people voted for and today you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.And Ken Clarke called on her to put Parliament first by keeping MPs in the loop - instead of hatching agreements behind closed doors.Last night Cabinet ministers were called into Downing Street one by one to examine the details of the agreement.TOMORROW: Theresa May makes statement in the House of Commons in her first attempt to win the backing of MPs as a wholeNEXT FEW DAYS: EU diplomats study the text of the deal and flag up any problemsLATE NOVEMBER OR EARLY DECEMBER: EU leaders attend an emergency summit in Brussels, probably on November , where all  heads of government will sign off on the treatyBEFORE CHRISTMAS: Parliament votes on the withdrawal agreement -

in other words, the EU has a veto.It is coated in heavy fudge, but that is the inedible biscuit beneath the coating.He added that the proposals had united him and Boris Johnson in unholy alliance, adding: We agree this is a pointless Brexit in name only which is not the best of a bad job but the worst of both worlds.In the cause of taking back control we lose the control we had.Mr Blair highlighted the PowerPoint presentation used to promote Mrs May’s Chequers plan, claiming that the Prime Ministers Europe adviser Olly Robbins and the civil service had used “elaborate camouflage” to disguise elements of the proposals.He said: “I take my hat off to Olly Robbins, Olly is a very skilled guy, the elaborate camouflage of all the dferent points is a tribute to the skills of the British civil service, I say that sincerely.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449450595.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"michel barnier trap britain customs union","story":"Brussels’ chief negotiator said the terms of a UK-wide backstop to the Irish border will form the “basis” for the future trade deal.And he warned Theresa May she will have to agree to grant EU fishing vessels access to UK waters infor tarf-free access to the Single Market.The Frenchman made the remarks as he hailed the “crucial step” forward in the talks at a press conference in Brussels last night.He said: “Our objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we’re proposing in the Withdrawal Agreement, a single customs territory.“This agreement offers a basis for future negotiations and that is in our common interest.”In a boost for the embattled PM he added that sealing a wide-reaching trade deal is “possible” within the -month transition period.Mr Barnier insisted he was not “self-satisfied or smug” about reaching an agreement despite eurocrats roundly congratulating themselves on the breakthrough.But the comments will infuriate Eurosceptics already furious over a leaked diplomatic note that emerged yesterday from Sabine Weyand, Mr Barnier’s deputy.In it she told ambassadors that Britain had agreed to “level playing field” measures tying Britain to EU rules in areas such as state aid and environmental and workers’ rights protections during a so-called post-Brexit ‘backstop’ or customs fudge.She also said that Britain would “have to swallow a link between access to products and fisheries in future agreements”.EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker last night immediately wrote to his Council counterpart, Donald Tusk, saying “decisive progress” had been achieved.And Danish PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen said: “Green light!

It’s swapped vassalage for slavery.”Last night it appeared Theresa May had chucked elements of her controversial Chequers deal to get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line.Under the Chequers plan, the Government had argued for a single Common Rulebook for laws on a future trade deal.But last night a senior Government source refused to sayshe was still pushing for it, saying: “We may get frictionless trade through another way.”It could open the door for the UK to pursue a Canada-style free trade, championed by Boris Johnson.The major climbdown by No emerged when London and Brussels published a political declaration setting out an outline of a future trading relationship alongside the orce deal.Despite only being seven pages long, it spelt out a joint aspiration for the UK-EU’s future economic relationship.The draft agreement will now be the subject of intense negotiation over the next ten days before it is forecast to get the nod at an expected emergency EU summit on Sunday November .It sets ambitious goals for zero tarfs, no fees and no charges for all goods moving between the EU and the UK.On citizens and tourists, it proposes visa-free travel for short-term visits for Brits visiting Europe and Europeans coming to the UK.The draft agreement proposes a new fisheries deal.It also covers agreements in transport and energy, and says the future relationship would also cover justice, security and foreign policy co-operation.The whole document is based on the EU’s concept of the closer the cooperation and the more sovereignty is pooled, the better the access to Europe’s single market.Brexiteers have campaigned for years to free Britain from the stranglehold of the European Court of Justice.But the Withdrawal Document makes  references to the future role of the hated ECJ.Downing Street will have to give six months’ notice that it wants to walk away from the backstop.The request would go before a joint committee made up of two UK judges, two from the EU and one independent trade expert.If the two sides cannot agree on who the independent trade expert should be, they could “draw lots”.The Withdrawal Agreement confirms Britain will have to pay an estimated £billion “orce bill”. It reflects almost all of the detail of a deal outlined in principle a year ago when Theresa May made a pre-dawn dash to Brussels.The UK will as expected give letime residency to an estimated . million EU citizens currently living here.Their close family members will also be given the opportunity to have ‘Settled Status’ in Brexit Britain.Some . million British expats will be given the similar commitment on the Continent.Britain saw off a bid by Madrid and Brussels to use Brexit to open up fresh questions about Gibraltar’s sovereignty.Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “We urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for business, workers and consumers.”SOME £billion of taxpayers’ cash will be handed over to Brussels in a financial settlement agreed by Theresa May and her negotiating team.Britain will initially pay around £billion — reflecting EU membership fees for the post-Brexit transition phase next year and in .The rest is made up of obligations and legal commitments from the UK’s -year membership such as part-funding Eurocrat officials’ pensions.Under last night’s deal, the EU will update the UK’s outstanding obligations by March  of each year starting from .Any missed payments will accrue interest.

May last night abandoned her bitterly criticised Chequers plan for a future trade deal to agree a “free trade area” for goods instead.The major climbdown by No emerged when London and Brussels published a political declaration setting out an outline of a future trading relationship.At seven pages long, it spelt out a joint aspiration for the UK-EU’s future economic relationship.It suggests the deal is neither the Canada-style option favoured by the hardline Brexiteers nor the closer Norway model of single-market alignment.It will be “a free-trade area combining deep regulatory and customs co-operation”.It sets ambitious goals for zero tarfs, no fees and no charges for all goods moving between the EU and the UK.Alongside this are proposals for a “level playing field” on social, employment and environment standards in order to keep trade as frictionless and smooth as possible.It proposes a new fisheries deal governing access to each other’s waters and quota shares.THE controversial “backstop” insurance plan will only kick in after December the EU and UK decide not to extend the transition phase.In July , both sides can chose to extend the exit process one time only.The draft withdrawal agreement contained no fix date or “unilateral” way for the UK to collapse the controversial insurance measure that will keep the UK locked to Brussels trade rules for years.Once it kicks in, either side must give six months notice to end it by mutual agreement.If both sides do not agree a new trade deal that keeps the Northern Irish border open, then a five-strong  of judges and experts will be called in.We can appeal to an independent  to rule on whether Brussels is trying to trap the UK inside a never-ending customs union.However the UK will sign up to “level playing field rules” to stop us getting an economic advantage over the EU by cutting rules or taxes.BRITAIN saw off an attempt by Madrid and Brussels to use Brexit to open up further questions about the sovereignty of Gibraltar.The Rock is covered by exactly the same orce terms as the UK mainland.But a decision on whether to let the Spanish share the access to Gibraltar airport has been kicked into the long grass.Also Brexit questions over keeping our RAF bases in Cyprus have also been put to bed.Brussels raised the possibility of hiving off Gibraltar and possibly excluding it from any transition phase because of its border with Spain.But the withdrawal agreement makes clear this is not the case and any mention of the UK also covers the territory.There will however be joint committees set up between the UK, Spain and Gibraltarian governments to tackle smuggling of petrol and alcohol over the border after Brexit.And there will also be joint measures to tackle money-laundering and tax avoidance. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Enforcing those laws will mean an EU presence: EU representatives will be present to enforce and implement the law relating to Northern Ireland, and the UK will have to facilitate their work and carry out necessary control measures.The document states that the EU and the UK will use their \"best endeavours\" to come to a future trade agreement to avoid the backstop, and notes the transition period can also be extended.Otherwise, it could be tricky to get out of the backstop.One party would need to apply to the other to end it, and an exit would have to be decided by the joint commission by the top decision makers from the EU and UK.

It may be turgid but the draft Brexit deal is vitally important - and itll decideTheresa May is toppled. The agreement could have a huge impact on Northern Ireland businesses and keep the UK locked in the orbit of Brusselsthings go wrong. MPs are likely to demand it is voted down when it comes to a crunch decision in Parliament. That would throw Brexit back to square one and is likely to remove the flailing Prime Minister from office. So what is in the Brexit deal and why are people so het up about it  Weve taken a closer look.  Weve signed up to a transition period that will continue pretty much all EU rules until December . Now this could be extended - and crucially, we dont yet know how long for. The deal only covers to the year xx. Which to put it mildly is a bit vague. Senior officials insist that by the time MPs have a vote, therell be a maximumof extra transition - which would then be whittled down further. But its likely to prompt a huge row. The transition period can only be extended once. And it would be done by the UK making a request before  June . This request would be considered by an arbitration . That  would have  UK members,  EU members and  independent member, chosen through a legal process. We dont know who theyd be. Eventhe transition period is extended we could still end up in a backstop. For more on that, read on...  Under the backstop - a backup plantheres no agreement for the Northern Ireland border - there COULD be checks on some goods between Northern Ireland and the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies say this is unacceptable and its likely to prompt a huge row. Northern Ireland firms will access the EU Single Market as a whole without restriction. This will mean Northern Ireland will have to apply EU law on industrial, environmental and agricultural goods. That means some of these goods would need checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  The backstop -it kicks in on  January  - will extend EU customs rules across the whole of the UK. This makes Brexiteers furious because it will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world - and lock us into Brussels rules without any say on them. Whats worse, we can only quit the backstopthere is mutual agreement between the UK and the EU. Senior UK officials insisted the EU would have to act in good faith. But thatll be cold comfort to Tory Brexiteers. European courts will still have a big hold on the UK  Any judgements from the European Court of Justice handed down during the transition period will be binding on the UK. And the arbitration  that resolves disputeswill not intervene in cases involving EU law. Instead the European Court of Justice will rule on those questions. And we still have a long way to go...  Senior UK officials tonight admitted there is still a lot of negotiation to go. The UK has now unlocked negotiations on the so-called future framework for a deal that can lead to trade after Brexit. They are trying to get parts of that closed off before MPs have their meaningful vote in Parliament. So sit tight - theres a very long way still left to run.

In her parting missive, she attacked the Prime Minister for breaking promises to the public by failing to deliver to the party promises she made at the outset of negotiations. Here is the full text of her resignation letter There is no more important task for this Government than delivering on the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union.This is a matter of trust.It is about the future of our country and the integrity of our democracy. The deal you put before the Cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum. Indeed, it doesnt meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership. Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy.I have always supported you to deliver on those objectives. Even after Chequers when you knew I shared the concerns of a very signicant number of colleagues, I believed that we could still work collectively to honour the will of the British people and secure the right outcome for the future of our country.This deal fails to do this. Brexit deal live: Theresa May in turmoil as Dominic Raab and Esther McVey resign The proposals put before Cabinet, which will soon be judged by the entire country, means handing over around poundbn to the EU without anything in .It will trap us in a customs union, despite you specically promising the British people we would not be. It will bind the hands of not only this, but future Governments in pursuing genuine free trade policies. We wouldnt be taking back control, we would be handing over control to the EU and even to a third country for arbitration. It also threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom, which as a Unionist is a risk I cannot be party to. The British people have always been ahead of politicians on this issue, and it will be no good trying to pretend to them that this deal honours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone it doesnt. We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal, to any deal is better than no deal. I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal. I could not look my constituents in the eye were I to do that. I therefore have no alternative but to resign from the Government. It has been a huge honour to serve as Secretary of State for Work  Pensions, and I am immensely proud of the part I have played in the record levels of employment we have seen in all parts of the U.K. Youth unemployment has halved since , and we now have record number of women and BAME in work and since , , more disabled people in work. With employment over .million more than in  we have helped , more people into work each and every day since we took office. I am extremely grateful to you for appointing me to the role, and for the support you have given to me, not least in the run up to the budget, ensuring Universal Credit got a much needed injection of pound.billion. That has made my decision a greater wrench. However, in politics you have to be true to the public and also true to yourself.

Hard Remain, Hard Brexit , loyalism and nervous backers. It can all be quite dficult to understand. So weve put together a guide to how things went down then - and how theyre going down now.  When the numbers are crunched, it is clear that Mrs May will have her work cut out to convince enough MPs to support her EU exit strategy. Now that a draft deal has been agreed between the EU and UK, there are three hurdles to overcome. The first is Cabinet, the second is  EU leaders, and the third and hardest is the UK Parliament. Its the third bit were worried about here. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions on it all are explained in more detail here. Even though they disagree on the reasons why, they could band together and vote down the deal - defeating Theresa May.  Here are the factions and where they sit.  MPs would be enough to defeat the PM. TORY LOYALISTS: More than  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. TORY BREXITEERS: One source rubbished claims  Tory MPs could oppose the deal. But they conceded “ to  of the swivel-eyed lot” could line up against the plan. This group fears a Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels, and includes Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. TORY REMAINERS: Insiders believe up to  Tory Remainers could vote against the PM’s deal. They include former ministers Justine Greening, Jo Johnson and Phillip Lee. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down any deal that allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. As things look now theyll vote against the deal because it wont meet Labours six tests for a good exit. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Tory Brexit. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Westminster sources have drawn up an “inner list” of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs they believe will back the PM. But it has just two names on it. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. Eight Independent MPs sit in the Commons, though seven were elected for parties before either quitting their respective whips or having it withdrawn. Of those, three, possibly four, would back the PM, with another likely to vote against the deal because it does not deliver a hard enough Brexit.

The Labour leader also said the Government is in chaos after describing the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration as a huge and damaging failure. Replying to the Prime Ministers Brexit update, Mr Corbyn told the Commons: After two years of bungled negotiations the Government has produced a botched deal that breaches the Prime Ministers own red lines and does not meet our six tests. The Government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say. When even the last Brexit Secretary, who theoretically at least negotiated the deal, says I cannot support the proposed deal, what faith does that give anyone  in this place or in this country  The Government simply cannot put to Parliament this half-baked deal that both the Brexit Secretary and his predecessor have rejected. No-deal is not a real option and the Government has not seriously prepared for it.  Mr Corbyn went on: The withdrawal agreement is a leap in the dark - an ill-defined deal by a never-defined date. The Labour leader told MPs that the backstop insurance policy, as Mrs May put it, would create a de facto border down the Irish Sea. He said: In fact the list of EU measures that continue to apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland runs to  pages of the agreement, this affects VAT declarations and rules of origin checks. Mr Corbyn also said it was clear the Prime Ministers red line regarding jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice had also been torn up. He said: By  under the Prime Ministers plan, we will either be in a backstop or still in transition. It is utterly far-fetched for the Prime Minister to say this plan means we take control over our laws, money and borders.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it has prompted a flurry of Cabinet resignations including Dominic Raab and Esther McVey - and still has to get through a vote in Parliament. As time runs out, plans are now being put into action while the nations politicians try to escape their deadlock over a Brexit deal. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and have to stockpile food and medicine at the stroke of pm. The government has issued  technical notices on the practical effects of No Deal - everything from driving licences to cats. FOLLOW IT LIVE HERE  A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business. Instead we have looked through the facts to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader - and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen.  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increase the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . For more on how those negotiations are going click here.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left stranded with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.”  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, deal is reached at a technical level between the UK and EU.  November : Cabinet meeting reluctantly agrees the deal after  hours but  ministers speak against it.  November : Theresa May gives statement to Parliament.  November : Emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. Tory ministers could hand corporate giants a massive tax cut in a No Deal Brexit , a top Cabinet figure revealed in October. Dominic Raab said the government will “pull every lever weve got” to ease business “disruption”the UK leaves the EU with no agreement in March . The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from % to % - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  A major motorway is being closed overnight for more than a month in the run-up to Christmas so it can be turned into a lorry park in case of a no-deal Brexit . Highways England began preparations in October for the M in Kent to be used as a holding area for lorriesthere is gridlock at ports like Dover. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border.

Since , a small industrial zone near Leeds city centre has become an area where police say there is a “lower likelihood of arrest” for those involved in the sex trade. Leeds councillors yesterday voted to have an independent review into the managed approach, in Holbeck, after calls were made for it to be suspended. The women working in the zone have a dedicated female plain-clothes officer they can turn to for help. And police, who make regular patrols, mostly turn a blind eye to the sex trade.  CCTV cameras were put up by the council shortly after the  murder of Polish national Daria Pionko, . But the managed scheme has been slammed by locals. Campaign group Save Our Eyes claims children are in danger, and are witnessing sexual activity and drug taking on a daily basis. But the sex workers in the city defended the arrangement, saying “it’s keeping us alive” and “feeding our kids”. Cllr Amanda Carter yesterday told the chamber: “The pimps have to be dealt with because [the women] are controlled by these men who are evil.” But Cllr Andrew Scopes told the council: “In , only % of crime was reported – now that rate is %.” The Mirror has spoken to those on both sides of the debate.  You cant stop this trade but its safe for us here Desperate women who say they are forced to sell their bodies after getting caught in a poverty trap are urging the council not to axe the zone. One, a -year-old mum, said: “I’ve got no criminal record and I don’t take drugs. I’ve never stolen anything in my le. But three months ago I lost my professional job of  years and I’ve got nothing to live on. “I’ve got a claim in for benefits but haven’t had a penny. They tell me to be patient, but being patient isn’t going to feed my child or pay my mortgage. “A few months ago I’d only ever slept with seven men, now I’m seeing perverts every night. “I hate it but I’ve got to pay my bills and save my home. This is my secret, my partner thinks I work in a bar. It’s a horrible secret to keep.” But she urged the council and police not to shut the zone down, adding: “This is an industrial area, there’s CCTV and police patrolling all the time. It’s safe for us here. You’re never going to stop this trade, toleration is the key.” A mum-of-two, aged , also claimed a cut in benefit forced her on to the streets. She said: “They took pound a week off me. My kids are nine and one and I need to get school unorm for the eldest. “I didn’t have a good childhood. My kids aren’t going to suffer like I did. What the kids want, they get. “But it has to be paid for. That’s why I’m here. My boyfriend doesn’t know. He thinks I work in a strip bar. He doesn’t agree with it. My first [punter] was really sweet and now I can earn pound a night. I’m good at it. I’ve been out in snow shivering but I made pound, that night because they felt sorry for me.”  Many street workers congregate on Holbeck Lane under the scrutiny of half a dozen CCTV cameras. The area is littered with pink condoms, given to the girls by a local charity. A makesht bed – an old massage table – lies in waste ground nearby surrounded by condoms and human excrement. “They complain about the condoms but don’t provide bins,” said a -year-old, clutching her silver heels to give her aching feet a break. “I bring nappy sacks with me.” She said she had been a sex worker for  years and had entertained some , men at a rate of up to  a night. She said: “We need these cameras to protect us. I’ve got called a slag – I’m not a slag, I get paid for it. “I had six eggs thrown at me the other day and one hit me on the head.”  She admits working the streets to feed her crack cocaine habit. A Romanian aged  told how she boosts her pound-a-month factory wage by coming to the zone twice a week. She has been in the UK for five years and said: “I feel safe because of the CCTV cameras and police. There are some men I’m scared of.” Another woman, who is with her, discreetly nods at a middle-aged man in a Volkswagen car who has been parked up watching the girls all night. She said: “He owns half the girls on this street. He supplies them with cocaine and they pay him. He’s got six women under his control. But not me.” Chloe, : I get old men offering me sweets for sex on my way to school  A schoolgirl who lives nears the red light zone claims she has been approached about  times by “old men” with one offering her sweets for sex. Chloe Lynch, , said she has been pestered since she was  while walking to and from school in her unorm. She said: “Once I was in a group walking back and a man offered us sweets. “Another time an old man askedI was working and asked me to go in his house. “It is frightening. Before, I thought prostitute meant some sort of politician. I didn’t even know what one was. But now I know what it means. It’s scary.” Chloe’s mum Gemma, , said locals fear for the safety of their children, who are exposed to sexual activity almost daily. She told how her youngest child, nine-year-old Charis, saw a prostitute injecting a man in his genitals. “We don’t let the kids play out now,” Gemma said. “This managed area was all right at first but now it has spread to residential streets.” Even the local primary school caretaker has been forced to clear up condoms and used syringes every morning, campaigners claim. And recently a grandmother alleged a man approached her as she pushed a pram and sickeningly asked her for an hour alone with the baby. Police said they were investigating this claim. Local shop owner Laura Walton, , said “The managed area has spread – some can’t be bothered to walk down to the zone.  “There’s used condoms and needles all over Holbeck now. The prostitution seems to have moved to the residential areas. “People are seeing them having sex outside their homes, in people’s driveways, phone boxes and around St Matthew’s Church. In the summer it gets worse and we have to prepare ourselves. I had customers in one day with children and a woman lted her skirt up at us. “My friend’s little boy is four and he asked his mum about one woman: ‘She’s not coming back is she, that bad lady ’” Chief Superintendent Steve Cotter said: “We encourage people to report incidents immediately. We recently increased the level of resources we have dedicated to the Managed Approach and we have had some positive feedback about policing of the area. “We will not allow crime or antisocial behaviour to go unchallenged.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains nuclear bomb test legacy","story":"NewsDaughter born with S-shaped bones and teeth growing sideways and son born with hole in the eye - Britains nuclear bomb test legacyThe horric story behind the UKs nuclear experiments have been told in full for the first timeShareCommentsBySusie Bonace:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mirror-been-fighting-justice-medal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter the horrors of the Second World War, it was deemed necessary for Britain to have a weapon that could unleash hell. When atom bombs were dropped on Japan in , LIFE magazine reported: “People’s bodies were terribly squeezed, then their internal organs ruptured. Then the blast blew the broken bodies at  to , miles-an-hour through the flaming, rubble-filled air.” Yet, the powers-that-be in Britain decided a nuclear capability was the only was to guarantee our safety. A small nation, wracked by poverty and rationing, somehow defied American anger, Soviet spies and growing public outrage to create a device  times more powerful than those dropped on Japan. But it came at a price. Of the , scientists and servicemen who took part in radioactive experiments in Australia and the South Pacic, just a handful are alive. Their families report cancers, rare medical problems, high rates of miscarriage – and deformities, disability and death for their children – and their grandchildren. Now, the full story of Britain’s nuclear experiments has been told for the first time in a new Mirror website that details not only the scientic, military and political battles, but the human fallout. DAMNED features top-secret documents, eyewitness accounts and searing testimonies.  The site takes its name from an editorial written in  by Mirror editor Richard Stott, who thundered: “How many more generations of the damned will our politicians allow to suffer before they accept the calamities of their predecessors and the consequences of their own cowardice ” In May, the Mirror called for an award for the veterans and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has ordered a medal review. DAMNED begins with Operation Hurricane in , when Britain exploded its first atomic bomb, covers the Minor Trials in South Australia, which left the landscape littered with plutonium debris for decades, and reports on Operation Grapple in  when the UK detonated its biggest weapon. It also details the human cost and shows how every other nuclear nation on Earth came to accept and recognise their nuclear heroes – leaving Britain the only one to deny a duty of care. The MoD said: “We are grateful to all those who participated in the British nuclear testing programme which contribute to keeping our country secure and we carefully consider every request to recognise their extraordinary accomplishments. The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three large studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in these tests to ill health.” DAMNED has a memorial section with the pictures and health problems of every veteran from our archives. Some of their stories can be read here: I was used in a human radiation experiment Bob Malcolmson was an -year-old wireless operator on destroyer HMS Diana in  when he was used in a human radiation experiment. Operation Mosaic saw the ship spend eight hours after each of two blasts in the toxic clouds. Captain John Gower later wrote: “We were required… to deliberately contaminate our ship.” The aim was to seethe vessel could be washed down andthe crew remained operational. Bob left the navy in , but four years later, was diagnosed with polycythemia rubra vera, a condition linked to radiation which makes his bone marrow produce too many red blood cells. In  the MoD admitted it was due to his service and made a payout of pound,.  He has had  procedures to remove blood, a heart bypass, glaucoma and cataracts, a deep vein thrombosis, an incurable circulatory condition, four operations to remove skin cancer, eight operations on his leg, two stents and had part of his penis cut out to remove a cancerous tumour.

The -year-old shot dead Fred Barras, , and wounded accomplice Brendon Fearon, , when they burgled his Norfolk farm in . The case ided the nation – with many saying he had the right to defend his home and property. He was convicted of murder and wounding with intent and got a le term in  but the murder rap was downgraded to manslaughter on appeal and he was freed in . Still unrepentant, Mr Martin said he last year visited Barras’s grave for the first time and thought: “Well, boy, this is basically what you wanted.” He also claimed burglars have targeted his now derelict farmhouse, Bleak House, again. And he told of how he believes his standing shyconvictions should now be quashed. Mr Martin will appeal the shyconvictions amid claims new evidence has been found, which casts doubt on original findings in the case.  Asked why he was making the move, he said: “Your home is your castle, it’s about having the courage to be free. I want freedom for people who are decent. I have a right to clear my name – I’m not sure how much longer I’ve got to live.” The appeal is expected to set out analysis of the original probe and concerns over forensic evidence, the trial and appeal. The case will be submitted to the shyCriminal Cases Review Commission, which decides whether to take it on – with new evidence almost always needed. The CCRC mulls whether the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal, based on whether there is a “real possibility” a conviction would be quashed. The move comes as a dramatisation of Mr Martin’s story screens on Channel  this weekend. He is played by The League of Gentlemen’s Steve Pemberton in The Interrogation, which is based on police interviews. He said of the drama: “It will be interesting to see how it comes over. I’m a simple man really. I see things more clearly than the establishment.”  Mr Martin was in Lincolnshire for a farming show last year when he sought out the grave of Barras, from Newark. He said: “I stayed there for a couple of minshyshyutes. It’s got a photo of Barras on it, the same one used in the papers. “That was the only photo I’d ever seen of him – I couldn’t see him at the time [of the shooting]. “I ran into a guy in the graveyard and asked himhe knew where Barras’s grave was. He said he did. I told him, ‘It’s a strange thing to say but I’m the one who put him there’. “I looked at the grave and said, ‘Well, boy, this is basically what you wanted. You’ve made your mark’. I suppose I made my mark too but my mark came about simply because I happened to live in a house. Barras did what he wanted to do. He had a short le. Seeing the photo and reading about him, he seemed a happy sort of lad.” In August , Mr Martin was charged with murder, attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause injury and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger le. He did not hold a valid shotgun certicate – or the more restrictive firearms certicate needed for the Winchester pump-action shotgun he used. In his trial, the prosecution accused him of lying in wait and opening fire without warning, after previous break-ins. A shot was fired towards the raiders in his shystairwell and two as they fled.  Both suffered leg wounds and Barras was hit in the back, dying at the scene. Fearon and getshyshyaway driver Darren Bark, , admitted conspiring to burshyshygle the house. Fearon got three years’ jail and Bark received  months. In , Mr Martin’s le term was cut to five years on grounds of diminished responsibility, after he was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by depression. Mr Martin still works the  acres of land at his farm but has not set foot in Bleak House since Barras’s death. He said: “I’ve no end of jobs. I’ve never caught up with the four years I lost.” Of the recent break-in, he said: “I put a ladder out the other day, up a tree. Later, they’d put it against the house.

According to Claire, when she called the school they had no idea that he had disappeared. Outraged Claire then called the nursery to let them know Connor was at home - only for staff to admit they had no idea the little boy had disappeared. Unbelievably, the youngster had broken out of Holy Trinity Nursery School in Taunton, Somerset, and walked  minutes to walk back to his home. As well as climbing out a window, he had opened two gates completely unassisted. The furious mum said: I felt sick to my stomach when Connor showed up at the door. I couldnt believe what was happening. Hes four-years-old. He could have been run over on the main road.  My heart was racing when he came to the door. He burst into tears as he thought I would be angry at him, but I wasnt. I was angry at the nursery. It was awful. Claire has now taken Connor out of the nursery following the incident as she does not trust staff to look after him. She said she has looked at putting Connor into another nursery, but the ordeal has left her worried the same thing could happen again. Claire added: Im just really frightened that something more serious could have happened as a result of the incident. The windows and the side gate should have been locked long before my son managed to leave unnoticed. I feel as a parent other parents deserve to know whats happened.

Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events. However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true. She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

Obviously flying can be very weather dependent, but in the summer months this can be more than twice a week.  I think generally people find it very interesting and a bit whacky. We regularly get people dropping into our factory to ask questions about how to learn and often they mention that they were inspired to come and check things out after seeing us flying overhead. The quirky commuting method may cut out traffic, but it takes roughly the same amount of time as driving for most of the employees.  It is however better for the environment as the parajet can also work like a glider, it uses signicantly less fuel than a car or motorcycle. Tom added: Because our type of flying comprises a combination of both the engine and the glider we can stay airborne for sustained periods without using a huge amount of fuel when compared to cars and other larger vehicles. As a result whist its not fully green, its definitely a step in the right direction.

Alana Burns, who is due to give birth in March, has crammed her kids Alisha, two, Steven, four, Cayden, seven, Leigh, , and Caitlin, , as well as adult children Stewart, , and Bryan, , in the flat above a pub. The family has squeezed into three of the four bedrooms as the fourth is uninhabitable due to a leak. Ms Burns said: My relationship with some of my children is at breaking point. We cant keep living like this. I just want to get out of this hell. Id rather live anywhere , as long as it is not in here. It has been really tough. The council has been out to the leak and said theyd get in touch with me, I have heard nothing. The family was living in a private let in nearby Livingston until her landlord decided to sell the property in August. They spent a month in hotels before West Lothian Council found the Bathgate flat in September.  But Ms Burns added: Im feeling down every night and sometimes you just feel like giving up. But I just have to keep going for the sake of the kids. It is not safe for anyone to be sleeping in that room so were now down to eight people sharing three bedrooms which is ridiculous. Ms Burns says the flat, which does not have a television or room outside in which her children can play, also has uneven flooring, damaged ceilings, noisy neighbours and is not receiving post. She is having to pay out pound a day on electricity and claims a third party is using her supply. The mother continued: We all have to wake up at .am and a taxi picks the kids up at .am to take them to school in Livingston. I need a proper house where I can bring up my children. The whole situation is unbelievable. My kids cant go out to play here. The road in front is busy and there is a car park at the back of the property so it isnt safe. All the kids are stuck inside all night crammed in without any TV. There is no way were using anywhere near that level of electricity. We wouldnt be herewe had a choice but we need to now get out as soon as possible.  A West Lothian Council spokesman said: It can be challenging to find suitable accommodation for large families who present themselves as homeless, given the limited stock of larger homes available. In this case, the council arranged for temporary accommodation from a private landlord to try and meet their housing needs until a permanent home could be found. Previous repairs notied by Ms Burns have been fixed by the landlord. The leak was only notied to us on November , with a repair to be arranged soon.  We would encourage Ms Burns to engage with the offers of support already made, to allow us to help find a solution for her familys housing needs. This includes widening her choice of areas to maximise her opportunities for permanent housing.

Despite saying she would pick it up, she said they even tailed her into a local pub after demanding her name and address. The woman - who has not been named - told Grimsby Live she was left feeling harassed and intimated. She said litter wardens confronted her and told her she could be arrestedshe refused to give her name and address - and told her she faced a pound fine. It comes after North East Lincolnshire Council commissioned a private company to tackle the boroughs litter and dog fouling problem. The agreement is on a trial period of  months to allow time for a fair and accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the enforcement activity. Although the crackdown has been widely welcomed, concerns had been raised by former councillor John Stockton, who felt that the use of a private company could lead to people being chased down the street in order to find names and addresses.  The woman said she refused to give details because she was scared of the prospect of having to pay pound which she could not afford. The woman also says that she was completely unaware that the private enforcement had started, as there had been no information provided about a start date and no signs to warn of the steep fine. She said: I was just finishing using the cash machine at Barclays, and I was walking away when I dropped my cigarette on the ground. Instantly I was confronted by someone who told me that I would have to pay a pound on-the-spot fine, and even though I told the woman that I was going to pick the cigarette up, she told me that it didnt matter and I was going to get the fine anyway. If she looked around she would have seen lots of other people doing the same thing. I told the officer that I simply couldnt afford to pay pound in the run up to Christmas and said that I wouldnt be giving him my details. Then I was then surrounded by four others who were threatening to have the police come and arrest me. I would have thought the police had better things to do than arrest someone over a dropped cigarette.  The woman said she tried to walk off when one officer tried to grab her but missed. She added: I was followed the whole way through town by five of them, four men and a woman. I felt harassed and intimated. She walked into a pub to try to evade the wardens but claims they followed her in. She said: I went into a nearby pub to try and get away from them, but they followed me inside there as well, during which time I am sure there were many more people dropping cigarettes and probably worse. Then when I left the pub they followed me up passed the Train Station to Bargate, where I finally was free from them. I am now scared to go into town, because they have told me that police are now looking for me. All this over a cigarette which I said that I would put in the bin. North East Lincolnshire Council have strongly denied that any officers have been harrassing people who drop litter. It says the staff adhere to strict behavioural standards and use body cameras to record their actions. A spokesperson said: We completely refute any claims that the enforcement officers are harassing people. The officers adhere to strict behavioural standards and use body cameras to record their actions when they issue a ticket. When they collect evidence for the fixed penalty noticethey need the person’s name and address. If people want to appeal or make a complaint, there are details on the ticket. Councillor David Bolton, portfolio holder for safer and stronger communities, said: There is absolutely no excuse to drop litter anywhere in North East Lincolnshire. This is the exact type of environmental crime that people hate to see in our borough. People who drop litter make the place look unsightly and it’s left for us to clean up after them. The council spends around thousands every year just picking up rubbish other people have dropped.

He might not be very popular anymore, but big Mr Blobby fans might remember that he once had his own theme park. Crinkley Bottom, or Blobbyland opened in Cricket St Thomas, Somerset in  in the height of Blobbymania, when the pink spotty sidekick starred in Noel Edmonds House Party.

A map of the Crinkley Bottom theme park shows a railway, an Animals of Farthing Wood attraction alongside sea lion shows, a safari ride, fun village, a deer park and leopards. There was also a TVs family favourites attraction and a high street featuring the Blobby Shop.  But the main pull of the park for s kids was, of course, Mr Blobbys house. Dunblobbin, painted bright pink with yellow spots and a blue roof, was surrounded by a white picket fence and had windowsills adorned with blooming plastic flowers. Next to its iconic front door, where everyone wanted their photo taken, was a doorbell which could be pressed to hear the familiar shrill cry of Blobby blobby blobby! According to the unofficial Dunblobbin website, this jaunty doorbell could be heard outside the park by locals who cursed the house.  The lounge had sofas covered in floral patterned fabric and a TV set which looked like something straight out of the Flintstones. A large stuffed blobby dog slept on the floor - again, pink with yellow spots - and a blobby fish floated in a bowl. The walls bore portraits of Mr Blobby, his we and baby. In the kitchen, visitors could see the Blobby family lived on a diet of predominantly cake. And when they got to the bathroom they were in for a surprise - Mr Blobbys giant head poking out from behind a shower screen. Even the toilet was pink and spotty.  The bedroom was filled with the sound of snoring, with Mrs Blobby snoozing in bed and baby Blobby in his little pink cot. When the theme park closed in the late s, the buildings were left standing until they were discovered by urban explorers in .

For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that and try as they might not to, the fans must be getting excited."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bec01fb2effb.jpg ","title":"tonight dundees glen kamara buzzing to build on first international goal","story":"After opening his international goal account last time out, Glen Kamara is “buzzing” to have the chance to help Finland qualy for the Nations League play-offs.The -year-old fired in his first-ever senior goal as his country saw off Greece - last month in Tampere to keep up their % record in League C Group Two.The Finns head to Athens tonight needing just a point to confirm their promotion to League B after a superb run that’s seen them yet to concede a goal in their four matches that’s also seen a home-and-away double over Estonia.The team’s successes over the past few months are in complete contrast to his club season at Dundee this campaign.With the Dark Blues languishing at the foot of the Premiership table and goals few and far between, manager Jim McIntyre has urged his midfield to provide more goal threat.And Kamara, who has been pushed further forward by his new boss lately, says he has ambitions to add some club goals to his single international effort.“I’d say I’ve had about one shot in my time at Dundee!” the former Arsenal man said.“I definitely need to shoot more and try to help out the team with goals, it is something I’m working on.”And despite firing in a goal for his country that sealed victory over the Greeks, Kamara wasn’t overly proud by the quality of his first touch.He said: “What was the goal like  Don’t watch it!“I made a really bad touch into a good touch and a finish.“It was great, something I didn’t expect but I was buzzing after it.“It’s a great feeling to score for your country and we got a - win over Greece as well.“They are coming up again so we’ll have to be ready again.”Ranked th in the world and below upcoming opponents Greece and Hungary in the world rankings, the Finns’ record of four wins from their first four Nations League games have surprised onlookers.However, Kamara insists nobody within the camp is surprised at how well they’ve fared.Under manager Markku Kanerva, the Eagle Owls as they are nicknamed, have spread their wings and begun to fly after years in the international wilderness following the retirement of former Ajax great and Liverpool forward Jari Litmanen.That’s despite a lack of household names with Norwich striker Teemu Pukki most likely to be known to football fans on these shores after an unsuccessful spell at Celtic.Momentum is building, however, and the Finns will be hopeful of finding a backdoor route to Euro  through winning their Nations League group.That needs at least one point from tonight’s trip to Athens or the game against Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.Kamara said: “The team is in a good place, the manager is doing well and they are a good group of boys.“Things are going well in the Nations League and we have a good chance of winning our group.“We have Greece and Hungary up this week and with a win I’d say we’ll top the group.“That’s maybe surprised a few people but the team knew we were good enough after playing a few games together and,you watch us, you can see we are at a good level right now.”Kamara’s Dundee team-mate Benjamin Kallman has also featured for the full national side this year, though is more often involved with the U  squad.He remains at Dens Park this week as the young Finns don’t have any fixtures scheduled."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Strictly-Come-Prancing-dancers.jpg ","title":"were doing 20 hours of dancing this week stage all set for strictly come prancing in dundee this weekend","story":"The disco ball is being dusted off as Dundee prepares for its most glamorous charity event of the year. vw, px\"  Strictly Come Prancing takes place this Saturday at pm, with  couples taking to the stage in support of children’s charity Help for Kids.The event, featuring fashion icon Gok Wan as head judge, is being supported by the Evening , Wave FM and the Overgate Shopping Centre.The night is being hosted by the Apex Hotel, and the nerves and excitement are beginning to build as the big day approaches.With precious little rehearsal time left, the Tele caught up with some of the couples before they take their bow.Iain McLeod, , and fiancée Jemma Ward, , from St Mary’s, are one duo in the spotlight.Jemma said: “All the other couples have been really supportive and I think we are all going to go for it on the night.”Another couple – Carolyn McLaren, , from Stobswell, and Mark Rice, , from Fintry – are also taking the plunge on Saturday.

We have progressed a lot since the start and we’re definitely going to put on a show. We’re both quite natural performers, but whether we could be the winners, I don’t know.”Grant James Mulholland, , from Broughty Ferry, and Shirene Smith, , from Charleston, have been brought together by the event.The pair were strangers before the competition kicked off and joined the rest of the couples on Monday evening for a dance rehearsal.Shirene said: “I’m feeling a lot better since the rehearsal this week,  times better.“It made me feel much more relaxed. I hope no one falls over.”Family friends, Mark Dunlop, , and Kelly Leslie, , missed the first six weeks of training due to holidays in Australia and Florida.Now getting firmly into their stride, Kelly said: “We’re both really excited and the routine is really coming along great.“I will be quite nervous but Mark is quite confident.”The winning couple will be crowned on Saturday evening after the  couples perform in front of an audience of  people.All the funds raised on the night go to Help for Kids.it is almost here and for once I can genuinely say I am really excited for Saturday.On Monday all of the couples got together alongside Urban Moves to share our hard work and perform our routines in front of an audience for the first time.It was great to catch up with couples that I hadn’t seen for  weeks since our induction and hear how they had got on.When we got up to perform my belly was turning so I can only imagine what it will be like under the bright lights on Saturday, however they quickly disappeared and I actually enjoyed myself.Each and every one of the dances are unbelievable soyou have a ticket for Saturday night you are in for a treat.The Tele’s own Amy Hall is

I think it’s important to show other people with a disability it doesn’t matter.“You can learn to swim and don’t need to go into private lessons. They can go into the normal Learn to Swim programme.“Swimming’s been a huge part of my le. It’s given me more confidence and so many experiences to travel and meet new people.“If you want to take it up I think it’s a really good thing to do.”Toni’s journey in aquatics began on the Learn to Swim programme at Northfield Swimming Pool, before she joined Cults Otters club.Her talent saw her move to join up with the Aberdeen University high-performance squad.The  Tokyo Paralympics hopeful has experience as an instructor – teaching her own mum how to swim.Her role will involve promoting swimming among youngsters at launches across the country, with world, Olympic and European champion Duncan Scott another of the governing body’s ambassadors. vw, px\"  Paul Wilson, disability performance development manager for Scottish Swimming, said: “Toni has had some success on the international stage, so in terms of inspiration to younger athletes she’s the perfect role model for us.“The key thing is, with her age.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"health bosses struggling hire gps","story":"recruitment \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDoctors surgeries face a shortage of  GPs in Ayrshire.

are.\"Inspections are vital for parents to make an informed choice about their childrsquos education.\"Many young families look at these reports before a potential move and with so many out of date in the Borders, it can only be putting people off.\"But our hard-working teachers are also being let down because inspections provide important feedback and advice.\"Among the  local schools which havent been fully inspected in the past decade are Hawick High School , Priorsford Primary , Stow Primary , Walkerburn Primary , Broomlands Primary , Fountainhall Primary , Jedburgh Grammar Schooland Eyemouth High .Its also been nine years since Berwickshire High was inspected, eight years since Earlston High, seven years since either Peebles High or Kelso High were visited and five years since Galashiels Academy was graded.One of the s of the national agency, Education Scotland is to evaluate the quality of learning and teaching in schools.And inspections were meant to take place more regularly after the agency was criticised last year.Mr Lamont MP added: \"Education is meant to be the Scottish Governmentrsquos number one priority, so you would think there would be enough resources dedicated to be able to inspect our schools more regularly.ldquoAt this rate, it would take Education Scotland more than  years to get round each school in the Scottish Borders and that suggests to me that the system is not fit for purpose."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-binmen-miss-more-than-2000-collections-each-year","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council chiefs have been forced to admit they miss more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

But landscape photography has its own heartache as well. You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe. And at Loch Awe his eye was caught by the ldquototal flat calm of the reflection.ldquoThe two shots were bonus pictures, as I call them. Irsquom usually up at four in the morning when I leave Dunoon and Irsquom up north in pitch darkness, waiting for sunrise. Then I work my way through til about pm and I think, thatrsquoll do me.ldquoI shot both Buachaille and Loch Awe on my way home, though I donrsquot think they were on the same day.

The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds.

Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees.

In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

We know in any criminal trial the test is whether or not the prosecution has proved its case ldquobeyond reasonable doubt. If not, juries have to acquit. Which means not guilty ndash there is no middle way in the law. So why, in effect, have two not guilty verdicts Some lawyers, like Derek Ogg QC, have argued that logically it is the ldquonot guilty verdict that should go. This would concentrate jurorsrsquo minds on deciding whether or not the prosecution case had been ldquoproven beyond reasonable doubt. This is apparently how it was in Scottish courts in the th century. The ldquonot guilty verdict was reintroduced in the th century.However, many lawyers used to argue that the not proven verdict harmed the accused, not the accuser. Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable. But whether or not this will increase rape convictions is, well, not proven."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-christmas-festival-has-113m-boost-for-the-city-report-finds","story":"Underbelly, the major Fringe producers who also manage the Christmas festival and Hogmanay, said last years events - which include an ice rink, a market, a city centre fair and other attractions - drew , visitors.Over the six week run, the Christmas festival grew its audience by .%, which was up from , visitors the previous year, a report by BOP Consulting has found.Underbelly recently released an impact assessment, by the same company, for Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay which showed an economic impact for Edinburgh from the festival in   of poundm.Footfall to Edinburghrsquos Christmas three main sites was counted at .m.The centre of the city is transformed during the festival, with attractions, rides, food markets and a big wheel taking up Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square.More than , tickets were bought for Edinburghrsquos Christmas rides, attractions and shows last year.The majority of the attendees were from outside Edinburgh and the Lothian area.Of the % who came from outside the capital, around seven per cent came from  dferent countries including Australia, Ireland, USA, Holland, Spain, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand.Last year was the fth year of Underbelly produced Edinburghrsquos Christmas for the City of Edinburgh Council.

The truth is much more worrying ndash it simply hasnrsquot looked.When I sit with people on Universal Credit, it is the administrative chaos that is most obvious. Journalists have reported on many horric cases, but it is the everyday pressures caused by delays, computer issues, documents going missing, as well as the ever-present threat of sanctions, that reveal just how badly this system is failing many families.Universal Creditrsquos architects, the Centre for Social Justice and Iain Duncan Smith, have argued that it is spending cuts that have caused the problems. They have a point. Yet while the Budget partly reversed one of these cuts, Universal Credit bears the scars of eight years of cutbacks with much more planned.Churches, charities and claimants themselves have repeatedly said that Universal Credit leads many towards financial crisis and even hunger. The UK Government has vigorously rejected these claims, but has never backed this up with direct evidence.A Government survey of claimants showed that  in  families were struggling. In response the head of the Universal Credit programme admitted that the survey design means itrsquos not possible to tellUniversal Credit makes things better or worse. In the words of the National Audit Office, the DWP ldquodoes not know how many claimants are having problems withor have suffered hardship.William Beveridge designed the current benefit system  years ago with the express intention of ending poverty, or in his words the ldquogiant evil of ldquoWant. Today, the purpose of Universal Credit is very dferent.The purpose of Universal Credit is made clear in DWP documents that describe how the systemrsquos success or failure is judged. It aims to increase employment by \"changing the behaviours and attitudes of low-income families.Questions around families being able to cope, experiencing hardship or needing to use foodbanks simply do not appear. There is however copious data about peoplersquos job searches and their attitudes to work.The result is thatyou ask how strongly claimants agree with the statement \"any job is better than none the DWP can give you full and detailed answers. Ask whether those same families can feed their children and the silence will be deafening.A benefit system is always a balancing act between competing principles. Overall cost, incentivising work and ensuring that families have enough money have always been set against each other. Universal Credit strikes a new balance emphasising lower costs and work incentives. These necessarily come at the expense of providing an adequate income.Churches are seeing some of the human consequences of this new balance. Some impacts, such as the run on foodbanks, can be counted. We also hear stories of families needing help to get nappies for newborns, or unwell folk walking for hours to get to the Jobcentre because they cannot afford a bus.Today these peoplersquos experiences are being brushed under the carpet ndash but it is these peoplersquos voices that must be heardwe are to stop Universal Credit pushing families towards foodbanks.The Budget announcement of a few billion and further delays will not rescue Universal Credit.A properly funded ing benefit system has the potential to enable people held back by poverty to reach their full potential. However, this is impossible in families that are simply focusing on finding their next meal. The principle of preventing hardship must be reintroduced.Universal Credit needs a comprehensive overhaul where genuine poverty experts ndash those who face poverty every day ndash are included in the process. This is not an impractical pipe dream ndash Scotlandrsquos experience  are already helping design the new Scottish Social Security System.I do not know what the result of such a redesign would be but I do know that by tackling hunger and listening to those affected by the benefit system we have a much better chance of releasing the enormous potential that Universal Credit increasingly locks away.Rev Dr Richard Frazer is the Convener of the Church of Scotlandrsquos Church and Society Council"},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-handed-23m-of-public-money-early-to-shore-up-ailing-finances","story":"Bosses admitted to the payment after repeated questions from MSPs ndash but insisted it wouldnrsquot impact on the public purse.It comes after it emerged the number of trains being cancelled across Scotland has risen to a new high, with the latest figures showing an average of around  services were scrapped every day.ScotRail Alliance director Alex Hynes was asked about the early cash injection at Holyroodrsquos rural economy and connectivity committee.He repeatedly tried to avoid answering the question, before admitting: ldquoIts true to say that ScotRail has received some revenue support payments, which it is contractually due from April next year in advance of April next year.\"But that does not change the net amount of taxpayer subsidy to the franchise and its worth saying that these commercial discussions happen all the time between ScotRail and the Scottish Government and those changes are just one of the changes we discuss at regular intervals with Transport Scotland officials.\"ScotRail received pound million from Transport Scotland as a result of its cash problems.The payment was originally due to be handed over in April next year, but delays to electrication plans in the central belt meant it was brought forward.Figures show ScotRails pre-tax losses ballooned from pound. million in  to pound.m last year.Mr Hynes only admitted to the latest moveafter repeated questions from Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene and Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles.

It is far from traditional praise: Britains prime minister is, well, relatively normal.In an age of demagoguery, of populism and of Twitter tantrums, Mrs May also stands out as much for what she is not as for much as for what she is.Because - let us say it out loud - the prime minister is not Donald Trump. Imagine how Americas thin-skinned president would have responded to the kind of pressure his UK counterpart has endured The prime minister does not have the folksy easy charm of a Blair, or even a Clinton or a Bush. Voters probably would not want a beer with her. Or even a sherry. She may be of the right, but she is of the mainstream right. She can still fit on to a political spectrum of a European liberal democracy. A replacement may not.Speaking just as Mrs May was elected, PJ ORourke, the American republican commentator, through grinning but gritted teeth, endorsed Hillary Clinton. \"I mean, shes wrong about absolutely everything,\" he explained. \"But shes wrong within normal parameters.Would Boris Johnson be \"within normal parameters\"  Nigel Farage  Arron Banks Would Jeremy Corbyn  Maybe. But the Labour leader, even as the grim reality of Brexit becomes clear, cannot quite convince enough Britons he is PM material. Mrs Mays Tories, despite everything, despite a raging binfire over Europe, remain clear in the polls.David Cameron was blandly \"within normal parameters\". The Tory prime-minister-cum-PRman tried and failed his own balancing act between what was then called Eurosceptics and Europhiles. His solution was a referendum on EU membership. His Remainer side lost and he quit. Now there was a Weeble who wobbled and very much fell down.Mr Camerons party avoided a membership vote for a new leader - one Prof Keating reckons could never be won by a Remainer. Mrs May did not want Brexit.

Earlier in the day, prominent Leaver Peter Bone warned Mrs May she risked losing the support of \"many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country\".Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.\"The DUP, which props up Mrs Mayrsquos Government, has repeatedly insisted it will not back a deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.Last night, senior DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: \"Its a poor deal.

The full, -page text was published last night.It includes plans for a -month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March , as well as a so-called orce bill which is believed to be around pound billion.But controversy centres on plans for a ldquobackstop to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  ndash six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the European Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, told reporters in Brussels: \"In addition Northern Ireland will remain aligned to those rules of the single market that are essential for avoiding a hard border.Mr Rees-Mogg said the plans would see dferent rules for Northern Ireland, adding: ldquoThis is unacceptable to Unionists particularly in Northern Ireland, and Scotland where the SNP will seek to demand similar internal UK border to weaken the Union.The level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations that Mrs May faces further letters of no confidence from Tory MPs, with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources within Westminster said the delivery of letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was \"imminent\".Mrs May described the debate around the famous Cabinet table as \"long, detailed and impassioned\", in an apparent indication that her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers."},{"url":null,"title":"barnier-says-the-uks-draft-brexit-text-is-a-decisive-and-crucial-step","story":"He said the UK would remain \"a friend, a partner and an ally\", that there was \"still a lot of work\" to be done and that the future relationship will be on the basis of duty and quota-free trade.And he warned: \"The two negotiating teams have taken their responsibility. The British government has taken today its responsibility. Now, everybody on both sides has to take their responsibility.\"Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentrsquos Brexit coordinator, also backed the agreement, saying that negotiators had tried to ldquomake the best of the bad situation.Mr Barnier reassured the three million EU citizens in the UK and the one million British citizens living in an EU country that they could continue to live, study and work there throughout the transitional period and \"throughout their letime\".Britain would leave the EU and all its institutions on March ,  but there would be a planned transitional period to December ,  to \"allow business to prepare and adapt before implementation\".The UK has agreed to be bound by a UK-wide Brexit \"backstop\" which will effectively keep Britain in a customs union with the EUthe prime minister fails to secure an alternative arrangement before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.A customs union reduces administrative and financial trade barriers such as customs checks and charges, and boosts economic co-operation.Mr Barnier said the single EU-UK customs territory, of which Northern Ireland would be a part, would mean that UK goods get tarf and quota-free access to the EU market.The transitional period could be extended \"once\" for a limited period by joint agreement.And Mr Barnier was positive about the EU relationship with the UK saying: \"We are drawing the basis for an ambitious partnership, which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs co-operation in depth and with a level playing field.\"Our objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we are proposing in the withdrawal agreement, a single customs territory.\"He spoke after briefing ambassadors from the  member states in Brussels, as part of a carefully choreographed response to the agreement reached, including the controversial Irish backstop which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event this is not settled by a UK-EU trade deal.He explained that Northern Ireland would stay in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK but that the region would remain aligned to some EU regulations to avoid a hard border.That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to seethey meet EU rules \"in the least intrusive way possible\".Both sides resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.Mr Barnier saidthis is not possible by July , the transition period could be extended - andit is still not settled by the end of the transition, the backstop would \"kick in\".This would involve a joint UK-EU \"single customs territory\", so customs checks are not needed on the border.Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the EU single market rules that are \"essential for the avoidance of a hard border\", Mr Barnier added. He said the backstop plan had \"evolved considerably\" and had been based on the UKs proposal.He said: \"If we are not ready by July , we could jointly decide to extend the transition to provide for more time\"This backstop is not meant to be used. Our objective remains to reach a new agreement between the EU and the UK before the end of the transition.\"In closing, Mr Barnier said:\"It is the basis of a plan. We are going to start working with the  member states, and I will start tomorrow with the European Parliament on this draft political declaration.\"We have reached an important moment in this extraordinary negotiation which we entered into at the request of the United Kingdom. There is still a lot of work.\"I know that the path is still long and may well be dficult to guarantee an orderly withdrawal.

Across the board the response of our European friends is \"what the hell is the UK *doing* \"They respect the process that has led us to the result, but they do not understand why the UK has behaved as it has since.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmFollowing news that air traffic controllers from Highlands and Islands Airports Limitedare prepared to take industrial action over an ongoing pay dispute, Orkney MSP Liam McArthur has said the airport operator must take the threat to services seriously.

A special shuttle bus service took many people from Kirkwall for the event.The event began in blue skies and bright sunshine, many stayed throughout the day, only leaving as darkness fell.National Theatre of Scotland lead the events on the six Scottish beaches, supported locally by Orkney Islands Council.In addition to the portrait of Lieutenant Taylor, was the opportunity for people to create their own silhouettes in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict.In all, portraits were created at  beaches around the UK and the Republic of Ireland.They commemorated men and women who served or were casualties of the First World War. Most died during active service. Chosen by Danny Boyle, they represent the millions who gave their lives to the war.The project is the culmination of - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the First World War centenary. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services. We all need to be well prepared before driving in winter weather and drive according to conditions.Thursday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Former Justice and Housing minister Raab, who replaced David Davis in July, announced in a tweet that he had resigned from the Cabinet, although he paid tribute to the Prime Minister. Mr Raab, who backed Brexit in the  referendum, posted: “Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU. Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons, and my enduring respect for her.”Esther McVey announced her resignation around an hour later.: Brexit deal: What we know so farIn the letter, Mr Raab says that he cannot support the deal due to the proposed agreement’s proposals on Northern Ireland, which he argues is a ‘very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.”He goes on to criticise the ‘indefinite backstop’ arrangement, which he argues amounts to a form of veto held by the EU over the terms of Britain’s departure. The Esher and Walton MP concludes: “Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manesto at the last election.”Mr Raab and Ms McVey’s resignations were the first signs of cabinet-level revolt against Mrs May, although junior Northern Ireland Minister Shailesh Vara quit earlier this morning.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the resignations were a fatal blow to Theresa May’s leadership.“With ministers falling like dominos, it’s clear the Prime Minister lacks the confidence of her cabinet – and has no hope of commanding a majority in parliament for her bad Brexit deal.“Dominic Raab is the second Brexit Secretary to resign in just four months.“The Tory government is now consumed by chaos and lacks any authority whatsoever.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4818203.1542269317!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon don t bet on theresa may being pm through brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister has said she #wouldn#t put money# on Theresa May being in Number  by the time the UK leaves the EU.It comes as the Prime Minister is braced for a furious backlash from Tory Brexiteers over the withdrawal agreement’s content.Ms Sturgeon had voiced her dissatisfaction with the deal, but has now gone on to say Ms May could lose her position by March .She told ITV’s Peston programme: “The Prime Minister has proved to be resilient over the last months, so let’s not count her out in that respect.“I thought her language about the collective decision of the Cabinet - not a unanimous decision - said something.“I thought her body language looked very shaky, and I wouldn’t rule out Cabinet resignations tonight.: Brexit deal: What we know so far“I cannot see how she gets this deal through the House of Commons.”Ms Sturgeon has likened the deal to being “blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire”, claiming it posed a threat to jobs.In a phone call with the Prime Minister after the Cabinet meeting, she had rejected Mrs May’s assertion that Scotland’s interests had been protected in the deal.“I pointed out that there isn’t a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage,” she said.However, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said it would be worse for Scotland to crash out with no agreement, so he was happy to give it his backing.Ms Sturgeon said: “It is obvious that the Prime Minister can barely unite her Cabinet on this deal and it is also increasingly clear that she will struggle to get a majority for it in Parliament.: Theresa May wins Cabinet support for Brexit deal“In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a  choice between a bad deal and no deal.“No-one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire.“This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards.“If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament, then the UK Government mustto the negotiating table to secure a better one.“Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union.”Mrs May described the debate around the famous Cabinet table as “long, detailed and impassioned”, in an apparent indication that her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers.Predicted resignations did not materialise, as Mrs May said ministers had come to a “collective decision” to back the document agreed by UK and EU negotiators in Brussels.The Cabinet’s agreement clears the way for a special Brexit summit in Brussels - probably on November  - for EU leaders to approve the deal, followed by a crucial Commons vote in which MPs will hold Britain’s future in their hands.Mrs May said she will outline the deal to MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday.Mr Mundell said: “The worst possible outcome for Scotland and the whole of the UK would be a no deal departure from the EU.”Meanwhile, Scottish Greens Europe spokesman Ross Greer MSP said: “This is a bad deal for Scotland. Holyrood should debate it and reject it as soon as possible.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: “This is a bad deal for the country.“Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - one that guarantees standards and protections.“The Tories have let down the country with their bungled negotiations and pushed Britain towards a bad deal that will harm jobs, rights and living standards.“The deal undermines the integrity of the UK and would be another example of the Tories playing into the hands of the SNP by putting the future of the UK at risk through their ineptitude and recklessness.“Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resignthe integrity of the UK was put at risk - and it appears Theresa May has simply ignored them.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826977.1541765540!/image/image.jpg","title":"nile rodgers interview bringing chic to scotland","story":"The music legend talks to Janet Christie about a le dedicated to getting people dancing, working with Bowie and Madonna and theof good times ahead of Chic#s Glasgow gigMusic legend Nile Rodgers has his guitar strapped to his back. He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

The Scottish Secretary came under fresh pressure to resign after Mr Raab quit this morning over Theresa May’s draft withdrawal agreement, warning it would damage the union.: Calls for David Mundell to quit as he defends Theresa May’s Brexit deal Speaking to ITV Border’s Peter McMahon, Mr Mundell said: “I’m not taking lessons on standing up for our United Kingdom from carpetbaggers.“Only a couple of years ago Dominic Raab was proposing to introduce a bill of rights into Scotland that would have overridden the Scottish legal system and devolution, so I’m not impressed by his latter-day commitment to the Union. I’m sure this is more about manoeuvring and leadership. I’m absolutely committed to the integrity of the United Kingdom. “I made clear at the cabinet yesterday that I needed to understand in greater detail the  pages of the Northern Ireland protocol and be satisfied that they didn’t indeed compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, but I also take very seriously my job in ensuring that Scotland and the United Kingdom get the best possible Brexit that doesn’t also threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and that’s what I’m still committed to doing.“I believe that the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together is to ensure that we have a deal as we leave the EU, that Brexit delivers for Scotland and the rest of the UK, and that’s what I’m focused on, not being part of some soap opera of resignations, and I’m not going to be bounced into resigning by carpetbaggers.”Mr Mundell said he backed the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement put before the cabinet on Wednesday despite widespread concern over provisions on Northern Ireland and fisheries.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large.

What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army.

There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

As part of the application the agent has included details of a study carried out to identy suitable existing town centre sites. “The study extended to both Carrickfergus and Larne and identied six alternative locations. These were assessed against a set criteria and discounted.“The existing buildings primarywas as Class B office use albeit ancillary to the main industrial use of the former Michelin factory. The site benefits from existing transport infrastructure and car parking facilities.”Mr McGuinness added that given “the lack of a Civic HQ” Mid and East Antrim Council have been highlighted as the “prospective end user”.He continued: “The existing industrial use of the Michelin site has ceased with a signicant loss of employment for the local economy. The reuse of this existing site would reintroduce employment to this site and potentially attract other businesses”.The Planning Officer concluded: “Given the fact that the proposed building is an existing office block and would therefore limit precedent the shortage of suitable office accommodation in Ballymena town centre the fact that Mid and East Antrim Council do not currently benefit from a Civic HQ and that by council locating facilities at Michelin may encourage further investment at this location, on balance, the proposed change of use is considered an acceptable other use,limited to a temporary period allowing it to be reconsidered in the future under the prevailing policy at that time.”He said the change of use shall be for a temporary period of six years, commencing from the date of approval.The Planning Department recommended that the committee approve the application.It was proposed by Councillor Audrey Wales and seconded by Alliance Councillor Robert Logan that members approve the recommendation. This was agreed with eight members voting in favour of the proposal.

I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

Mrs Foster described the meeting at the Prime Ministers office in the House of Commons as \"frank\".\"She is fully aware of our position and concerns,\" the DUP leader added in a terse tweet later.It is understood that after the meeting Mrs Foster held a short meeting with Belfast-born Labour MP Kate Hoey, an ardent Brexiteer. Mr Dodds was said to have been \"in deep conversation\" with Tory MP Steve Baker, a leading figure in the pro-Brexit European Research Group , for around  minutes at around the same time.One of the key elements the deal covers is the so-called backstop intended to ensure there is noto the hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republicnegotiations on the future relationship have still not been completed.The deal will create a single EU-UK customs territory with the UK continuing to follow EU tarfs and customs rules, avoiding the need for checks between the EU and UK - including between Northern Ireland and the Republic.However, Northern Ireland will be required to remain aligned with what the EU calls \"a limited set of EU rules that are indispensable for avoiding a hard border\".These include some EU single market rules, including legislation on VAT and excise in respect of goods, agricultural production, veterinary controls and state aid rules.This crosses one of the DUPs red lines, and the party is expected to vote against the deal in Parliament.Mrs Foster, whose party props up Mrs Mays minority administration in the Commons, had earlier warned the PM there would be \"consequences\"her deal treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.Mrs May described the debate around the Cabinet table as \"long, detailed and impassioned\", in a clear indication her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers.There were no threats to resign during the meeting, which ended with ministers toasting the agreement with red and white wine.Rumours of possible walkouts continued to swirl around Westminster, however, and the level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations of further letters of no confidence in Mrs May from Tory MPs.Sources said the delivery of letters to the chairman of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was \"imminent\", with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on Mrs Mays position.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement that \"decisive progress\" had been made, clearing the way for a special summit for leaders of the remaining  EU states to give their stamp of approval, probably on November .Speaking outside  Downing Street minutes after the crunch Cabinet meeting concluded, Mrs May acknowledged she faced \"dficult days ahead\" as she prepares to seek the backing of the House of Commons in what is expected to be the toughest vote of her parliamentary career. She said: \"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.\"The text approved by the Cabinet will provide the basis of a legally binding treaty. It covers the future rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals in the EU, the UKs £bn \"orce\" settlement, as well as protocols on Gibraltar and the UK sovereign base areas in Cyprus.It also provides for a transition period after the UK leaves in March  running to the end of , with the option of a one-off extensionmore time is needed to conclude an agreement on the future relationship.Senior UK Government officials said the final text of the withdrawal agreement featured important gains for the UK on the backstop arrangements to be implementedno trade deal can be reached.The outline political declaration - which will be subject to further negotiation over the coming weeks - expresses an ambition to achieve zero tarfs and no quotas in EU-UK trade, something the officials said no other major economy had achieved.The facilitated customs arrangements and \"common rulebook\" proposed in Mrs Mays Chequers plan are replaced by the concept of a \"sliding scale\" of commitments and market access, which means the UK would not be tied to an off-the-shelf deal of the kind previously offered to countries such as Canada.\"We are for the very first time opening up a world where we can do the sort of trade deal the EU has never done before,\" one UK official said.Under backstop arrangements designed to keep the Irish border open,no trade deal is agreed by the end of the transition period in December , a temporary \"EU-UK single customs territory\" would be established.This could be terminated only by mutual consent of Brussels and London but each side would be legally bound to make \"best endeavours\" to bring it to an end by sealing a permanent deal on their future relations.There will be a provision to allow the two sides to extend the transition to a fixed date rather than activate the backstop.A five-person arbitration , with two representatives of each side and one independent member, will be set up to rule on disputes, with the chair chosen by drawing lotsmembers cannot agree. Mrs May described the deal as \"the best that could be negotiated\".She added: \"When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear - this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union, or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.\"But arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote to Tory MPs calling on them not to support Mrs Mays plan, arguing the UK would \"hand over £bn to the EU for little or nothing in \". The deal is \"unacceptable to unionists\", will \"lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws\" and is \"profoundly undemocratic\", Mr Rees-Mogg said."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland office minister resigns over draft brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP will owe an apology and an explanation to the people who voted for them on the basis of More votes. More seats. More influence. More for Northern Ireland.\"Well what exactly were they doing with their influence \"A stark example is that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules which includes VAT and excise in respect of goods and state aid rules, so rather than the prospect of being the best of both worlds, this would restrict any potential opportunity.\"Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill accused the DUP of using \"reckless language\" and added: \"The backstop is the only insurance policy we have. This has been a mess, a debacle. There is no good to come from Brexit. There is no magic deal sitting waiting to be done.\"My message to Theresa May is simple and clear. We, the four main pro-Remain parties, speak for the majority of people in the north. The DUP do not speak for the majority.\"We need to protect our economy and that is about staying in the Customs Union, the single market. That is about the backstop being permanent, there unless or until something better comes along.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MLA called on Arlene Foster and the DUP to \"cut the hysteria\" and \"act on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland\".Mr Eastwood said: \"The reaction to a reported Brexit deal by the DUP is both flippant and irrational.\"I would remind Arlene Foster that her first priority is to defend political stability and the economic future of our people here. Its time for cool heads, not kneejerk reactions.\"The best Brexit deal is no Brexit at all but this draft agreement seeks to protect Ireland from a hard border. There is a proper backstop that protects citizens and businesses here.\"The Good Friday Agreement is protected, including the principle of consent. Unionists should be comfortable that there will only be constitutional change when a majority votes for it. This agreement is about protecting and enhancing our economy and protecting our peace process.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long also said while she is relieved a potential agreement between the EU and UK is closer, there remains no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit.Mrs Long said Alliances preference remained a Peoples Vote on the deal.\"We are relieved there is a potential agreement between the EU and UK on a Withdrawal Agreement, including a backstop which meets the conditions set out in Joint Report from December  and which is supported by representatives of the majority of people in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"The backstop is not a threat to the constitutional position here. Rather it is an insurance policy based on existing precedents, and helping us to better survive Brexit.\"However, there is nothing to celebrate because there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. The backstop is a last resort safety net, the bare minimum to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border. But only as insurance against a much worse fate. Practically, it is a third party fire and theft policy rather than a fully comprehensive one.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland sold out by prime minister in eu negotiations mps told","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So much for standing up for Scotland’s place in the UK.“If David Mundell had a back bone then he would resign with immediate effect.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit draft agreement read entire 585","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit draft agreement: Read entire  page document Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  - six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Below is a fact sheet produced by the European Commission on Northern Ireland.Protocol on Ireland and Northern IrelandBrussels,  November Questions  AnswersWhat has been agreed on Ireland and Northern Ireland The EU and UK negotiators have agreed in full on the terms of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.The Protocol includes all the provisions on how the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would work. This forms part of the overall Withdrawal Agreement and will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. Both the EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty a subsequent agreement by  July .As part of the Protocol, a single EU-UK customs territory is established from the end of the transition period until the future relationship becomes applicable. Northern Ireland will therefore remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK with no tarfs, quotas, or checks on rules of origin between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK[].The Protocol also sets out the UKs commitment to no diminution of rights as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , and provides for the continuation of the Common Travel Area arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. It ensures that the necessary conditions for continued North-South cooperation are maintained, and preserves the Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland.This agreement addresses in full the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. It is the insurance policy that guarantees that, whatever the circumstances, there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and it will protect the Good FridayAgreement  in all its dimensions, North-South cooperation, and the all-island economy. How will the backstop work If an agreement on the future EU-UK relationship is not applicable by  December , the EU and the UK have agreed that a backstop solution will apply until such a time as a subsequent agreement is in place.Alternatively, the UK may, before  July , request an extension of the transition period. Such a request would be dealt with under article  of the Withdrawal Agreement and must therefore be agreed by the Joint Committee.In the scenario where the \"backstop solution\" would apply, this would mean the following in practice:There will be a single EU-UK customs territory. This will avoid the need for tarfs, quotas or checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK have agreed on a set of measures to ensure that there is a level playing field between the EU and the UK.The Unions Customs Code , which sets out, inter alia, the provisions for releasing products into free circulation within the EU, will continue to apply to Northern Ireland. This will ensure that Northern Irish businesses will not face restrictions when placing products on the EUs Single Market.The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules that are related to the EUs Single Market and indispensable for avoiding a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. Why do you need a backstop The United Kingdom has decided to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. Both the EU and the UK have committed to avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and both Parties intend to solve this first and foremost through a future agreement.The UK has also committed to respecting the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union – and Irelands place in it.Given that negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship will only be conducted during the transition period, the EU and the UK have agreed to include a legally operational backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, which guarantees that no hard border s – whatever the circumstances. This was agreed in the Joint Report in December  and reiterated by Prime Minister Theresa May in her letter to President Tusk in March , through which the UK government committed to have a legally operative backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. How long will the backstop apply for The aim of the Protocol is not to create a permanent relationship between the EU and the UK. The EU and the UK have committed that they will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty an agreement by  July  which would replace the backstop as contained in the Protocol, in whole or in part. Is there any review mechanism foreseen  Can the EU or the UK ask to stop applying the backstop in whole or in part If at any time after the transition period, the EU or the UK considers that this Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary, it may noty the other party, setting out its reasons. The Joint Committee [as established in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement] will consider the notication and may seek an opinion from institutions created by the Good FridayAgreement . Following discussions in the Joint Committee, the EU and the UK may decide jointly that the Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives. What is the “Single Customs Territory” The EU and the UK have today agreed that a single EU-UK customs territory will apply from the end of the transition period until such a time as a subsequent agreement becomes applicable. This single customs territory will comprise of the customs territory of the UnionNo   and the customs territory of the United Kingdom.This means that:the UK will align the tarfs and rules applicable to its customs territory to the Unions external tarfs and rules of originthere will therefore be no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK, with the exception of fishery and aquaculture productsboth the EU and the UK have agreed on a series of measures ensuring a level playing fieldthe UK will harmonise its commercial policy with the EUs common commercial policy to the extent necessary for the ing of the single customs territory. Under no circumstances can the UK apply a lower customs tarf to its customs territory than the EU Common Customs Tarf for any good imported from any third country or apply dferent rules of origin.The Union shall apply its trade defence policy and Generalised System of Preferences to both parts of the single customs territory it shall consult the UK on any measures or actions which it considers taking. What “level playing field” measures have been agreed The UK has committed to a level playing field based on open and fair competition between the EU and the UK given the establishment of the single customs territory with no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK. The economic interconnectedness of the UK and the EU as well as the UKs geographic proximity to the EU are key elements to take into account when regulating the proper ing of open and fair competition in the single customs territory.The Protocol binds the UK to substantive rules, based on international and EU standards. Apart from competition rules, it is based on the principle of non-regression from the current levels of protection under international and EU standards. State aidThe United Kingdom has committed to apply EU state aid rules, in a way that is dynamically aligned to the development of those rules in the EU.For aid granted by the UK that affects trade between Northern Ireland and the EU, the Commission will continue to enforce State aid rules directly as part of the backstop solution. The Court of Justice of the EU also remains competent in this respect.For State aid granted by the UK affecting trade flows only between the rest of the UK and the EU, the UK will set up an independent enforcement authority, which will work in close cooperation with the Commission. UK courts will supervise the independent enforcement authority. The Commission will have legal standing before UK courts and the right to intervene in cases.The Withdrawal Agreement ensures close cooperation between the Union and the UK. The UK state aid authority will regularly consult with the Commission. A Joint Committee will allow both Parties to discuss matters of interest and seek commonly acceptable solutions to disagreements. In case no mutually agreed solution can be found, interim measures and an arbitration system are foreseen in case of unresolved conflicts. CompetitionThe EU and the UK acknowledge that anti-competitive business practices and concentrations of undertakings have the potential to distort the ing of markets and undermine the benefits of trade.In this light, the EU and the UK agree that certain agreements between undertakings, the abuse of dominance by undertakings, and certain concentrations of undertakings must be prohibited in so far as they affect trade between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK commit to ensuring that their respective competition laws effectively enforce these agreed rules. More concretely, the UK commits to ensure that administrative and judicial proceedings are available in order to permit the effective and timely action against violations of competition rules, and provide for effective remedies. In case of disputes about whether the UK complies with these commitments, dispute settlement through arbitration is available. TaxationThe UK has committed to implementing the principles of good governance in the area of tax, as recently agreed by the Council. These include global standards on transparency and exchange of information, fair taxation and OECD-BEPS standards. It will continue to apply its domestic law which transposes the EU Directives on the exchange of information on taxation, anti-tax avoidance rules and Country-by-Country-Reporting by credit institutions and investment firms. Moreover, the UK reaffirms its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU Code of Conduct.The implementation of this commitment will be addressed by the Joint-Committee. EnvironmentThe EU and the UK have committed to maintain the current level of environmental protection. Both Parties have committed not to lower the EUs existing environmental standards in key areas such as industrial emissions, air quality targets, nature and bioersity protection and environmental impact assessments. The UK will abide by key environmental principles, such as the \"polluter pays\" and the precautionary principle. Furthermore, the Joint Committee will - based on existing EU standards - lay down specic minimum commitments on issues such as pollution, sulphur in marine fuel and use of best available techniques governing industrial emissions.The EU and the UK have also agreed to take the necessary measures to meet their respective commitments to international agreements to address climate change, including the Paris Agreement. Finally, the UK will implement a system of carbon pricing that is at least as effective as the EU Emission Trading Scheme for greenhouse emission allowances.The UK has committed to ensuring the effective enforcement of such common standards in its law, regulations and practices and to set up a new independent body with the task of monitoring, reporting, overseeing and enforcing these commitments. The new independent authority will be able to receive complaints and conduct own-initiative inquiries and bring legal action before a domestic court for remedial action. In this context, the UK has committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings which will give the right to authorities and members of the public to seek effective remedies and obtain sanctions that are effective, proportionate, dissuasive and deterrent. Labour and social protectionA non-regression provision also applies to labour and social protection standards. The EU and the UK have committed not to reduce their common level of protection provided by their laws, regulations and practices as a result of the implementation of Union law and ratied international conventions, such as the International Labour Organisation conventions and the Council of Europes Social Charter.This includes provisions in relation to fundamental rights at work, such as non-discrimination and equal pay, occupational health and safety, fair working conditions and employment standards, and social rights related to restructuring of companies.The UK will ensure effective enforcement through existing domestic authorities and an effective system of labour inspections. The UK has also committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings. How will these “level playing field” measures be enforced The enforcement of State aid and competition rules is outlined above.The maintenance of the same level of social and environmental protection will be subject to dispute resolution in the Joint Committee. Disputes on the effectiveness of the UKs monitoring and enforcement of the common standards can, in addition, be brought to arbitration.In taxation, an infringement by the UK of applying the domestic legal rules which transpose EU tax directives covered by the Agreement will be subject to judicial dispute settlement with the possibility of sanctions.The Union will be able to adopt unilateral measures either under the Agreement or on the basis of Union law, and in line with international commitments. These measures may include the possibility to temporarily suspend obligations in the case of non-compliance with an arbitration ruling, safeguards or rebalancing measures , the listing of uncooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes, or action for health and environmental protection in line with international commitments . How can you include a UK-wide customs union in the Withdrawal Agreement  Is it not part of the future relationship The Withdrawal Agreement under Article  can wind down or phase out existing situations or it can provide a bridge to the future relationship.This means that the Withdrawal Agreement may include elements that form the basis on which arrangements in the future relationship are built. The Protocol is therefore only intended to apply temporarily, unless and until a subsequent EU-UK agreement is put in place. Will Northern Ireland be in a dferent customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom No. Northern Ireland will form part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, which forms a single customs territory with the EU.However, under the backstop and in order to avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland businesses can place products on the EUs internal market without restriction. Placing goods on the internal market that come from outside of Northern Ireland requires that the processes provided for in the Union Customs Code will have to be applied. Will fisheries be included in the “Single Customs Territory” Arrangements on fisheries will be negotiated as part of the overall future partnership. The EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to agree on a fisheries and aquaculture agreement by  July . An essential condition for this single customs territory to cover fisheries and aquaculture products will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities. We have shared objectives to ensure fishing at sustainable levels and promote resource conservation Will Northern Ireland remain aligned to the rules and regulations of the EU  Will Northern Ireland have to apply the EUs Customs Code In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction, it will be necessary for the UK in respect of Northern Ireland to maintain specic regulatory alignment with the EU, as has been agreed between the EU and the UK in the December  Joint Report.This means that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules that are indispensable for avoiding a hard border, namely:legislation on VAT and excise in respect of goodslegislation on goods standardssanitary rules for veterinary controls rules on agricultural production marketingstate aid rules.As explained above, the EUs Customs Code will also continue to apply in Northern Ireland within the overall context of the single customs territory between the EU and the UK. Will Northern Ireland remain part of the UKs VAT area Yes, Northern Ireland will remain part of the UKs VAT area, with HMRC remaining responsible for the operation and collection of VAT, and the setting of VAT rates across the UK, in line with the VAT directive. Specically, the UK will ensure that no business is required to pay VAT upfront when moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that accounting for VAT can continue to be done through postponed accounting and VAT s.However, to ensure that Northern Ireland continues to be able to operate the EUs VIES systemand to share data with Ireland, Northern Ireland will be required to remain aligned to EU VAT rules, but only with respect to goods. Will there need to be checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland There will be no need for checks or controls on goods or persons crossing the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. There will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The Common Travel Area can also continue to . The UK has committed that this will not affect the obligations of Ireland under Union law, in particular with respect to free movement of EU citizens and their family members to, from and within Ireland. What checks will need to take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK In order to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction – and given the island of Irelands status as a single epidemiological area – there would be a need for checks on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland. There would be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards, consistent with risk, to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market.The EU and the UK have agreed to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible. The scale and frequency of the checks could be further reduced through future agreements between the EU and the UK.For industrial goods, checks are based on risk assessment, and can mostly take place in the market or at traders premises by the relevant authorities. Such checks will always be carried out by UK authorities.As for agricultural products, already existing checks at ports and airports will need to continue, but will be increased in scale in order to protect the EUs Single Market, its consumers and animal health. Will Northern Irish businesses still have unfettered access to the rest of the UK Nothing in this Protocol prevents unfettered market access for Northern Ireland products in the rest of the UK. Nothing in this text prevents a product originating from Northern Ireland as being considered as a UK good when placed on the market in the rest of the UK. Who will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland The authorities of the United Kingdom will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland. The EU will have the right to obtain information and request control measures. The UK will facilitate any requests made by EU representatives. The practical arrangements for this will be determined by the Joint Committee, following a proposal from the Specialised Committee. How will certication and product approval work in Northern Ireland Where existing EU law provides for the possibility for an authority body in another Member State to issue product approvals certicates, this option should be used by Northern Irish businessesthey want to export to the EU Member States.On the other hand, Northern Irish businesses can rely on authorisation via UK authorities . UK authorities would apply Union law in respect of Northern Ireland, and could decide to make such certicates valid UK-wide.Products from Northern Ireland can continue to be labelled or marketed as UK products throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. Where EU law on goods is concerned, Northern Irish products shall be indicated as \"UK\". A relevant example would be regarding ear tags for live animals. What guarantees does the backstop provide to protect the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will apply the Union customs code and remain aligned to EU rules and standards on goods. Authorisations by UK authorities for products to be placed on the market, as well as technical regulations, assessments, registrations, certicates and approvals issued by UK authorities or bodies in the UK will be valid for Northern Ireland only. If a Northern Irish business wants to place a product on both the Northern Irish market and the EU Single Market, an authorisation from an EU Member State authority or body will be necessary. Will the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice extend to Northern Ireland The Withdrawal Agreement will have direct effect. This means that UK courts will, in practice, apply this agreement, in the same way as they apply EU law today. The European Court of Justice is the ultimate arbiter of EU law. For issues related to EU law concepts outlined in the Withdrawal Agreement, including aspects of the Protocol, the ECJ will remain the ultimate arbiter. For all other areas of the Protocol, the enforcement and dispute resolution arrangements provided in the Withdrawal Agreement will apply. What  does the Protocol contain beyond the \"backstop\" The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland also contains provisions that address a number of other unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, beyond issues related to customs and regulatory matters, most notably:The Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom and its associated rights and privileges will continue to apply in conformity with EU law, in particular on free movement of EU citizens. The UK will ensure that there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , including with regard to EU law on non-discrimination. This commitment will be implemented and monitored through dedicated mechanisms.The Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland.North-South cooperation will continue, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as in the areas of energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The report will be published shortly. How will the commitment to no diminution of “Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity” as outlined in the Good FridayAgreement  work The UK will remain bound by the obligations it entered into as a co-guarantor to the Good FridayAgreement .The UK has confirmed its commitment to ensure no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity set out in the Good FridayAgreement. This includes a commitment to no diminution in rights in the area of non-discrimination at the time of or following its withdrawal from the European Union and Annex  lists the existing EU Directives that have been adopted by the European Union in this area. The commitment to no diminution applies further to all rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity concepts set out in the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.Article  of the Protocol provides that the UK will implement this paragraph through dedicated mechanisms. Article  provides that the United Kingdom will continue to facilitate the work of the institutions and bodies established under the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.The United Kingdom will set out further information on its commitments in this respect. Will Irish citizens in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, but a great number of people born and raised there will continue to be EU citizens. They will continue to enjoy their rights as Union citizens under the Treaties. Under the Treatythey will in particular continue to enjoy the following rights:non-discrimination on the basis of nationalitymove and reside freely within the EUconsular protection petition the European Parliament and complain to the European ombudsmancontact and receive a response from any EU institution in one of the EUs official languagesaccess European Parliament, European Commission and Council documents under certain conditionsaccess to the EU Civil Service What will happen to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes The EU and the UK are committed to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework and to maintaining the current funding proportions for the future programme. The Commission has already proposed the continuation of PEACE and INTERREG for Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland beyond  under a single programme PEACE PLUS. It will now be for Member States, with the consent of the European Parliament, to decide on this. What is North South Cooperation and how will it be protected in the context of the UKs withdrawal   Cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good FridayAgreement and is essential for achieving reconciliation on the island of Ireland.In implementing the Protocol, the conditions necessary for continued North-South Cooperation will be maintained in a range of areas including the environment, health, agriculture, transport, education, tourism, energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The protocol recognises that, in full respect of Union law, new arrangements building on the provisions of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement in these and in other areas of North-South cooperation, can continue to be made on the island of Ireland.Both parties have recognised that the UKs departure from the EU gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North South Cooperation.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

participated in lsquoThe Yellow Linersquo were invited to a private event in Stormontrsquos Parliament Buildings to celebrate their involvement and take part in the second part of the project, the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliamentrsquo.During the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliament,rsquo Stormont became a space for the voices of the Border people as they considered matters of global political signicance that to them are intensely local.Throughout the evening these conversations were recorded to be used in future exhibitions of the project.At the end of the evening at Stormont, participants were encouraged to write down fundamental principals about their lives and their landscapes, highlighting what Border le means to them.These musings will be collated by writer Garrett Carr to create a collective statement about Border le, which will be published as the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliament: Yellow Manestorsquo.The evening concluded with a special viewing of lsquoThe Yellow Linersquo which was projected on to the wall of the Ulster Museum in Belfast. Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many will read his words as being a clear reference to paramilitary violence and intimidation used during the Troubles in Northern Ireland by terrorist groups.“Politicians set the tone. In this time of ision and rancour we must debate with respect and care.”Mr Wilson is well known for his robust and outspoken approach.In January, he expressed regret for calling Taoiseach Leo Varadkar “a nutcase”.Last month, he branded Mr Varadkar “despicable, low and rotten”.try catch     .               ..

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Just last month the council’s chief executive Roger Wilson was quoted as saying: ‘We are proactively developing a high-quality business infrastructure, boosting skills in the region, supporting economic development and promoting the borough as being very much open for business.’ “City Deal ticks all of those boxes and more, and our borough’s vital strategic location would surely have made it the ideal location to benefit from the City Deal bid. The fact that councils as far away as Newry and Mourne have secured their place at the Belfast region city deal table, gives me even more cause for concern as to why Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon are missing. “Just last week ABC council announced it had written to the Chancellor alongside Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh and Omagh councils to ask for a Treasury backed scheme, and Northern Ireland’s rd city deal. This leads me to ask why theyare not included in the Belfast city deal, when others were.“You just have to look at our neighbours to see what is being outlined. The Newry Southern Relief Road, for example, will be an invaluable addition to the area. In County Antrim, Carrickfergus is earmarked for around £m of investment in its town centre. My constituency of Upper Bann is crying out for similar investment, and was geographically and economical well placed to be included.”A spokesperson for the Council said ABC Council “set out its plans to explore mechanisms for a Growth Deal in collaboration with Fermanagh  Omagh District Council and Mid Ulster District Council in a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond. “We believe that working with our two neighbouring councils – which represent one quarter of Northern Ireland’s population – we have a strong chance of securing a Growth Deal which will work to boost economic growth and deliver a step-change to the future prospects of the collective area. It will work alongside the Belfast City Region Deal and the proposed Derry Londonderry City Deal to bolster the NI economy as a whole.”Police investigate war memorial incident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
