He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day. Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event.‘They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.’However, Dolphin also contradicted the assertion by Kavanaugh’s lawyers that the two shared a brief kiss in high school.‘I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,’ she told The New York Times through her lawyer.Kavanaugh was one of 13 graduating seniors who reportedly mentioned Dolphin in some way in the yearbook. One former student, Michael Walsh, wrote a poem in his yearbook that said: ‘You need a date  and it\u0027s getting late  so don\u0027t hesitate  to call Renate.’According to a person close to Dolphin, she was aware of the poem being recited by her former classmates and requested that they stop saying it.Kavanaugh has come under intense scrutiny lately for allegedly sexually assaulting former classmates Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. Both he and Ford are scheduled to testify in the U.S. Senate on Thursday, September 27.Ryder Cup 2018: Teams, matches and schedule revealedWho is Kamala Harris?

View days: Multiple sources tell DailyMail.com that Rosie O\u0027Donnell is the top choice, while other names being floated around include Ann Curry and Lisa Ling (O\u0027Donnell and Barbara Walters on The View)          Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime. We are grateful for her many other contributions, respect her decision and wish Julie all the best in everything she does.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/21/4E919DF000000578-0-image-a-5_1532550973907.jpg","title":"Who Kamala Harris Senator revealed amid talk 2020 President run","story":"    Kamala Harris began her questioning of Christine Blasey Ford by praising her and reminding her she was not on trial      Ryder Cup 2018: Teams, matches and schedule revealedWho is Kamala Harris?

The lifting of student number controls in England in 2015 gave universities free rein to recruit as many undergraduates as they saw fit.The Government’s Higher Education Initial Participation Rate is an estimate of the likelihood of a young person studying for a sub-degree, first degree or a postgraduate course by the age of 30, based on current participation rates. By this measure, participation rose by 0.7 percentage points from 49.1 per cent in 201516 to 49.8 per cent in 201617.The Department for Education dataset – which rounds up the proportion to 50 per cent – says this equates to 333,490 students, up from 332,000.Those entering higher education immediately after school also reached a record high last year, with 28 per cent of 18-year-olds in study. This is the fourth year in a row this measure has increased.          Students in England are predicted to graduate with average debts of £50,800Last week, Education Secretary Damian Hinds toured Germany and Holland to learn more about their vocational education systems. He attacked ‘snobbery’ and ‘outdated attitudes’ towards vocational qualifications, insisting children at every type of school must be aware of the ‘range of possibilities’, including degree apprenticeships.He stressed that for many young people ‘the right choice will be to go to university – but for some it might not be’.Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ‘These figures highlight that young people up and down the country clearly recognise the value of studying at one of our world-class universities, and we want that to continue.‘We recognise there is more to do to level the playing field and ensure more people with the talent and potential get a fair crack of the whip wherever they live.’The Government is carrying out a review of post-18 education and funding ‘to ensure that the system provides genuine choice and opportunity for everyone’. "},{"url":null,"title":"David Hockney unveils stained glass countryside tribute Queen","story":"    David Hockney has unveiled a stained glass window tribute to the Queen at Westminster Abbey, saying: \u0027I hope she\u0027ll like it\u0027The brightly-coloured abstract window of yellow, red, blue, pink, orange and greens, features hawthorn blossom and stands out in its historic setting.Hockney said the iPad was \u0027a natural thing to use\u0027 because it is \u0027back-lit like a window\u0027.The much-loved artist, who recently broke his own auction record with a £21.1 million painting, said that designing his first stained glass window \u0027was a challenge\u0027 adding: \u0027I\u0027ve learnt something about glass.\u0027Stunning wall hanging painted by soldiers returning from the...Never-before-seen letter from Wallis Simpson that hints at...Hamleys reveal their top 12 Christmas toys including Crate...Share this articleHe said of wanting to depict the countryside: \u0027Landscape is nature.

Spanning over eight metres high, the new work at Westminster Abbey is the 81-year-old artist\u0027s first in stained glass          Designed on his iPad and set in Hockney\u0027s Yorkshire birthplace, it reflects the Queen\u0027s love for, and connection with, the countryside\u0027It\u0027s a rather celebratory thing.

David Hockney poses in front of The Queen\u0027s Window, a new stained glass window he has designed, at Westminster Abbey          The much-loved artist, who recently broke his own auction record with a £21.1 million painting, said that designing his first stained glass window \u0027was a challenge\u0027 adding: \u0027I\u0027ve learnt something about glass\u0027But he said of British politics: \u0027I don\u0027t really know that much about it actually, I don\u0027t care that much…. There are always crisis. There\u0027s always this, there\u0027s always that. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s going on now. But I\u0027m staying out of it.\u0027Hockney, famous for both his Yorkshire landscapes and paintings of Californian life, was inspired by Matisse, Chagall \u0027and a few other people\u0027 for the new work.He was asked to design something symbolic or representational, rather than a figurative design.Westminster Abbey said that the result \u0027reflects the Queen as a countrywoman and her widespread delight in, and yearning for, the countryside\u0027.          The brightly-coloured abstract window of yellow, red, blue, pink, orange and greens, features hawthorn blossom and stands out in its historic setting  Hockney was commissioned to create the stained glass window at Westminster Abbey to celebrate Queen Elizabeth\u0027s reign The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, added: \u0027I\u0027m excited by it.\u0027I think there\u0027s absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and different.\u0027Some of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautiful, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.\u0027He added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be here until the end. I mean, who knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future! The Abbey\u0027s only been here just over 1,000 years. It\u0027ll be thousands more.\u0027He said of the Queen: \u0027She\u0027s obviously seen a sketch but she\u0027ll see it in person when she\u0027s here in November.\u0027You wouldn\u0027t necessarily get very much reaction out of the Queen.

Here’s all you need to know about her, including her relationship with Kavanaugh and the allegations she’s made against him.Who is Julie Swetnick?Julie Swetnick is the third woman to publicly allege that U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct.Swetnick, 55, currently lives in Washington, D.C. and attended the University of Maryland and Montgomery College.She’s reportedly spent years working for the Federal government in Washington, D.C., including currently at the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Mint and has previously held security clearances for the Department of Justice, the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security.Additionally, she’s also believed to have previously worked with the Vietnam War Commission and is reportedly one of the first 100 women in the entire world to have earned a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineering Certification.While attending high school in Gaithersburg, Maryland between in the early 1980s, she claims to have met Kavanaugh at a house party in the Washington, D.C. area and says she was present when Kavanaugh and his friends, including Mark Judge, allegedly drugged girls’ drinks and participated in gang rapes.According to a sworn declaration released by Avenatti on Twitter, Swetnick alleges: ‘I first met Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh in approximately 1980-1981. I was introduced to them at a house party that I attended in the Washington D.C. area.‘Following that first introduction, I attended well over ten house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present…‘On numerous occasions at these parties, I witnessed Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking no for an answer. This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. Ryder Cup 2018: Teams, matches and schedule revealedWho is Kamala Harris?

Meghan closing her own car door before walking into the opening of \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts Royal experts are thrilled that their cast of characters is being expanded as Kate Middleton is returning to ‘work’ soon after her maternity leave - apparently those appearances at posh weddings were ‘private’ events, in case you wondered.This week the royal watchers went into overdrive, signalling that September 2018 will go down in the history books as the moment when a smiley mixed race woman finally dragged the British monarchy into the 21st century.It was accomplished with a simple- some might say humble- gesture, one that summed up (according to sycophants) her totally ‘modern’ approach to her new toff status. Yes, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, CLOSED HER OWN CAR DOOR!JANET STREET-PORTER: It may be a Rotten public image, but let’s salute King of Punk John Lydon for letting it all hang out – and sneering at the Instagram generationJANET STREET-PORTER: Rees-Mogg\u0027s nanny-botherer is a nasty piece of work but I\u0027ve still got more time for him than Serena pretending her tantrums are a political protest JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an unfortunate few minutes of television turned into a terrifying witch-hunt of one of the nicest women I knowJANET STREET-PORTER: If Harry, Meghan and Eugenie want to live it large like reality TV stars they\u0027d better have a Plan B... when the paying public has had enough JANET STREET-PORTER: Boris Johnson is a buffoon but if there\u0027s one thing we all need to agree on it\u0027s that our society is built on the absolute freedom to disagreeJANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become anti-social yobs, their parents must pay tooThe nanny-state panic over Britain’s heatwave makes my blood boil, says JANET STREET-PORTER. They know how to cope with the sun Down Under… so it’s time to send for the Aussies! JANET STREET-PORTER: If there was any evidence against Cliff he should have been tried in court, not on the BBC news by a hysterical reporter and a bunch of publicity hungry copsJANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises, two-faced Theresa and duplicitous Boris have tossed their green principles in the trashArriving at London’s Royal Academy on her first solo engagement, to open Oceania, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of the Pacific, Meghan stepped out of her limo - the door held open by a flunkey - then, turned around and closed it.Job done, she could get on with meeting a lineup of important people, delivering a short speech, and rubbing noses with a group of maori dancers and performers.Immediately, the Sun’s Royal Correspondent was congratulating the Duchess for showing she could still ‘take the time’ for these simple little tasks. Etiquette expert William Hanson offered up his take on door-gate, in case we hadn’t understood it’s importance - ‘it is usually done by others for security reasons’.I find that closing the car door is also a good idea if the weather is windy, in case it blows back on your leg, wrecking your £25 Wolford designer tights, or (worse) mows down a passing cyclist, who will start shouting obscenities.Meghan had clearly practised for this earth-shattering moment. Arriving at the launch of a charity cookbook in aid of the Grenfell survivors with her mother a few days earlier, she leapt out of the back seat and quickly shut the door.I’m sure security staff are already mulling over the implications of her impetuous actions - more of this kind of behaviour could result in staff redundancies.          The gesture generated praise for Meghan\u0027s humble attitude, but Janet Street-Porter is not convincedSadly, Meghan is not the trail-blazer we hoped - it has emerged that the Duchess of Cambridge has been shutting her own car door for some time, even whilst carrying Princess Charlotte in her arms back in 2016.Meghan might be trying to send a message that she’s the same simple girl, but as etiquette expert Mr Hanson reminds us ‘life is very different for Meghan now she’s joined The Firm -‘ no more selfies or autographs.No vote and no public social media’.Meghan says she’s a feminist who fights for women’s rights, but she signed away her chance to vote for our democracy. Maybe the chance to wear a procession of couture outfits costing thousands of pounds and live with a multi-millionaire made that bitter pill easier to swallow.          Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft, according to Janet Street-PorterAnd those four inch heels? They are not footwear women can fight in, they are unsteady and uncomfortable. A woman can wear what she chooses, but in Meghan’s position - cue the car door moment - everything she doessays and wears will be picked over.Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft. Meghan wants other women to feel comfortable and be themselves, not conform to hackneyed stereotypes, but she needs to lead by real example, not car door handle moments.She projects a very narrow, version of glamorous femininity, in complete contract to her mother, who seems much happier in her own skin and who has her own relaxed style.Fans gushed that the ‘door closing’ moment showed that Meghan was ‘humble’ and ‘down to earth’…’just like the rest of us’. According to the etiquette expert ‘she’s going to be doing things her way and helping to adapt and progress the British Monarchy’.As Private Eye would say, pass the sickbag. I find it’s easier to be modern when wearing a £2500 Givenchy dress and channelling Audrey Hepburn, although it’s not a look I plan to emulate on the London Underground any time soon.When it comes to Royal transport, Meghan is a fast learner, having made a mistake on her first public engagement with the Queen, by faffing about next to their car, and then asking Ma’am which side she fancied sitting on.Apparently the Queen ‘always sits behind the driver, although etiquette stipulates that the most senior person in a car should sit diagonally behind the chauffeur’.Just keep that pearl of wisdom in your mind, when you’re arguing about who gets the most leg room in the Uber home after a night out. And make sure you shut the door."},{"url":null,"title":"Britain enjoy final day sun 75F heat today","story":"    People paddle in the sea as they enjoy the fine autumnal weather at Lyme Regis  in Dorset this afternoon          People relax in the sun at Castle Park in Bristol today as parts of the UK enjoy temperatures above average for the time of year          Families make the most of the warm weather in Lyme Regis today as temperatures soar above the 70F mark in England          A man reads a newspaper as people enjoy the warm autumnal weather on the beach in Lyme Regis this afternoon            Scottish firefighter Scott MacLucas-Paton, 48, from the Isle of Skye in Scotland, spotted the end of this rainbow on Tuesday while climbing up Am Bhasteir mountain.

They\u0027re paying above what the NHS pays.\u0027Babylon Health offers patients ten-minute consultations – via smartphones or computers – for £25 a time. It provides these appointments free to patients who live or work in London if they de-register from their existing GP surgery and sign up with its practice in west London.A total of 32,000 patients have joined since its launch in November, including Mr Hancock, who described the service as \u0027revolutionary\u0027.The firm is planning to expand to Birmingham and Manchester over the next few months.A current job listing offers GPs a salary of £100,000 a year to work from home or £120,000 a year if they are based in the west London practice or one of four other London hubs.It promises doctors \u0027no home visits ever\u0027, \u0027no paperwork\u0027 and \u0027no never-ending duty days\u0027. This is where GPs have to remain on surgery premises to see emergency patients.Professor Stokes-Lampard is also concerned that the safety of online consultations has not been properly tested in a clinical trial – like a new drug.She will challenge Mr Hancock\u0027s endorsement of Babylon at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham next Monday.A Babylon spokesman said: \u0027The Royal College is absolutely right to highlight that practices all too often do not have enough GPs.

It will then be for the a full Senate vote to decide his fateAmong those being closely watched is Sen Jeff Flake of Arizona, a retiring Republican lawmaker who has admonished President Trump, but who failed to question Kavanaugh or Ford at Thursday\u0027s Judiciary Committee hearing – instead delivering an equivocating speech.\u0027I\u0027m sorry for what\u0027s happened to you and your family. I\u0027m sorry for what has happened to hers. This is not a good process, but it\u0027s all we\u0027ve got,\u0027 Flake said.After the hearing Flake said it was a \u0027tough call\u0027 on whether he would support Kavanaugh, saying Ford\u0027s account was \u0027compelling\u0027 but lacked \u0027corroboration from those who were there\u0027. Asked how he would vote, Flake only said \u0027let me process it\u0027. On Thursday night, Flake could be seen huddling with Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, as well as conservative Democrat Joe Manchin.                              I watched with tears as Dr Ford bravely shared her experience with the Senate,\u0027 Judge Kavanaugh, who didn\u0027t demonstrate honesty or temperament, is asking senators for a seat on the highest court in the land - which he did not deserve today.\u0027                        \u0027There have been no decisions,\u0027 Manchin reportedly said outside the hearing room. \u0027There are some concerns that people have, and we\u0027re going to try to close the loop.\u0027  While Flake is the only senator among the four who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, all are considered key to determining Kavanaugh\u0027s ultimate fate if his nomination were to reach a full vote in the Senate.They talked for around 30 minutes before a GOP conference meeting was held ahead of Friday\u0027s scheduled vote to decide whether Kavanaugh would be recommended. On Thursday night it was revealed that George W Bush had personally reached out to all four senators, hoping to help sway them to Kavanaugh\u0027s side.  Bush reportedly decided to personally reach out to the key four because of their strained relationships with Trump, according to the Washington Post. The former president has a long history with Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush during the crucial Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the US Court of Appeals in 2003.   Meanwhile, moderate Democrat Sen Doug Jones revealed on Thursday night he would be voting no on Kavanaugh\u0027s bid for the Supreme Court. The Alabama senator called the nomination process \u0027flawed from the beginning\u0027 and said he found Ford to be both credible and courageous. Jones added that he was concerned voting yes on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination would send a bad message to sons, daughters, and victims of sexual assault.   Several Senate Republicans likewise acknowledged Ford\u0027s \u0027credibility\u0027. But that didn\u0027t stop GOP leadership from scheduling a Judiciary panel meeting and Friday vote immediately after the end of Kavanaugh\u0027s testimony.If the GOP bands together on the procedural vote, the full Senate will consider the Kavanaugh nomination early next week. A   pair of Republicans failing to believe Kavanaugh\u0027s emphatic denials would doom his fate - unless a Democrat like Munchin crosses the aisle to back him.

If GOP leaders continue to rush this nomination, women \u0026amp men across the country will stand up \u0026amp fight back. The Senate failed Anita Hill \u0026amp all women in 1991. 27 years later—we must do better.\u0027   Like Murray, several Democrats found Kavanaugh\u0027s combative testimony to be disqualifying.\u0027Judge Kavanaugh exhibited temperament Americans do not want in fair judges,\u0027 said Democrat Sen Sheldon Whitehouse.           Jeff Flake is one of the senators who could stop Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination. He said he was undecided after Thursday\u0027s hearings\u0027He was discourteous, lashing out at senators raising legitimate questions, and made unfounded conspiracy allegations about imagined plots by political enemies.\u0027Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also questioned why Republicans weren\u0027t demanding the White House order the FBI to reopen their background investigation if they were \u0027so certain\u0027 of Kavanaugh\u0027s story.\u0027Hold off on a vote for several days so all the facts can come out,\u0027 he proclaimed.The American Bar Association has likewise demanded a full FBI investigation, calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee to halt the vote until one is completed. ABA President Robert Carlson wrote a letter to both Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein in which he said it was crucial that the FBI investigate Ford\u0027s claims.\u0027The basic principles that underscore the Senate\u0027s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Each appointment to our nation\u0027s Highest Court (as with all others) is simply too important to rush to a vote.\u0027 \u0027Deciding to proceed without conducting additional investigation would not only have a lasting impact on the Senate\u0027s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the Supreme Court.\u0027 Carlson\u0027s letter came just hours after Kavanaugh himself noted during his hearing that he had received the ABA\u0027s highest rating of unanimous \u0027well-qualified\u0027 for the Supreme Court before Ford\u0027s sexual assault allegations came to light.But Kavanaugh\u0027s angry denials, as well as his tearful account of the threats and harassment against his family, seemed to unite and energize Republicans.\u0027I don\u0027t know how you can listen to him and not realize that he\u0027s what he says he is,\u0027 Sen Orrin Hatch said, adding that he believes Kavanaugh will be confirmed. News of Friday\u0027s vote comes after Kavanaugh delivered a fighting end to his Senate testimony Thursday when asked directly if he was innocent of claims he tried to rape Ford or had any doubts about his integrity.\u0027100 per cent.

I still like beer. But I never drank beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted someone,\u0027 he said.He then issued a warning that attempted to tie his sexual assault allegations to the fate of any young American who enjoys beer.          Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin  exits after meeting privately with Republican Senators Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski following the hearing. The four are considered the key holdouts that could block Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination          Manchin, of West Virginia, is surrounded by reporters after meeting privately with his fellow moderate Senators. He remained silent on his thought process following the emotional day           Democratic Senators Kamala Harris questioned why Kavanaugh wasn\u0027t demanding an FBI investigation, while fellow Democrat Sen Cory Booker asked the judge if he believed Ford was a \u0027political pawn\u0027 in their tough line of questioning \u0027If every American who drank beer in high school is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault we are in a new place in this country,\u0027 he proclaimed. Whether Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking was a frequent topic of discussion during the hearing, as he continued to claim he was far too focused on his football practice to ever do such a thing on weekdays in the summer.Yet later in the hearing, Kavanaugh had to concede to  Booker  that on July 1 - a weekday - he had \u0027brewskis\u0027 with his friends after a football practice. The proof was in his much-discussed calendar. \u0027You drank on weekdays, yes or no?\u0027 Booker asked. \u0027Well, yes...on July 1,\u0027 Kavanaugh replied. Blumenthal also brought up how Kavanaugh had once described needing to \u0027piece things back together\u0027 after \u0027falling off the bus on to the front steps of the Law School at 4.45am\u0027 while he was a law student at Yale. Kavanaugh repeatedly interrupted Blumenthal, shouting \u0027I know what happened!\u0027 and then described a night of \u0027great camaraderie\u0027 at Fenway Park for a baseball game. Questions about Kavanaugh\u0027s alcohol habits became especially contentious when he was asked by Sen Amy Klobuchar if he had ever drank to the point of blacking out after she referenced her own father\u0027s struggle with alcoholism.\u0027I don\u0027t know. Have you?\u0027 he shot back in an incredible moment that was criticized by many on social media. After a brief recess, Kavanaugh apologized to Klobuchar and said: \u0027I\u0027m sorry I did that. This is a tough process.\u0027  Meanwhile, Feinstein focused her efforts on grilling Kavanaugh about the FBI\u0027s lack of involvement in investigating Ford\u0027s allegation.\u0027I\u0027ll do whatever the committee wants,\u0027 Kavanaugh responded. \u0027I wanted a hearing the day after the allegation came up! Whatever the committee decides, I\u0027m all-in immediately.\u0027            Much was made of Kavanaugh\u0027s high school yearbook (being held by Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy).

Are you afraid that they won\u0027t?\u0027Chairman Grassley interjected that Durbin didn\u0027t need Kavanaugh\u0027s permission to spring the FBI into action. \u0027If you want an FBI report, you can ask for it yourself!\u0027 he barked. Sen Kamala Harris then directly asked Kavanaugh if he would call on the White House to ask for the FBI to investigate, as his three accusers have already done.\u0027All three of the women who have made sworn allegations against you have asked for an independent FBI investigation, you\u0027ve been asked by four different members at least eight times and on national television whether you would call on the White House to authorize the FBI investigation,\u0027 she began.\u0027Are you willing to ask the White House to authorize an investigation into the claims that have been made against you?\u0027 \u0027I will do what the committee wants,\u0027 Kavanaugh said. \u0027I heard you say that,\u0027 Harris continued, not backing down. \u0027Are you willing to ask the White House to conduct an investigation by the FBI to get whatever you believe is the bottom of the allegations that have been levied against you?\u0027 When Kavanaugh once again tried to pivot from the question, Harris shot back: \u0027I don\u0027t want to debate with you\u0027. \u0027Are you willing to ask the White House to conduct such an investigation?\u0027 she repeated.          Democratic Rep Carolyn Maloney broke into tears during Ford\u0027s testimony at the Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday          Republican Sen Orrin Hatch,  a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was one of Kavanaugh\u0027s most staunch supporters following his testimony Ferocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attackWhen Kavanaugh refused yet again to directly answer the question, Harris replied: \u0027I\u0027m taking that as a no and we can move on\u0027. Kavanaugh was visibly angry when he started talking on Thursday, demanding senators to think about the facts and his willingness to testify in the wake of the allegations against him as they weigh whether or not to confirm him to the Supreme Court.Practically shouting into the microphone, Kavanaugh  blasted the Senate Judiciary Committee for waiting 10 days to let him give his side of the story, noting he denied the allegations as soon as they were made public.\u0027My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations. The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, to the Supreme Court and to the country,\u0027 he said.\u0027The day after the allegation appeared, I told this committee that I wanted a hearing as soon as possible to clear my name,\u0027 he noted. \u0027I demanded a hearing for the very next day.\u0027He slammed the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, claiming they had failed in their role in the confirmation process.\u0027This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process. But you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy,\u0027 he said.Kavanaugh also charged Democrats with a political plot to destroy him with the unwitting help of Ford. And, he alleged, it was their way of attacking  Trump and getting revenge for what happened to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\u0027This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn\u0027t take me out on the merits,\u0027 he proclaimed. \u0027When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr Ford\u0027s wishes. And then, as no doubt was expected, if not planned came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred.\u0027 Feinstein directly hit back at Kavanaugh and multiple Republican senators\u0027 claims that she had leaked Ford\u0027s story or held onto her allegations as long as possible for political gain. \u0027Let me be clear, I did not hide Dr Ford\u0027s allegations,\u0027 the senator said in a fiery defense. \u0027I did not leak her story. She asked me to hold it confidential and I did as she asked.\u0027 \u0027She was stalked by the press, she felt she was forced to come forward, and her greatest fear was realized. She\u0027s been harassed, she\u0027s had death threats, and she\u0027s had to flee her home.\u0027 Feinstein also hit back at claims that her office had not been cooperating with the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee.           Kavanaugh was visibly angry when he started talking on Thursday, demanding senators to think about the facts and his willingness to testify in the wake of the allegations against him as they weigh whether or not to confirm him          L-R: Kavanaugh\u0027s mother Martha, family friend Laura Cox Kaplan, and wife Ashley Kavanaugh, listen as Kavanaugh testifies in front of the Senate Judiciary committee regarding sexual assault allegationsFerocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attack\u0027While the majority has reached out to several people, they did not notify me or my staff that we were doing this,\u0027 she said. \u0027To argue that we were not participating, but did not tell us what they were up to is disingenuous.\u0027 \u0027I was given information by a woman who was very much afraid, who asked it be confidential, and I held it confidential until she decided she would come forward.\u0027 Feinstein also denied that her staff had leaked Ford\u0027s letter, even turning around to ask her aides right then and there in court.\u0027I\u0027m telling you I did not, I was asked to keep it confidential and I\u0027m criticized for that too,\u0027 she added.Ryan Grim, the bureau chief at The Intercept, later confirmed via tweet that it was not Feinstein\u0027s staff who leaked the letter to the publication.   During the hearing Kavanaugh vowed he would stay in the confirmation process no matter what.\u0027You may defeat me in the final vote but you\u0027ll never get me to quit – not ever,\u0027 he bodly proclaimed. \u0027I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. You have tried hard. You given it your all. No one can question your effort.\u0027Kavanaugh, who has been accused by three women of sexual assault, also vehemently denied ever committing sexual assault on anyone.\u0027I\u0027m here today to tell the truth. I have never sexually assaulted anyone – not ever,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not in high school, not in college, not ever.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not questioning that Dr Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done this to her or to anyone. That\u0027s not who I am, it is not who I was. I am innocent of this charge. I intend no ill will to Dr Ford and her family.\u0027 Kavanaugh also claimed he may have never met Ford during high school.\u0027It\u0027s possible we met at some point at some events, although I do not recall that,\u0027 he said. \u0027To repeat, all of the people identified by Dr Ford as being present at the party have said they do not remember any such party ever happening.\u0027Kavanaugh ended his opening statement with dramatic words: \u0027I swear today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and god I am innocent of this charge.\u0027           Donald McGahn, White House Council, watches as  Kavanaugh testifies on Ford\u0027s sexual assault allegationsFerocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attackExplosion: An emotional Lindsey Graham made himself an instant hero to conservatives as he attacked Democrats, accusing them of painting Brett Kavanaugh like \u0027Bill Cosby\u0027          Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump\u0027s press secretary tweeted: \u0027Lindsey Graham has more decency and courage than every Democrat on the committee combined. God bless him.\u0027He argued if Kavanaugh was the type of sexual predator as he\u0027s been charged with, he would probably still be attacking women.\u0027You\u0027re supposed to be Bill Cosby when you\u0027re a junior and senior in high school, and all of a sudden you got over it. It\u0027s been my understanding that if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school, you probably don\u0027t stop,\u0027 he said.Graham interrupted prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\u0027s questioning of Ford to requested time to speak.He then promptly used it to lash out at Kavanaugh\u0027s treatment at the hand of Democrats, saying President Donald Trump\u0027s Supreme Court nominee had been put through hell.\u0027This is not a job interview. This is hell. This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap!\u0027 he said. \u0027You have interacted with professional women all your life, not one accusation.\u0027He also charged Democrats with playing politics with Kavanaugh\u0027s career in the hopes of winning control of the Senate in the 2018 midterms and then winning the 2020 presidential election for their party.\u0027What you want to do is destroy this guy\u0027s life, hold this seat hope and hope you win in 2020. You\u0027ve said that,\u0027 he yelled.  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham angrily defended Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday in an impassioned address He also said Democrats used Ford for their own political purposes and that she was their victim - as was Kavanaugh.\u0027Boy, y\u0027all want power. Boy, I hope you never get it. I hope the American people can see through this sham, that you knew about it and you held it. You had no intention of protecting Dr. Ford, none! She\u0027s as much of a victim as you are,\u0027 he noted.He pivoted between yelling at Democrats and praising Kavanaugh, telling him he belonged on the court.\u0027When you see Sotomayor and Kagan tell them that Lindsey said hi because I voted for them,\u0027 he said referring to Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\u0027I would never do to them what you\u0027ve done to this guy! This is the most unethical sham since I\u0027ve been in politics, and if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn\u0027t have done what you have done to this guy,\u0027 he said, returning to release his ire on Democrats.Ferocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attackGraham also apologized to Kavanaugh, saying the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing wasn\u0027t the place for a fair process.\u0027God, I hate to say it because these have been my friends, but let me tell you when it comes to this. You\u0027re looking for a fair process. You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend,\u0027 he said.Graham concluded his remarks with a plea to his colleagues to confirm Kavanaugh and get in a few final shots at Democrats.\u0027To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you\u0027re legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics. You want this seat. I hope you never get it. I hope you\u0027re on the Supreme Court. That\u0027s exactly where you should be. And I hope that the American people will see through this charade. And I wish you well. And I intend to vote for you and I hope everybody who is fair-minded will,\u0027 he concluded.Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was up next for questions, offered a bit of light heartedness.\u0027Should we let things settle a little bit after that,\u0027 he said.                        The nominee had arrived for the make-or-break evidence session hand-in-hand with his wife Ashley after hours of testimony from Ford, the woman who says he tried to rape her when she was 15.Neither smiled as they walked into the Senate committee room for his testimony after Ford was called \u0027credible\u0027 and thanked for her testimony by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who was brought in to avoid the appearance of a group of older men questioning an alleged sexual assault survivor.In emotional testimony, Ford, 51, came close to tears as she repeatedly said that she knew Kavanaugh was the man who tried to rape her.\u0027No and I would like to reiterate again that I was trying to get the information to you while there looked to be a list of other credible qualified candidates,\u0027 she told senators when asked to clarify if she came forward for political reasons.Ford ended almost three hours of testimony with even Republican senators saying her testimony was credible. \u0027I found no reason to find her not credible,\u0027 GOP Senator John Cornyn said. Ford said earlier in her testimony that she wanted to get information about her allegation to the White House before  Trump formally nominated Kavanaugh to the high court - but had been unsure how to proceed.      Ford looked frustrated and appeared to be struggling to keep her composure as she explained it was \u0027absolutely not\u0027 possible she mistook another teenage attacker for Kavanaugh           Questioning began with sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell (pictured) acknowledging that Ford was \u0027terrified\u0027Ferocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attack\u0027So he administered a polygraph on the day that you attended your grandmother\u0027s funeral?,\u0027 Mitchell asked.\u0027Correct,\u0027 Ford replied. \u0027It might have been the next day. I spent the night in the hotel.\u0027Ford said her primary memory of taking the test was \u0027crying a lot.\u0027  Asked why she took it, Ford said: \u0027I didn\u0027t see any reason not to do it. I found it extremely stressful. Much longer than I anticipated. I told my whole life story, I felt like. I endured it. It was fine.\u0027 In one of the more emotional moments of the morning, Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy asked Ford what stuck out to her in her memory.\u0027Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,\u0027 Ford said, her voice breaking up. \u0027The laughter, the upraised laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.\u0027\u0027You never forgot that laughter?,\u0027 Leahy asked as Ford nodded and one of her lawyers patted her back for reassurance.\u0027I was under one of them while they laughed. Two friends having fun together,\u0027 Ford said. At several moments throughout her time before the panel of 21 senators, Ford grew emotional, fighting back tears and struggling to keep her composure. Ford was also almost in tears at another point in the questioning when Blumenthal praised her courage.Blumenthal quoted from the 2015 book My Story from Sen Graham, who sat a few seats down from him on the judiciary panel, in his praise from Ford.The senator noted Graham wrote that it takes \u0027courage from a deep and hidden place for a rape victim or sexually abused child to testify against their assailant\u0027 as Ford held back tears.Ford\u0027s morning began with her own testimony where, over deep, shaky breathing, she said Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had been \u0027extremely inebriated\u0027 on a summer night in 1982.          Later in the hearing, Kavanaugh had to concede to Sen Cory Booker that on July 1 - a weekday - he had \u0027brewskis\u0027 with his friends after a football practice, despite claiming he never drank on weekdays. The proof was in his calendar          Ford revealed that she had first mentioned her allegations to her husband during a major renovation of their home in Palo Alto, California (pictured). Ford said that she had wanted two front doors as a result of the anxiety and nervousness she had been left with as a result of the alleged attack        Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor from Arizona, quizzed Christine Ford on Thursady but didn\u0027t land a punch shortly after Brett Kavanaugh took his place at the witness table, committee Republicans took over the questioning themselvesFerocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attackWhile a line of Democrats drew a stream of emotional memories out of Christine Ford, Mitchell drew consistent sneers from Kavanaugh partisans for her dry questions and seemingly pointless digressions.Ultimately Mitchell thanked Ford for taking part in the exercise and shook her hand – ending the session more colleague than adversary after never once directly challenging her recollection of being groped and pinned to a bed at a high school party in 1982.Mitchell came back for a few 5-minute rounds of Q-and-A with Kavanaugh, but her day was quickly ended. The president fielded phone calls in the White House reisdence from outside allies while watching the hearing, a White House official told DailyMail.com, and most of the calls left him feeling pessimistic.\u0027The consensus wasn\u0027t good,\u0027 the official said. Ford, observed Fox News Channel legal expert Andrew Napolitano, \u0027is extremely credible and Rahel Mitchell is not laying a glove on her.\u0027            With president Trump watching, Fox News Channel host Chris Wallace pronounced Mitchell\u0027s portion of the hearing a disaster for Republicans            Fox legal expert Andrew Napolitano (top right) also slammed Republicans for letting Mitchell have control of the hearingDonald Trump has praised Napolitano for his on-screen analysis in the past. With Trump almost certainly watching, the former judge said: \u0027The president cannot be happy with this.\u0027What Trump saw on his White House television was a dais of his Republican allies sitting silently and not defending Kavanaugh while Mitchell carried on a superficial line of questioning.\u0027Fox News Sunday\u0027 host Chris Wallace, too, gave Mitchell a thumbs-down during a break in the hearing.\u0027This is a disaster for the Republicans,\u0027 Wallace said. \u0027She is treating this like a deposition, like a court hearing.\u0027Unlike in a courtroom, Mitchell was not permitted to grill Ford at length. Instead she had disjointed five-minute segments, the slices of time alloted to her by Republicans who chose not to interrogate her themselves.That kept her from building momentum and gave Ford consistent intermissions to soak in praise from Democrats who invited her to describe her decades of psychological pain.            Mitchell shook Ford\u0027s hand after questioning her in a forum that allowed her no chance to build momentumOne rare positive for Mitchell came when she established that Ford chose to fly to Hawaii, Costa Rica and French Polynesia on vacations.Republicans on the Judiciary Committee had postponed a hearing last week because Ford said one effect of her sexual-assault trauma was a fear of flying.But most of the prosecutor\u0027s work consisted of finding minor inconsistencies in Ford\u0027s story.She focused on Ford\u0027s description testimony about the distance between home adolescent home and the house that hosted the party, and her lack of a driver\u0027s license at the time.The veiled suggestion was that whoever drove her home after her alleged sexual assault might not remember events the way Ford does.But with only intermittent chances to swing daintily at her, Mitchell never drew blood.In her last five-minute back-and-forth, Mitchell seemed to complain about how the hearing\u0027s format put her at a disadvantage.Ferocious blaze engulfs lorry on the M40 causing travel chaosDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusLaura Kuenssberg questions Corbyn on Labour\u0027s Brexit testsSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushShocking moment brawl erupts in Fir Vale School in SheffieldTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanPolice forced to intervene after \u0027riot\u0027 breaks out at a schoolSeven arrested on suspicion of planning Netherlands terror attackTalking about the standard practices for people who interview trauma survivors, she said that no stufy whose \u0027that this setting, in five-minute increments, is the best way to do that.\u0027Instead she recommended having \u0027a trained interviewer talk to you one-on-one in a private setting, and to let you do the talking\u0027 at greater length.\u0027That makes a lot of sense,\u0027 Ford replied.Mitchell noted that Ford had turned down such an interview proposed near her California home.Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill agreed that Mitchell was likely doomed from the start, but said she would have little chance of tripping Ford up no matter the format.\u0027She has a tough job,\u0027 McCaskill told reporters during a hearing recess. \u0027I can’t imagine doing either a direct examination or a cross examination in five minute increments.\u0027\u0027And,\u0027 the Missouri Democrat added, Mitchell is \u0027not used to cross examining people who tell the truth.\u0027                        Her voice quavered as she described her trauma following the house party where she claims Kavanaugh attacked her as Judge watched.\u0027I don\u0027t have all the answers, and I don\u0027t remember as much as I would like to,\u0027 she said. \u0027But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.\u0027 \u0027When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn\u0027t see who pushed me.\u0027\u0027I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027This was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.\u0027She added: \u0027Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time.\u0027 Ford also addressed questions in her opening statement about why she did not report the assault at the time.\u0027For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details.

I want to thank all the people who are working so tirelessly on this case.\u0027But withing a minute it was gone. The Ministry of Defence said Mr Williamson\u0027s social media profile was personal and it did not know why the tweet was deleted. Scotland Yard declined to comment.                                                     \u0027But this is not true. This army unit at that time was based in Ussuriysk – 670 km away from Khabarovsk\u0027, he said.He was also reported to have attended the Military-Diplomatic Academy of Defence Ministry known in the secret services as the \u0027music academy\u0027.Here, it is claimed, he got his second identity as Boshirov.\u0027Next time Chepiga\u0027s name comes out in December 2014 when he got his Hero of Russia award for performing some peacekeeping mission,\u0027 said KP.\u0027According to the researchers, the 14th brigade - where Chepiga was still listed for some reason - was spotted near Ukrainian border at the end of 2014.\u0027 The Kremlin was branded shameful last night for claiming Chepiga and his unknown accomplice, who used the alias Alexander Petrov, were holidaymakers. Boris Johnson tweeted: \u0027Utterly predictable news that GRU is behind Skripal atrocity.\u0027 The former foreign secretary added: \u0027What have you got to say, Putin?\u0027The two Russian agents were charged over the poisonings by the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this month. But they later appeared on Russian TV to insist they were visiting Salisbury for its cathedral.As the bungled attack that left one dead and three seriously ill took another twist: It emerged that Chepiga fought for a feared Spetsnaz unit for 17 years and worked undercover for at least nine.    This undated image is alleged to show Chepiga (circled) posing with fellow members of the Russian military  The dark star of Russia\u0027s elite special forces school: Colonel who signed up at 18, was honoured at gaudy memorial to military and then sent to kill Skripal The highly-decorated spy blamed for the Salisbury poisonings was a veteran of Russia\u0027s elite special forces and had trained at one of the country\u0027s top military academies, it emerged last night.The man behind the alias of Boshirov was unmasked by the investigative website as Colonel Chepiga - a GRU intelligence officer bestowed with Russia\u0027s highest state award.His military career began at the age of 18 when he enrolled in a top military school just 25 miles from his tiny home village of Nikolaevka, near the Russia-China border.Col Chepiga studied at the Far Eastern Military Command Academy in Blagoveschensk, an elite training ground for \u0027Spetsnaz\u0027 special forces officers.His name features on a memorial wall at the school under the Gold Star honour list. After graduating from the school with honours in 2001, he was assigned to Russia\u0027s 14th Spetsnaz Brigade, based in the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk.  Dawn Sturgess (left) died after spraying Novichok on her wrists thinking it was a perfume. Her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, (right) fell critically ill but recoveredSpetsnaz units are responsible for highly-secretive missions and are equivalent to the British SAS.Under the command of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence agency, his brigade played a vital role in the second Chechen war and was also spotted near the Ukrainian border in late 2014.The information was revealed by investigative website Bellingcat, which had conducted a painstaking investigation into his background.It said that his unit had deployed three times to Chechnya, where Russia was carrying out what it called a \u0027counter-terrorist operation\u0027.The website of a state-run military volunteer organisation claims that Col Chepiga received more than 20 military awards and decorations in the course of his service.And his former military school proudly boasts on its website that he was bestowed his homeland\u0027s highest honour, Hero of the Russian Federation, in 2014. The award is often presented by Vladimir Putin himself.  This map shows the progress of the spies\u0027 assassination plot, as police managed to piece together using CCTV               The two men chose a hotel in east London, 127 miles from Salisbury, despite heading to the city twice in three daysWhile the achievements of his fellow award-winners are detailed extensively, Col Chepiga\u0027s simply says it was awarded \u0027by decree from the Russian president\u0027. Bellingcat speculated that he could have been given the award for operations in Eastern Ukraine – where Russia\u0027s military was secretly operating in 2014.Senior Russian military officials have since said that so-called \u0027little green men\u0027 – soldiers wearing uniforms with no insignia – were in fact members of Russia\u0027s Spetsnaz deployed secretly to Ukraine. The Bellingcat website also found an undated photograph of graduates from the Far Eastern Military Command Academy on assignment in Chechnya.It pointed out that the man on the far right looks strikingly similar to the man named as Boshirov by the Metropolitan Police – although it said it could not prove conclusively it was the same person.They came across the photograph after sources said the school was a likely place for a Russian military officer with a specialism in Western European operations to have trained.

Both were critically ill after the Novichok attack in SalisburyAfter further digging, they came across the mysterious Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. Address databases link him to the Military Unit 20662 – code for the 14th Spetsnaz Brigade.The logo of the brigade is a black bat with a yellow parachute behind it. It was formed in the 1960s and has been under the command of the GRU for much of its history. According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 – tough but unsophisticated.Once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to join foreign agencies are punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning. The GRU has become adept as using so-called \u0027non-linear warfare\u0027, which uses a combination of covert special forces operations, spying, cyber attacks and internet trolls to destabilise enemy nations.It started as an intelligence-gathering agency for Trotsky\u0027s Bolshevik Red Army, and Lenin insisted it remain separate from the other intelligence organisations.Today it still sits apart from the SVR, the external spying service, and the domestic FSB (the equivalents of Britain\u0027s MI6 and MI5), which were created when the notorious KGB was split in 1991.  How will the West react to proof Putin lied?Commentary by Owen Matthews THIS sensational revelation – the seniority of the would-be assassin and the official state support for the mission – shows that the Skripal hit must have been ordered at the very highest levels of the Russian state.The evidence that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attack grows stronger every day.Indeed, by presiding over one of the most farcically inept cover-ups in memory – when the two Russians caught on CCTV here claimed to have been tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral – Putin has condemned himself out of his own mouth.Days after British police released dozens of security camera images of the pair on their way from Moscow to Salisbury, Putin appeared on Russian television to defend them as \u0027innocent Russian citizens about whom we know nothing\u0027. His fingerprints were all over the operation.The following afternoon, \u0027Petrov\u0027 and \u0027Boshirov\u0027 themselves appeared to air a cock-and-bull story about being turned back from their mission to see Salisbury by slush – two days in a row.          Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the two suspects were just civilians and not members of the GRUBefore the denials by Putin and by the suspects themselves, it might have been possible to argue plausibly that the botched assassination attempt was some kind of rogue operation by Russia\u0027s secret services.But Putin\u0027s personal defence of the suspects and the inept cover-up job by the state-controlled media constitute strong, if wholly unintended, proof of the Kremlin\u0027s deep complicity.And now the Bellingcat revelations have added incontrovertible layers of detail to the emerging picture of a top-level GRU assassination squad operating on UK soil.Using mostly open-source data, Bellingcat\u0027s researchers first unearthed details of the passports the suspects used to enter the UK, published by British police.Petrov and Boshirov\u0027s passport numbers, it turned out, varied by just a single digit – and were issued by a Moscow office used exclusively for officials\u0027 travel documents. Even more suspiciously, Boshirov\u0027s passport file was stamped \u0027Do not reveal information\u0027.Then, yesterday, came the clincher. By trawling through the records of GRU academy graduation classes, Bellingcat matched the photos of \u0027Boshirov\u0027 to the real-life Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga. Once they had a name, details of Colonel Chepiga\u0027s secret service popped up all over the internet, in online posts by veterans\u0027 groups and even written in letters of gold on a stone monument to the decorated graduates of one of the GRU\u0027s secret intelligence academies.Chepiga served in Chechnya with the Spetznaz, the elite forces of the Federal Security Service, where by some reports he received 20 awards and decorations.In short, Putin has been caught out telling analogue lies in a digital world.          Counter-terrorism police released images of two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack and named them as Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov (circled right)Bellingcat became famous for its painstaking investigation into the downing of a Malaysian Airlines Boeing over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014, collecting photos from social media and intelligence data showing the hour-by-hour progress of the Buk missile system which downed the plane, from a military base inside Russia into Eastern Ukraine and back again.Russia\u0027s vehement denials of involvement were shown to be false. Now, with Bellingcat\u0027s dozens of detailed revelations about the true identity of one of the would-be Skripal assassins, another of the Kremlin\u0027s brazen lies has been carefully picked apart.Perhaps the most terrifying part of the whole tragic story of the Skripal poisoning, which resulted in the death of an innocent British bystander, is the shocking combination of the Kremlin\u0027s deadly intent and utter incompetence.Instead of quietly disposing of a \u0027traitor\u0027, Chepiga and his as-yet-unnamed accomplice succeeded in contaminating parts of Salisbury, murdering an innocent woman, and revealing themselves to the whole world as bungling idiots.Attempting extra-judicial execution on British soil is bad enough. But to spread deadly nerve agent around a cathedral city is irresponsible bungling on an epic scale.The question now, of course, is what the response of the West will be to this damning revelation.Will Theresa May call for renewed sanctions? Will America ratchet up their rhetoric? We shall have to wait and see in the coming days.What is clear is that the Kremlin and its henchmen have been revealed for what they are – not just a bunch murderous liars, but terrible at both.bellingcat - Skripal Suspect Boshirov Identified as GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga - bellingcat"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef8c473a67cbf2709d8b0e34d0072345e0b246a/9_6_2574_1544/master/2574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf717178d795c84f09d56072ec715226","title":"vincent van gogh starry night hokusai great wave","story":"Writer says Dutch painter was influenced by Japanese print he is known to have admiredOne of the great masterpieces of 19th-century western art was loosely inspired by one of the greats of 19th-century Japanese art, it has been argued.Martin Bailey, a specialist on Vincent van Gogh, believes that the Dutch artist drew inspiration from Katsushika Hokusai’s The Great Wave off Kanagawa when he painted one of his most dazzling and celebrated works, The Starry Night.Side by side, the similarities are obvious. In the Hokusai the wave towers over the volcanic peak of Mount Fuji, Bailey said. In the Van Gogh, “the swirling mass in the sky hurtles towards the more gentle slopes of Les Alpilles”.Art historians know that Van Gogh was a keen collector of Japanese prints. He particularly admired the Hokusai print, which is now one of the most recognisable and reproduced artworks of all time. In one letter to his brother Theo, he said: the “These waves are claws, the boat is caught in them, you can feel it.”Starry Night was painted in the summer of 1889, when Van Gogh was in a small mental asylum on the outskirts of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.He was a voluntary patient, admitted after he cut off his ear and presented it, wrapped in paper, to a young woman in a local brothel.Van Gogh was well aware that he could not live independently without help. “It must have been horrific moving into a mental asylum in the 19th century,” said Bailey, author of the recent published Starry Night: Van Gogh at the Asylum. “I did research on the other patients in the asylum and they were all in a terrible state so it must have been very, very difficult for him to adjust his life. I think it was art which kept him sane and gave him a reason to live.”He painted Starry Night in June, inspired by the the night sky he looked up at through the bars of his cell and the stunning Provence landscape with wheat fields, cypress trees and olive groves.Bailey argues that Van Gogh was also inspired, possibly unconsciously, by his memories of The Great Wave. “He didn’t have the print with him but he obviously remembered it in great detail. He had a very strong visual memory.”The comparison should not be seen as diminishing the brilliance of Starry Night, Bailey said. The painting was “a work of imagination with all sorts of conscious and unconscious elements which must have come in to Vincent’s mind when he was doing the painting”.But the similarities between the thrust of the wave and the swirling of the sky that they are both striking studies in blue and the fact that Van Gogh admired The Great Wave so much all point to a loose inspiration, said Bailey, who blogs about Van Gogh for the Art Newspaper and will discuss his book and theory at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on 5 October. “It is surprising no one has made this comparison before. I’ve put it to a number of Hokusai and Van Gogh experts and they have all said it is a very interesting theory. It is difficult to prove but my feeling is that it is highly likely.”Starry Night is regarded as one of Van Gogh’s masterpieces although the artist himself never regarded it that way.“I love it and it is fascinating when you think of where it was created, this marvellous and optimistic picture created in the most difficult and challenging of circumstances. Who would imagine someone living in a mental asylum would be able to paint such a marvellous work?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9ad419a4016fd0dcdee7a6dc7ed766e702d832/0_0_2362_1890/master/2362.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b4e67f58cadca15cc9d3ffc141194ea9 1320w","title":"paul trevor ping pong portraitist in pictures","story":"Using the fast-moving skills he honed as a table tennis champ, Paul Trevor wandered through London’s financial district and a market in Brick Lane, taking spontaneous closeups.

The novel centres on Charlie, a man “drifting through life and dodging full-time employment”, who has fallen in love with Miranda, a student with a secret.When Charlie buys a “synthetic human” called Adam and teams up with Miranda to design Adam’s personality, the couple creates what publisher Jonathan Cape called a “beautiful, strong and clever … near-perfect human”. But when a love triangle forms, the three face a “profound moral dilemma”.According to the publisher, the novel confronts fundamental questions, from what makes us human to whether a machine can understand the human heart. Dan Franklin, who acquired the new book, said it was “totally compulsive … in pure storytelling terms … funny, sorrowful and intensely engaging”. A mix of mystery, love story, and “one of the most morally layered books McEwan has written”, Franklin dubbed Machines Like Me is “the crucial novel for our times”.Machines Like Me is not McEwan’s first venture into speculative fiction. His 1987 novel The Child in Time was set in a near future on the edge of nuclear war, with a neo-Thatcherite government pledging to “to keep order, and to defend the state against its enemies”. His 2001 novel Atonement was originally a science-fiction story set “two or three centuries in the future”, according to an interview McEwan gave to the Harry Ransom Center in Texas after selling his archive there for $2m (£1.5m) in 2014.“The writer tends to forget rapidly the routes he or she discarded along the way,” he said at the time. “Sometimes the path towards a finished novel takes surprising twists.”McEwan’s last novel was 2017’s Nutshell, a modern retelling of Hamlet from the perspective of a foetus. His most recent work has been adapting his books for film, having written the screenplays for recent films of The Children Act and On Chesil Beach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e594a92cff859245c9b5651bd7395c8a6e4a3897/0_184_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc4a3e084963c5b9f98e3a940ced5e61","title":"brett kavanaugh credibility devastating hearing","story":"The US supreme court nominee has badly stumbled just as he believed he was striding towards the highest court in the landThey say there are no heroes and no leaders left in Washington. Well one showed up in front of the Senate judiciary committee, and her name is Dr Christine Blasey Ford.Victims are supposed to be many things: suffering creatures who struggle to withstand the klieg lights of a court, or a hearing. Ford was something else entirely.Her pain was clear each time her voice cracked and her eyes welled with tears. But her courage, decency and honesty were even clearer as she walked carefully over ground she plainly never wanted to revisit from her teenage years.When Democratic senators were trying to score political points, she stuck to the facts as she remembered them, and the science behind why those memories are so vivid. When the Republican prosecutor was trying to poke holes in her credibility and memory, she offered her honest help in patiently answering an endless line of small-bore questions.The contrast with the US supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, could not have been greater. He was hot and bothered from the outset, fiddling with his shirt cuffs, sniffing incessantly, anxiously unscrewing small bottles of water, spraying accusations across the political landscape.He lapsed into his old role as a political hack, accusing a wide range of actors for his suffering: the media, the Democrats on the judiciary committee, a vast leftwing conspiracy, the Clintons. He predicted political Armageddon as sex was weaponized to destroy reputations, notably his own, as he was just on the verge of success.“For decades to come I fear the country will reap the whirlwind,” he declared. “When I did at least OK enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.”As a federal appeals court judge, Kavanaugh’s performance was jarringly unbalanced and at times unhinged.As a former staffer to Ken Starr, the man who investigated Bill Clinton’s sexual scandals in excruciating and public detail, Kavanaugh seemed oblivious to his part in the very whirlwind that swept him up.Republicans had two ways to defend Kavanaugh. One boiled down to mistaken identity: Ford was assaulted, but she couldn’t be sure by who. The other revolved around arcane process questions about committee letters and staffers, senators and protocol. The extended debate about process made the Republican chairman Chuck Grassley sound like the grumpy, batty octogenarian he really is.But the questions about mistaken identity prompted two answers that were as explosive as they were definitive.Ford was asked about her strongest memory of the assault. The response was deeply moving to anyone with a living, beating heart. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter, and their having fun at my expense,” Ford said, as she turned her eyes down to her lap. “I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another.”Another senator asked Ford what was her degree of certainty about being assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh.In the silence that followed, you could hear Republicans gasping for air as they calculated the political cost of this nomination. What was larger? The number of votes they were losing among women versus the number of votes they would lose among Trump fanatics by putting this flatlining nomination out of its misery.Senate hearings are political theater: a strange spectacle with legal trappings designed to showcase the leading actors, the senators themselves. So it was doubly strange to see one half of the actors step off stage and surrender their time to a career prosecutor.They wanted to avoid the scene of a group of men badgering a woman about sexual assault. Sure enough, they managed to avoid looking like they were staging a witch trial. But by choosing silence they looked worse: like cowards.While Democratic senators could express sympathy for Ford and the searing memories of her sexual assault, their Republican counterparts gave their time to a technical deposition. The questions by Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, were cold and calculating.At best the questions were tone deaf. At worst they were uncaring and self-defeating. Far from undermining the credibility of Ford, the prosecutor made the professor look more credible, more human, and more sympathetic.The same could not be said for the prosecutor’s questions of Kavanaugh. The more he was grilled about sex and alcohol, the worse he sounded. Did he drink to the point where he blacked out, or woke up in a different place, or found his clothes somewhere else? The questions themselves were tarnishing Kavanaugh even as they were intended to clear him.“We drank beer. And sometimes we probably had too many beers,” Kavanaugh said, clinging to the only talking point that made him seem comfortable. “We drank beer. We liked beer.”Did he drink too many beers?“What are too many beers? I don’t know,” he said, seeming totally unprepared to talk about his favorite subject. “Whatever the chart says. The blood alcohol chart.”The Republican senators soon abandoned the prosecutor and her pesky questions about penis-waving and gang rape, resorting instead to angry finger-wagging and complaints about the Democrats.Aside from his impassioned denials, Kavanaugh’s defense hinged on one claim: that Ford’s friend, Leland Ingham Keyser, didn’t recall the party or Kavanaugh. The judge claimed that meant Ford’s accusations were not just uncorroborated but refuted. But they weren’t refuted, and Keyser also said she believed her friend.In any case, the judge himself undermined Keyser’s blanket amnesia when he said that actually he knew her, probably at high school.It was a pattern repeated throughout Kavanaugh’s many angry outbursts and interruptions. He claimed he had no calendar record of the party in question, so it didn’t take place. He even claimed he never attended any gathering of that kind.But he also said he liked hanging out with his friends, drinking beers and talking about girls. Which sounded remarkably like the night Ford described.For a guy who claimed to have busted his butt on his academics, it wasn’t clear that Kavanaugh busted his butt preparing for a hearing that will define his career and reputation. He had no coherent response for why he couldn’t support an FBI investigation into Ford’s account.When asked what he personally thought about an investigation, Kavanaugh sat in silence before blurting out something about the FBI not coming to conclusions.Instead, Kavanaugh interrupted Democratic senators to press them on whether they liked to drink, and what they liked to drink. He teared up at strange moments, about his yearbook, his calendars and his workouts with his football buddies.The longer the questioning went on, the more he interrupted, the more evasive he sounded. He claimed his yearbook references to throwing up was just because of his weak stomach. It could have been spicy food, or could have been beer. Either way, he really loved beer and still does.Kavanaugh’s nomination may, or may not, survive the Senate hearing on Thursday. But his credibility, testifying under oath for a lifetime job on the highest court in the land, did not.Brett Kavanaugh’s former boss might have put it best. “You cannot defile the temple of justice,” Ken Starr intoned to reporters as he was carrying out the trash from his home.That was back in the late 1990s, when Kavanaugh was, um, defiling the temple of justice by leaking confidential tidbits to those same reporters on behalf of Starr.Two decades later, he and his Republican senator friends were shocked (shocked!) that confidential tidbits were getting leaked to reporters. The media was outrageously misreading his yearbook to concoct references to sex and beer. It was a sham, a con, that couldn’t possibly be subject to an FBI investigation because the Democrats were so political.Nobody should suffer the public whirlwind that has swept up two families, the Fords and the Kavanaughs. No senators should bluster and rage when considering a supreme court nominee.But more than anyone else in Washington, Brett Kavanaugh should know that he stumbled badly just as he believed he was striding towards his rightful place on the supreme court. You cannot defile the temple of justice when you want your own seat in the inner sanctum of the high temple itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b988da59658074134c07e00c0567d50fd8b25e6/6_406_5426_3257/master/5426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d9acad019cdb1df7e9b3deebd2079c","title":"the guardian view on big data and insurance knowing too much","story":"Is it reasonable for life insurance companies to demand that their customers try to get fit? Reasonable or not, it is already happening. John Hancock, one of the oldest life insurance companies in the US, announced last week that it would in future only write policies that offer rewards for customers who use various forms of fitness trackers or join gyms. Similar offers are available in Britain, where 1.1 million people have signed up to such schemes. It is entirely sensible that people who take out health insurance should also try to become healthier. But if the process is carried to extremes, it could undermine one of the fundamental principles of any insurance market.Insurance works because we are ignorant of our inidual fates. It is the fact that any of us might turn out to be a bad risk that makes it sensible for everyone to insure against that remote chance. The pooling of inidual risks that can only be known in aggregate underlies the whole system. But there is a subtle mismatch of aims between insurers and their customers. The customers want to avoid the consequences of misfortune the insurers want customers who avoid misfortune. The two aims are reconciled because both sides are operating behind a veil of ignorance.Insurers have an interest in knowing as much as possible about their customers. Customers have an interest in insurers underestimating their real risk. But there is a further complication. Each inidual customer also has an interest in the insurers pricing all the others accurately, with the help of as much information as possible. And both sides will benefit if ways are found to reduce the risk of the misfortune insured against. Fireproofing houses is good for both sides of the home insurance business. Giving up smoking is good for both sides of the life insurance business. The balance between knowledge and ignorance of risk has traditionally been struck at the level of statistical knowledge about large groups. Take motor insurance: women used to get cheaper car insurance because they crash less and drive better than men. Young drivers pay far more than old ones, for the same kind of reasons.But statistically significant groups are getting smaller in the age of big data. In the US, one data company uses 442 non-medical attributes to predict medical costs and so which clients are profitable to insure. In the light of the health disparities between the rich and poor areas of Britain, private insurers could do the same here with no more information than a postcode. This is why the NHS has to cover everyone, if it is to work as it should. The risks must be shared between healthy and unhealthy, rich and poor. No one must be left out of the pool. Offering rewards for healthy behaviour benefits all of society. But penalising unhealthy behaviour with worse or less insurance injures those who really need protection. Given the correlation between unhealthy lifestyles and lower incomes, the risks are only too clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a125563698b776c1bd884361da8ffc3a0edb4344/0_425_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab25dad599dc307bb40c78085d58efd8","title":"thousands women striking solidarity glasgow pay","story":"Blink and you might have missed it, but last week in Glasgow women made history. Bringing to a head a decade-long dispute between thousands of low-paid carers, cleaners and caterers with Glasgow city council, Unison and GMB members voted in landslide numbers to strike over historic equal pay claims estimated to be worth up to £1bn. If no other arrangement is reached, working-class women will soon bring Scotland’s biggest city grinding to a halt as they withdraw the labour that is so often invisible and yet vital to the functioning of any society.In the age of #MeToo and an unprecedented public interest in the gender pay gap and equal pay at organisations such as the BBC, these women should now be taking their rightful place on the fronts of newspapers and at the tops of bulletins, with feminists and socialists everywhere lining up behind them in solidarity. Instead their activism has largely gone under the radar, framed as a local or party political issue, or not really acknowledged at all. Not all forms of feminist or trade union action are created equal, it seems.Trade unions have fought in recent years to shrug off an image of gruff blokeiness, just as black, LGBT and working-class women have advocated for a feminism that is intersectional and inclusive. Both have made great strides, but Glasgow’s equal pay women serve as an example of how far we still have to go. Compared with the rightfully extensive coverage of Birmingham’s refuse strikers or Hollywood’s abuse scandal, is it that they are too female to be a proper workers’ rights story, and too working class to be a proper feminist one?Inherent in the dismissal of Glasgow’s equal pay women is an assumption that the domestic work of cleaning, care and catering should naturally fall to women, preferably those who’ll get on with it quietly and be grateful that they’re getting paid at all.When Glasgow city council responded to strike ballot results by claiming that “putting vulnerable people at risk by calling a strike … cannot be justified”, they failed to acknowledge that these women have propped up Glasgow’s economy for decades precisely by caring for vulnerable people – not to mention that many have their own families who also live in precarity, owing in large part to the undervaluing of their work. An eagerness to interpret the dispute as the political manoeuvring of union bosses has similarly ignored the ability of these women to self-organise and act in interests beyond those of political pawns.Some of the women involved in this dispute have been fighting since 2007, and many are nearing retirement. Their equal-pay battle began with a national pay scheme that jumped through hoops to combine different criteria and conditions just to maintain the unequal status quo. But on top of this, the outsourcing of their work to arm’s-length companies has seen many landed with increased workloads, faster turnaround times for home carers, meagre sick pay and conditions that mean they receive payouts of just a few months of salary upon leaving work, many having never earned enough to build up a pension.All of this is set against a backdrop of decades of physically demanding and often emotionally draining work that ultimately forces many into early retirement anyway. Theirs is a story of the many ways in which class and gender intersect with austerity, privatisation and other capitalist forces to keep working-class women busy and quiet. But now Glasgow’s women have found their voice.If society really does find itself on a post-#MeToo precipice, then we have a decision to make: take the path of least resistance and focus on representation and CEOs, or fight for a feminism that goes beyond the boardroom, and a politics of workers’ rights that accounts for the specific ways in which women are oppressed by low-paid and precarious work.Glasgow’s cleaners, cooks and carers have made their choice. Over the coming months the city could see thousands of working-class women on picket lines, demanding what they’re owed after decades of being downtrodden. Our solidarity is the least that they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717cc37cdf9a92ae4ca38672cec4505341633834/0_0_3334_2001/master/3334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=464a0147a54b30de64a05f092482dbd0","title":"cher dancing queen review ingenious abba dabbling","story":"As Cher proved in her Mamma Mia: Her We Go Again! cameo, she need do very little to provoke squealing acclaim when it comes to Abba dabbling: merely descend from a helicopter in stately fashion and sing Fernando in that thrillingly ripe tone. But Dancing Queen, an album of Abba covers that could easily have sailed by like glitter on the breeze, is often surprisingly ingenious.Occasionally Cher uses her trademark Auto-Tune like a crutch – it’s a cop-out on One of Us – but mostly it acts as a kind of interstellar portal that elevates Abba from the dancefloor to the cosmos. “No one can hear my praaaaayer,” she belts on Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!, voice melting into vocoder and amplifying the song’s existential loneliness. Shivering trance synths threaten to overwhelm The Winner Takes It All, lending a sense of deathly transcendence to Abba’s valedictory hit. This blur between human and cyborg, where sequins become holograms, is a thrillingly clever distillation of pop immortality.Not that anyone’s coming to Dancing Queen for a pop thesis on transhumanism. The boozy, jostling arrangements of Waterloo and a breathless Mamma Mia spark like polyester-clad crotches grinding together. And her piercing rendition of Dancing Queen is quite unsettling, her miraculous voice – capable of conveying vulnerability, vengeance and pain all at once – is the perfect weapon to re-wreak Abba’s emotional devastation. “If I said I cared for you,” she sings beautifully on The Name of the Game, “would you feel the same way too?” A thousand times, yes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd096bd1c1282eb7e7139deda82483824fb0acc/0_54_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e00c6567ca17d7dc0e264700f46b60","title":"top schools call for an end to universities use of unconditional offers","story":"Heads claim they encourage A-level students to ‘take their foot off the gas’Elite private schools have called for universities to cut back on the use of unconditional offers for undergraduate places over fears that pupils will not be motivated to strive for high A-level grades.Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country’s most expensive independent schools, claimed that pupils “take their foot off the gas” after accepting offers that do not require specific A-level grades.“These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,” Buchanan, the former headteacher of Ashford School in Kent, told the Times newspaper.“I am asking universities to stop using them unless they have interviewed the pupil and got some sense that it would be good for this pupil, or have consulted the school, which has given you the same information.”Until recently only a small number of school-leavers were given unconditional offers. But the government’s removal of its cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities in England to expand and aggressively compete for students and their tuition fees.While there is little recent evidence to show whether pupils with unconditional offers achieve disappointing final grades, private school heads have long been hostile because of the potential impact on their school’s results and league table rankings.Some employers pay close attention to A-level grades in recruiting for graduate trainee programmes, meaning that students who underperform may later struggle in the job market.The HMC’s call follows that of Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, who said in July that the rise in unconditional offers was “completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead by limiting the number they offer”.In most cases, universities make conditional offers, detailing specific A-level grades that applicants need to achieve to take up a place . However, greater competition has seen the use of unconditional offers spread to universities in the more selective Russell Group of research-intensive institutions.Ucas said the offers were more common for older students who already held qualifications, to creative arts course applicants who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties.Vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers as allowing earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b4897cf4756bcbd75d7694fbddb444ce04d6a0/0_356_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee6aca8b54937e523f1482aeb6dd4b5","title":"eye on the tiger the worlds largest ever exhibition of tiger photography in pictures","story":"London show brings together powerful and moving images from the world’s top wildlife photographers to raise awareness of the plight of these critically endangered cats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395473bec47e7053a6a69d1dcc953b622c85770a/0_249_6845_4108/master/6845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2695b706d6a746d3d1cf0b96cae32312","title":"anchor and hope review carlos marques marcet","story":"Two women want a child somewhat unequally in Carlos Marques-Marcet’s honest and compelling waterway filmSpanish-born Kat (Natalia Tena) and English Eva (Oona Chaplin) are a gleefully, almost nauseatingly happy couple who live on a funky reconditioned barge on which they chug along the canals of London. Neither has a particularly well-paying job – Kat wants to get deeper into boat-building but pulls pints at a pub, while Eva teaches salsa – but they get by on a steady diet of intense love, tequila and hot sex.A few key events lead to a realignment of their priorities: their beloved cat Chorizo dies, leaving a big pet-sized hole Kat’s best friend Roger (David Verdaguer) comes to visit from Barcelona, and Eva starts longing to have a child, particularly so someone else will remember her beloved, kooky hippy mother Germaine (Geraldine Chaplin, Oona’s mother in real life). Kat is less enthusiastic about the baby idea, but goes with the flow when Eva suggests they ask a willing Roger to donate sperm for their home insemination programme.Although there is a script here, credited to Jules Nurrish and director Carlos Marques-Marcet (his debut before this was 10.000 Km, which also starred Tena and Verdaguer, in that instance as hetero lovers), the dialogue feels utterly spontaneous, free-floating, and the core trio convince completely as well intentioned, smart, funny young people determined to live a little differently from the previous generation.However, that idealistic goal isn’t as simple as it looks, just like parenthood, of course. But what’s really compelling is how unobtrusively the big-theme stuff gets knitted in. Like a barge trip the pace is unhurried, observant, quietly contemplative. Marques-Marcet loves to hold on his actors as they simply walk down a towpath, or go for a morning run, thoughts flickering wordlessly across the faces like shadows cast by trees or clouds.

The accompanying TV series, Jamie’s Quick and Easy Food, was sold in to 121 territories.Paul Hunt, chief executive of Jamie Oliver Group, said: “The success of our media business, driven by the stellar performance of 5 Ingredients, Quick \u0026amp Easy Food, was fundamental to our ability to support the restaurant business and ensure its continuity.“With a reshaped restaurant estate, a new management team, and a focused investment plan backed by HSBC, we are making steady headway in a challenging market.”In 2015, Oliver shut the last branch of Recipease – his chain of cookery shops – and the last of his four British-themed Union Jacks restaurants went the same way two years later.

The player’s relationship with José Mourinho reached an all-time low this week when he was stripped of the vice-captaincy and the pair were involved in a frosty exchange at the training ground on Wednesday.Pogba has been at United since rejoining from Juventus for a then world-record fee of £89m in 2016 and Raiola wants to meet the club to establish whether they would be willing to let his client go in January or next summer. The agent also wants to wait until November to see whether Mourinho is still the manager.United did not contemplate selling Pogba last summer when Barcelona made an offer of £45m plus the players Yerry Mina and André Gomes, while Juventus did not bid because United told them there was no point.However, matters have escalated in recent weeks, with Pogba criticising the team’s style of play, saying they should “attack, attack, attack”, especially at home, and Mourinho taking umbrage at the player posting an Instagram video of himself in a jovial mood on the night of the Carabao Cup defeat against Derby County.Pogba, who has a contract until 2021, claims to be happy in England, happy that he is at United at this point of his career and happy with his teammates. The fact that his relationship with the manager is so poor, however, means he is open to a move.Raiola, in his meeting with United, wants to establish whether the club will keep backing Mourinho even if results and the general atmosphere around the club do not improve – and if that is the case he will start to look for ways out for the France midfielder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f587d5046ad9e2b23d4089a391f8c5a6b027c6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8904993fa339a8617ad510e7108401","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"The world’s most expensive keepers meet at Stamford Bridge, Emeryball is taking hold and time is not up for Marco SilvaWith Old Trafford currently resembling a passable imitation of the snake-filled Well of Souls into which Indiana Jones was temporarily sealed in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Manchester United will probably welcome an away trip, even if it is to the Premier League’s most ludicrous ground. With the exception of their lamentable surrender to Brighton at the Amex Stadium, Manchester United have performed better on the road than at home this season and now face a West Ham side that has rediscovered what passes for its mojo after starting the season with four consecutive league defeats. Declan Rice has been instrumental in their revival, acting as a defensive shield to a back four that has become compact and tight. Having neutralised Chelsea and scored eight past hapless Macclesfield in the past week, West Ham’s confidence is likely to be considerably higher than that of a Manchester United side who were outplayed by both Wolves and Derby County in the same period. Another poor result will prompt more tedious but unavoidable questions about José Mourinho’s future at the club and – far more seriously – may even have an adverse effect on the Apple Store rating of United’s mobile app. BG• Pogba’s agent to hold United talks in November over futureThere has been relatively little scrutiny so far on the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, largely because Kepa has not had a great deal to do since Chelsea bought him for around £5m more than Liverpool paid for Alisson three weeks previously. He looked a trifle shaky early on in his debut against Huddersfield and was at fault for Arsenal’s first goal in the following match but neither of those sides, nor any other, were able to put him through a really searching examination. That will probably change on Saturday, when Liverpool can be expected to give him his more serious test of the season so far. Something similar could be said of Alisson at the other end, although he is more experienced and, what is more, has a stronger defence in front of him. PD• Chelsea are match for Liverpool but Kanté poses midfield puzzleHere is a fact: Arsenal are not playing as well as their recent results suggest. Here is another: it does not particularly matter. Last Sunday they were largely bailed out by wasteful Everton finishing and an egregious misjudgment by the officials it was hardly fun and games in the wins over West Ham, Cardiff and Newcastle either but the results are, at least against the lesser sides, trickling in. It is a huge help to Umai Emery, who you suspect will need an entire season to really cement the cultural and stylistic changes he requires. There are signs Emeryball is changing Arsenal for the better – they have made more challenges and interceptions, and entered into more duels, per-minute of opposition possession than anyone else in the ision – but things are not quite clicking with the ball and for now they may have to be grateful for flourishes like Alexandre Lacazette’s super goal against Everton or Granit Xhaka’s free-kick at Newcastle. Watford will hope their run of good fortune does not last Arsenal would take three points in whatever form if it means their transition behind the scenes can continue without too much scrutiny. NA• Ramsey poised to leave Arsenal after club withdraw contract offerCrystal Palace need someone other than Wilfried Zaha to start scoring regularly for them. Andros Townsend netted twice in this week’s Carabao Cup win against West Brom but that is all he managed in the whole of last season and he has never scored more than four in a Premier League campaign. Maybe he is about to embark on a hot streak but the suspicion is that Bournemouth’s David Brooks, who has never scored a Premier League goal, will finish this season with a bigger haul than Townsend. The 21-year-old’s exciting play has been a highlight of Bournemouth campaign so far – shining even during last week’s lamentable trouncing at Burnley – and it seems only a matter of time before he starts finishing as well as creating chances from out wide, possibly as soon as Monday’s visit by Palace. PD• Football Weekly Extra: Carabao bangers and lucky cucumbersImproving with every performance, Wolves are proving a breath of fresh air in a Premier League in which no team more than Southampton increasingly resemble an acrid, eggy fart by comparison. Showing little or no indication so far that they’re either good or bad enough to do anything even remotely interesting this season, they look content to just hang around in the Premier League, as is their inalienable right if they can accumulate the requisite number of points. However, away at Molineux against a team of entertainers fast turning into media darlings, they have a chance to make a statement and turn some heads by putting the Premier League newcomers back in their box with an unexpected slap-down. Instead, expect them to troop off the pitch reasonably satisfied with a 2-0 or 3-1 defeat, after which Mark Hughes will use his post-match interview to grumble about some perceived refereeing injustice that only happened in his head. Surprise us, Southampton. The gauntlet is down. BG• Wolves’ Neves and Jota: ‘Porto has wine, food but here it’s fine’There is a lot to be said for wielding the axe quickly and decisively but calls for Everton to give Marco Silva the chop already are premature. He inherited a hotchpotch squad and, owing mainly to injuries and suspensions, has not been able to field his strongest team in his six league matches so far, yet Everton could still have won all of those if they had finished better. That, of course, is the team’s biggest problem – they have yet to find an adequate replacement for Romelu Lukaku despite all the money spent – and Silva needs to address that problem as best he can. On Saturday it could pay to deploy either Richarlison or Theo Walcott as a central striker, especially if Bernard is given a start out wide after his impressive introduction at Arsenal. If Silva persists with Cenk Tosun or Dominic Calvert-Lewin, he might find himself wishing that Everton, rather than Fulham, had signed Aleksandar Mitrovic last summer. PD• Everton move helped me to become England’s keeper, says PickfordThe statistics do not look especially good for Huddersfield. Twentieth in the Premier League table tells its own story but few of the trends underpinning it give hope of an imminent upturn. Their “expected goals” tally of 3.57 sits rock bottom of the pile, too, a good 1.3 shy of its closest rival their number of touches in the opposition box lags well behind everybody except Brighton while only Newcastle have managed fewer shots. They are leaking goals at the other end too and, while a fiendish opening couple of games against Chelsea and Manchester City are partly to blame, David Wagner’s side have not exactly served up much encouragement since. Quite simply they do not get enough players into enemy territory and they may find it difficult to commit too many men forward against a Tottenham team that, having cleared their heads with a 2-1 win at Brighton on Saturday, do not appear as vulnerable as they might have a week ago. These two teams have used more players (Tottenham, 23, Huddersfield 22) since the season began than any others in the ision bar Manchester United Mauricio Pochettino can point to strength in depth but Wagner really needs to find a combination that works. NA• Pochettino praises calmer, more mature captain AlliMartín Montoya was once tipped as the obvious heir to Dani Alves at Barcelona but things did not quite pan out like that. The 27-year-old has had a decent career so far, nonetheless, and has made a good impact at Brighton since joining the club in the summer. On Saturday he may have to produce his best performance yet for Chris Hughton’s side as he comes up against the team run by the manager who nurtured him when he was young at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola. Manchester City are likely to omit a couple of key players to preserve them for Tuesday’s Champions League mission to Hoffenheim, which they can ill-afford to botch after losing at home to Lyon, but this will be a fearsome challenge for Brighton whose only win this season has come against the lesser of the Manchester teams. PD• Foden laughs at Iniesta comparisons after first City goalHaving accumulated just their second point from six games in a dire scoreless draw against Crystal Palace last week, Newcastle entertain Leicester at the end of a week in which a tedious row has rumbled over whether or not they are a “big club” and Kevin Keegan has confirmed what many suspected about the cavalier, borderline cowboy manner in which Mike Ashley runs his St James’ Park operation. Only Rafael Benítez knows why he’s still bothering to man the tiller of this permanently listing ship, but having been handed a nightmare start to the season by the fixture generator, Newcastle can at least look forward to a comparatively kind set of fixtures – including Manchester United at Old Trafford next week – between now and their visit to Anfield on Boxing Day. By then, we should have a fair idea whether or not this side is well-equipped enough to continue treading water in the manner that so pleases its depressingly unambitious owner. BG• Kevin Keegan: ‘No, I’m not going to take a compliment from Ashley’Neil Warnock repeated this week that he prefers the Championship to the Premier League and it is not hard to understand why: a better balance of abilities thought the second tier makes intrigue run deeper. All the same, the Cardiff City manager will do his utmost to keep his team in the top flight this season. But the longer they go without a win, the harder it will be to fend off fatalism. Beating Burnley this weekend – after three defeats in a row – would do a power of good to the Welsh team and pull Sean Dyche’s side right back into bother after they got their first league victory last weekend. Warnock has several difficult selection posers to resolve, including whether to restore Sol Bamba to the centre of his defence and whether to entrust main attacking duties to Josh Murphy or persist with Bobby Reid. Whoever he plumps for, this is sure to be a full-blooded contest.

I can see why and no more so, in my opinion, than in regards to the women’s prize. Marta is one of my favourite players, and one of the best players I’ve had the privilege of coming up against, so I say this with the greatest respect: there are other players who were in a much stronger position to be named the best female player of 2018.Marta taking home the award for a sixth time has caused bafflement within the women’s game given the other more obvious candidates for the honour, such as Pernille Harder, who has had two very strong seasons, notably leading Denmark to the European Championship finals and scoring in the 2018 Champions League final for Wolfsburg. Harder was named Uefa’s women’s player of the year but didn’t even make the top three for Fifa’s award. Also Australia’s Sam Kerr, who finished as top scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League in the US for a second year running, a league widely regarded as one of the strongest in women’s football.Then there is my old Chelsea teammate Fran Kirby, who is coming off the back of an outstanding season, winning multiple inidual accolades, including the Football Writers’ player of the year, as well as helping Chelsea secure the double and scoring a crucial Champions League away goal at Bayern Munich. Yet, like Harder, Fran didn’t even make Fifa’s top 10.What adds to the sense of confusion is the fact that voting for the award took place between August 2017 and May 2018 in other words, during the European season. So how could a European player not win it?Why did Marta, a Brazilian, win? Probably because she has become a safe vote after many years of outstanding performances, but it’s a safe vote that does nothing to help raise the profile of women’s football. Greater accuracy of voting can be achieved by making sure the award is given to players who are in form and have made a big contribution to their respective teams, not only because doing so will give prominence to a greater number of female players but also because it will motivate them to strive for even more excellence.If, say, a striker knows that scoring 30 goals in a season will lead to them winning a prestigious award then they will try that little bit harder because, regardless of what players may say, inidual recognition on the world stage is important. On the flip side, if players are trying their hardest and posting great numbers but then see an inidual prize given to someone who doesn’t deserve it, then it devalues all of that hard work.Fifa must do more in this regard, specifically by ensuring that during the voting period as much content as possible, in terms of goals and footage of players from around the world, is seen by as wide an audience as possible. That way when people come to vote for the best female player they appreciate fully who the leading candidates are.Doing so is not difficult, either. For instance, there is no reason why a montage of goals and assists of the top-10 candidates for the women’s award cannot be put together and rolled out across social media at a specific time in the year. In a world overloaded with information and content, there is simply no excuse for fans to be ill-informed about women’s football.In regards to the men’s award, Luka Modric was a worthy recipient of the main prize. There is an obvious debate surrounding whether or not Cristiano Ronaldo should have won but Modric also claimed the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and was a key reason why Croatia finished second at the World Cup. For me, Modric leading Croatia to the silver medal in Russia is as great an achievement as Kylian Mbappé turning out exceptional performances for the champions, France, because of the relative size of Croatia as a nation. Let’s not forget that Modric was also named the best player at the World Cup, which on its own makes him a very strong contender for the Best award.Like most people, I do have an issue with the winner of the Puskas Award. I said in last week’s column that I’m a huge fan of Mohamed Salah but that goal he scored against Everton was nowhere near the best one scored in the world this year. For me, the award should have gone to Ronaldo for the unbelievable bicycle kick he scored for Real Madrid against Juventus. It was a stunning display of on-pitch gymnastics and one of those strikes that gets better each time you watch it.I remember watching it live, taking a video of the replay and being stunned at the sheer brilliance of Ronaldo. Given how Juventus fans who were inside the stadium that night reacted to the goal – with a standing ovation – it can also be argued that was the moment Cristiano’s love affair with Juve began, which in turn led to the most high-profile transfer of the summer.Speaking of Juventus, all of us in the women’s squad are bitterly disappointed to be out of the Champions League following our 1-0 loss to Brondby on Wednesday. We started very well, created clear chances in the first 30 minutes and should have won the game early. But we didn’t and at that level you get punished for not being clinical. Brondby then scored against the run of play and it became a bigger mountain to climb given we had to score at least twice after the first leg in Turin had ended 2-2. We tried our hardest but ultimately it was not enough.Without going over old ground too much, this is why the women’s Champions League needs to have a group stage. Yes, it’s up to us as players to get the job done but a straight knockout format means that the high levels of investment required to build European squads for clubs such as Juventus and Manchester City (who were also knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday, by Atlético Madrid) is put at risk too early by a tough draw. If you guarantee six group games in the Champions League, that investment becomes more worthwhile and players build a much deeper European experience.For us it’s now a case of using the disappointment and hurt of going out of the Champions League as motivation to win the Super Cup against Fiorentina, which is coming up soon, as well as retaining the league title. That’s certainly my ambition as well as the collective ambition of everyone at Juventus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1903fec8d675ec5ddef34dd4fded52676252102/400_181_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=540da7029ab9ae8f78fc012da29bc546","title":"premier league team news liverpool chelsea real madrid atletico buildup weekend football countdown","story":"Cardiff City cews, culled with love and affection from the wires.Neil Warnock has urged his Cardiff side to “hang in there” after their winless start to the Premier League season.Cardiff head into a crunch visit from Burnley on Sunday joint-bottom with two points from six games and fresh from 4-1 and 5-0 defeats to Chelsea and Manchester City.“The fixture list has not been kind to us, the first 10 games we play seven of the top teams from last year,” manager Warnock said.“It is a little bit cruel on us, but we just have to hang in there.

I didn’t understand why the other children weren’t having their pictures takenMy parents found out they were having quads four weeks before we were born. It was 1977. Mum was sent for an x-ray by her GP, at 30.5 weeks, because she was bigger than expected. She called my father from a payphone at Luton and Dunstable hospital, and sent him into total shock. She was admitted the next day.My sisters and I – the only boy – were born by C-section, six weeks premature and weighing 11lb in total. I came out third, and was the biggest at 4lb 4oz.There is a one in 700,000 chance of conceiving natural quadruplets, and there had been no history of multiples in our family. We have another sister who is 18 months older than us, so my parents suddenly had five children under the age of two.My grandmother came to live with us for six months and the local council gave us round-the-clock nursing help for 18 months. After that, my parents were on their own. They had two washing machines, two tumble dryers and a quadruple buggy. My father rarely stopped working, but always made time for us. I can’t imagine how he coped with the financial strain: writing cheques for four pairs of shoes, four lots of clothes, let alone five. I don’t know how he ever had a smile on his face, but he did.When we were young, everything was timetabled and regimented. My mother was in the kitchen before 6am every day. There was no time to play, bake or read with us inidually. She has since told me how much she wishes she could have had one-on-one time. My mother hated people referring to us as “the quads”. She wanted us all treated as iniduals. There were always four birthday cakes, and we never dressed the same.Our house was noisy, from playing or squabbling. Sharing was normal – I didn’t get my own bedroom until I was 10 or 11 – so I didn’t generally mind, but I sometimes felt left out when the girls played with dolls. They would say I was spoiled because my father took me to watch Luton Town on a Saturday. Two of my sisters are identical twins, so they had a particular bond.I didn’t realise we were different until we started school. On our first day, there was a row of photographers from the local papers waiting for us. I didn’t understand why the other children weren’t having pictures taken. Once, we appeared on an advertising hoarding at Heathrow Airport for El Al, the Israeli national airline. There had been a series of terrorist incidents and the airline approached us to appear, all lined up, in adverts to reassure families it was safe to fly. And then when we were about nine, academics from Leeds University came to study us. They asked us questions such as “What colour are you thinking of?”, to see if our minds worked the same way.As we grew into teenagers, our mutual competitiveness drove us to get good grades. At 15, I started to go out with my friends and gained more iniduality, although we’d usually end up at the same party. Three of us went to Birmingham Uni together. I was glad to have my own space, but always felt it was my job to look out for the others.People ask whether it was annoying to share my birthday as a child, but I just wondered what it was like for people who had theirs alone. There were 200 people at our 40th last year. It was harder to organise than our childhood birthdays, because these days we have different tastes, budgets and friends.There are 11 grandchildren now. My mother says they are her oxygen. We make sure we’re together every year on the anniversary of my father’s death. At his funeral, in 2013, I saw my siblings all waiting and I felt instant warmth. I thought: “This is going to be OK.” If something happened to me tomorrow, I’ve got at least three numbers I can call, and I think that’s more than a lot of people. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t pooping it before my wife had her first pregnancy scan. During all three pregnancies, there was a period where I was slightly anxious. There is definitely something special about being not just siblings, but siblings who share the same date of birth. I thought I couldn’t wait to get rid of them all, but Dad used to say, “You’ll appreciate this when you’re older.” He was right. Now my children have so many cousins and we have a big, readymade family, with all the joy that brings.• As told to Deborah LintonDo you have an experience to share?

The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs.

Ninety percent of them are based in London.Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a Manchester-based thinktank, said: “It is of course disappointing that the minister charged with the northern powerhouse spent so little time in the area getting to understand what’s important to the people, communities and businesses of the north.“But the attempts to thwart access to information about the work of the northern powerhouse minister show a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability.“The government need to use this as an opportunity to build a much more robust system of transparency and accountability, so that voters in the north can have confidence that the government are really serious and committed to supporting northern leaders to build a better future for the north.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: “We respect the outcome of the tribunal and have now released the information as requested.” They did not acknowledge queries about the low number of visits to the north of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2ec6337fcef8a5366a07d70d06c83975baf3f32/0_139_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f362aab383a03bc5c6006442ae31dc0","title":"brexit fatigue leaves british businesses unprepared for no deal","story":"BCC survey finds many firms have ‘switched off’ from UK’s imminent EU departureNearly two-thirds of businesses have yet to do any risk assessment of a no-deal outcome in the Brexit negotiations as “Brexit fatigue” sets in, the British Chambers of Commerce has found.With six months to go until the UK leaves the EU, the BCC said many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) were “either awaiting more clarity before they act or are suffering from Brexit fatigue and have switched off from the process because they don’t believe they will be affected”.Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said: “Too many businesses across the UK are still not ready for Brexit. Many smaller firms don’t have the capacity to scenario plan, don’t think they’ll be affected or have simply switched off from the process altogether.”A survey for the BCC found that a quarter of companies that import or export would cut investment if there is no deal.Edward Winterton, UK chief executive of Bibby Financial Services, which conducted the survey for the BCC, said: “The consequences of a no-deal outcome could be disastrous for the 5.7m SMEs in the UK, particularly for those buying and selling goods within the EU.”The BCC is now calling on the government to redouble its efforts to reach an agreement with the EU and launch a specific programme to help businesses prepare for change and prevent a slump in investment and recruitment.Last week the Dutch prime minister said his country was more prepared than the UK for a no-deal Brexit, and the Irish government launched a national campaign of events and workshops to help businesses understand potential changes in export regimes.Businesses that export to the EU will require a suite of changes in their operations, including knowledge of tariffs, rules of origin definitions and the demands of filling in 54 boxes of information for customs declarations forms required for each consignment.Exporters of food and agricultural products or animals will need to be informed that if there is no deal there will be an effective trade embargo in exporting to Europe because of a new layer of certification the EU will have to supply for a “third country”. The National Farmers Union has been told this could take six months.Marshall said: “With six months to go until the UK’s planned departure, firms still don’t have answers from government to the most basic questions about future trading conditions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a9550995006ef651c9b2b01b28e150e1993263/392_159_3860_2317/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=210a136b5f80628048c98cfa3af9d5b5","title":"derek hatton rejoins labour 33 years after neil kinnock kicked him out","story":"Hard-left ex-politician inspired by Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘passionate and powerful socialist leadership’Derek Hatton, the hard-left former deputy leader of Liverpool council, has rejoined the Labour party – 33 years after he was booted out by the then leader Neil Kinnock.Hatton was expelled for belonging to a left-wing militant faction. He caused national outcry in the 1980s by setting an illegal budget and was denounced at the 1985 Labour conference for sending redundancy notices by taxi to thousands of council workers.He and other members of a Trotskyite group known as the Militant Tendency were widely blamed for making the party unelectable during Kinnock’s tenure.Hatton has now revealed he was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership to reapply for membership.The 70-year-old, writing in the Liverpool Echo, said he spent much of the last 33 years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular at Tony Blair’s decision to invade Iraq.However, he said he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and that the recent Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin.He wrote: “In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics.“Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.He added: “Now I’m a ‘Labour party member’ I believe nothing should take our eye off the ball of securing a Labour government under Corbyn.”The Liverpool Echo reported that despite returning to the party, Hatton had no plans to run for public office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e4737fc6aff30680d49acca0f4acab87dd9d9e/21_75_3461_2077/master/3461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efdacce06891ebcd5d39809349b42fda","title":"hedge funds purchase of brexit vote polling data under scrutiny","story":"Treasury committee chair questions use of private polling to profit on pound’s fallPolling companies are facing parliamentary scrutiny over the sale of private polls to hedge funds during the Brexit referendum, which were used to place huge bets on the pound.Nicky Morgan, a Conservative MP and chair of the powerful Treasury select committee, has written to British Polling Council president, Sir John Curtice, warning that the use of private polling data during election and referendum campaigns could risk the integrity of financial markets.It follows a Bloomberg report earlier this year into private polling data sold by companies such as YouGov, Survation and ICM in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote.They were bought by hedge funds eager to cash in on extreme volatility in currency markets and profit from the result of the EU referendum, with several commissioning private exit polls in order to bet on the price of sterling.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that leave was to emerge victorious, netting millions for those on the right side of the bet.Immediately after the Brexit referendum polls closed at 10pm on 23 June 2016, the then Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, gave an interview to Sky News in which he said “it looks like Remain will edge it”.The news of an apparent concession by the leave campaign’s most prominent figure immediately after polls closed briefly pushed the value of sterling up to its highest level in six months.However, when the pound subsequently crashed as the true result became clear, any iniduals or companies with short bets would have profited. Shorting is the practice of selling shares or other assets which you do not own, in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price in the future and making a profit.Farage has denied placing currency bets against sterling and told Bloomberg in June that the only external exit poll he received on the day of the referendum was conducted by Survation. Survation’s poll correctly predicted that leave would win the referendum.He repeatedly told Bloomberg that he learned the results of the exit poll “minutes after” Sky broadcast his comments.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury committee and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It’s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, while providing more accurate – and lucrative – analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15ac8701bbce932b63fbaf93575dffdfeda8c6e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91988971c0d60d326d125342201870bb","title":"theresa may tory grassroots brexit tension boils over","story":"Conservative constituency groups backed the PM after Salzburg, but many are livid about her Chequers planOn a Friday night at a Conservative club in a slightly run down part of Hornchurch in east London, local party members gathered for a pint, a round of darts and to chat about the week gone by. Around a table in the corner, under the watchful eye of portraits of the Queen and Winston Churchill, the local constituency chair, Bob Perry, sat with several of his members.As they sipped their drinks, the conversation turned to Brexit. Earlier in the day, Theresa May had issued a message of defiance from No 10, having been humiliated by the EU rejecting her Chequers plan at the end of the Salzburg summit.The activists were dismayed. “They’ve treated both her and us appallingly,” said Perry. “She’s been tough today but I don’t think she’s gone far enough. But my respect for the prime minister has grown after today. A lot of people say she doesn’t have a backbone, but I think she’s shown them wrong. She has my sympathy.”Sandy Scott, a retired accountant, added: “This is going to be a terrible year for her. She’s trying as hard as she can, but the way she was treated was despicable.”There was a general murmur of agreement from around the table. Even though the Tory party grassroots were furious about May’s Chequers plans, the EU appears to have overplayed its hand.The prime minister’s decision to metaphorically wrap herself up in the union flag with her message of defiance in the wake of Salzburg has achieved its aim, boosting her street cred with the Tory grassroots.“We just want to get through party conference,” said one Whitehall aide. “We had been hoping for warm words at Salzburg to tide her over, but we didn’t get them. So we had to pursue a different strategy.”Downing Street has been starkly aware of the danger posed by bringing together thousands of febrile MPs and party activists at a time when May’s Brexit strategy was still hanging in the balance.“It’s going to be difficult,” acknowledged one senior No 10 adviser. “The PM knows the country, let alone the party, is very polarised and that she needs to get on the front foot to address that.” Uniting the UK after Brexit was expected to be at the heart of her conference speech.Back in Hornchurch, which sits in the Brexit-supporting heartlands where London merges into Essex, it is clear that while the membership’s sympathy could get May through conference, she still faces fierce opposition over her Brexit plans longer term.Perry described her proposals as unworkable. Scott added: “She’s trying her best to get a deal but personally I’d rather have no deal than a bad deal … If this country had a chance and an opportunity it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves.”Elsewhere in the Tory party the atmosphere has been more hostile. In a wood-panelled private dining room at a members club in central London last week, the executive committee of the group Grassroots Conservatives met to discuss the government’s approach to Brexit.Afterwards, the group’s chair Ed Costelloe, a former constituency chair from Frome in Somerset, set out his concerns. “The government and the prime minister have utterly failed to explain how we can do international trade deals while also following EU rules and how will that work,” he said.“If you’re selling something, it doesn’t matter whether it’s a washing machine or a treaty, you’ve actually got to say this is how it works. We haven’t had any of that. I cannot understand what kind of politics it is that says ‘this is a great deal, I’m the PM, I say so’, and there it stops.”Grassroots, a campaign group not officially affiliated to the party, has been deluged by hundreds of emails and letters from activists worried that the prime minister was going to compromise still further with Brussels.“Most people cannot conceive a situation where Theresa May can give any more concessions without totally losing face in the party and the country,” said Costelloe. “Unhappy would be far too mild a word. The membership would be absolutely incandescent.”Delyth Miles, another committee member and former constituency chair from Wales, added: “She has categorically stated that she won’t move her boundaries this time. I want to believe her very much but the outcomes she’s selling to us just don’t make any sense to me and not to thousands of our supporters either.“In all my years as an activist and building up the profile of the Conservatives and the membership, I’ve never experienced such anger and sense of betrayal from people. She’s totally betrayed us.”Hostility towards May runs deep. Costelloe, who has chaired two different constituency associations and speaks regularly to local chairs across the country, believes it has its origins back in 2002 when she offended thousands of members by describing them as “the nasty party”.The options available to the membership, currently thought to be around 125,000 strong, were limited. Their only real power, beyond lobbying local MPs and threatening to withdraw financial and campaigning support, was the final say on who becomes their next leader.Costelloe said: “We’re not making a big stir because of this business of loyalty to the prime minister. We’re not campaigning to change the leadership. The question to ask is would the next general election campaign be led by Theresa May? That’s the key question because I think she has lost the trust of the average Conservative voter.”May’s departure has been widely regarded as a matter of when, rather than if, and activists have openly discussed who might succeed her. Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson’s names come up the most frequently. In Hornchurch, Rees-Mogg will be the star guest at next month’s constituency dinner. Tickets sold out immediately.Others believed the party needed a fresh face, although they conceded May could hang on. Grant MacMaster, a 17-year-old student who has just joined the Hornchurch Tory association, said: “I’m moving towards somebody who isn’t particularly outspoken about Brexit because after Brexit I think there needs to be domestic consensus.”There has been deep frustration at local level at the party’s perceived lack of interest in the grassroots. “They don’t want to know. Talk to any Conservative association. Many will feel that CCHQ and a certain caucus in the upper echelons of the party hold the local associations more or less in total contempt,” said Costelloe.But they have a warning for the government. “They rely on us for financial support and our time but they need to remember we are also expressing the views of Conservative supporters in terms of voters. At the moment there’s real bitterness and frustration out there in the country,” said Miles.While they may feel dejected that the MPs harbour most of the power in the party, rumours of deselection of remainers to assert their authority seem wide of the mark. “There is a mechanism, but why would we want it?” asked Perry. “The possibility exists but it would be extremely rare,” Costelloe said.Tory MPs warned of the threat of entryism over the summer after the former Tory donor and Ukip backer Arron Banks urged thousands of Leave.EU supporters to “flood” the Tory party to elect a “true Brexiteer”, such as Johnson or Rees-Mogg. But the threat did not come to pass.“We have a new computerised membership system which would enable us to recognise a spike, and we haven’t seen one,” said one senior CCHQ official. “Banks is good at publicity but rubbish at logistics. I could be a teenager having a party at my parents’ house with 100 people and say there were loads of people. It’s all relative.”In Hornchurch, over another round of drinks, the group, which also includes Perry’s wife Carol and MacMaster’s mother Karen, agreed that despite the prime minister’s desire to strike a deal, they would prefer to crash out rather than accept Chequers.“We’d all love a deal but the deal has to be on our terms, not the EU’s terms,” said Perry. “I know he’s Ukip but Nigel Farage made a very valid point when he called them gangsters. These people are just bully boys.” The fragile truce in the wake of Salzburg could come to a brutal end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1089adab6d5bfd49e213712e0050e9e236e68630/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a69ece3b4f91668533647907610a4cea","title":"lewis hamilton refreshed stronger russian grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes he is stronger than ever as he prepares for the Russian Grand Prix this weekend. The British driver goes into the race with a 40-point advantage over his title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, and is confident he and Mercedes will prove competitive in Sochi.Six rounds of the world championship remain and Hamilton goes into them firmly on the front foot. He has won four of the last five races and comes to Russia on the back of a dominant win at the last round in Singapore, after which he took a break which proved beneficial.“I feel healthy, happier and stronger than ever,” he said. “It still feels like it has been a long year. But I have had plenty of time to myself, and some really good quality time with family, so I do feel really good for this last stint.”Hamilton is attempting to secure his fifth F1 title, and fourth with Mercedes, but he emphasised that he was still constantly pushing his team. “We are all stuck in our ways, it is hard for us to change,” he said.“When you work with engineers it is similar and breaking patterns and moulds and challenging people, that’s what I live to do. I am a pain in the arse to my engineers, because I am always challenging. I like to think it has a positive impact to spring an idea or a direction to push the car.”Last year the Russian Grand Prix took place early in the season and Hamilton struggled with performance, particularly in working his tyres, and finished fourth. Now he is more confident. “I believe this weekend we will be in a better position than we were last year,” he said. “Our understanding of the tyre is far greater than last year but it’s still a challenge.”Vettel could still take the title if he won and Hamilton was second in all the remaining races and in Russia he insisted he was focused on keeping the fight alive. “I think it’s very simple from where we are,” he said. “We are some points behind and we need to catch up to make sure we stay there.“That’s our target and the best way to do that is to finish ahead, and ideally ahead of everybody. So the plan doesn’t really change. Obviously at this point we try to give it everything we have and I still believe that we have the chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2bb2085a923d03e76bf1242f0d26fafdb09a7f/0_93_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4645af5e4e42564fb66e9d75937e468c","title":"sophie wright world road race scale heights","story":"• British teenager will be supported by Dani Rowe in Innsbruck• Dutch duo Van Vleuten and Van der Breggen start favouritesIn one of the most mountainous world road race championships ever held, and in the absence of Lizzie Deignan - who has just given birth to daughter Orla - Saturday’s women’s title race in Innsbruck will give a chance to new British riders to shine, among them this year’s shooting star Sophie Wright, the 19-year-old former mountain bike racer who unexpectedly lit up the European championship in Glasgow in August.The Norfolk rider transferred from the Great Britain mountain bike squad to the road in the spring, having decided that she wanted a career in road racing, after winning the European junior mountain bike title and two national championships off road.She was immediately rewarded with victory in the Tour of the Reservoir national road race series event, but it was the European championship where she truly came to prominence, with a crowd-pleasing 60-kilometre escape, largely on her own, that gained her a three-minutes lead at one point. Wright did not make the medals in Glasgow, but her move worked as planned, as it paved the way for late attacks from her leader on the day Dani Rowe, who will also be part of the Great Britain team in Saturday’s race.Her courageous solo effort also earned her a WorldTour professional team place with Cervelo-Bigla, for whom she rode strongly in the recent Tour of Tuscany. It all marks a rapid progression since 2017 when she had two operations to solve a cardiac issue which resulted in her heart beating at up to 256 beats per minute.“She’s like a coiled spring. It will be exciting to see what her youthful exuberance can achieve on the course on Saturday,” said the Great Britain women’s road team coach Julian Winn, who played an influential role in Nicole Cooke’s Olympic gold medal in Beijing and has tracked Wright’s progress since spotting her in a mountain bike event several years ago.“I don’t want to put pressure on her, I just want to see her have a straightforward race with no mechanicals, and not getting caught behind any crashes. I’m sure she can climb with the best and get in that front group.”Rowe, meanwhile, will look to build on some promising performances this season, including second in the Tour de Yorkshire, third in the Women’s Tour and bronze in the Commonwealth Games.While the field includes strong climbers in Cecilie Uttrup-Ludwig of Denmark, Amanda Spratt of Australia and the Tour de Yorkshire winner Megan Guarnier, all eyes will be on the Dutch duo Annemiek van Vleuten, gold medallist in the time trial on Tuesday, and her team mate the Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen.In Glasgow at the European championships the Dutch squad were dominant but rode a tactically disastrous race and were outwitted by the sprinter Marta Bastianelli in Innsbruck the volume of climbing means that is unlikely to happen again. “On this course you either have good legs or you haven’t,” said Winn. “There will be no tactics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d19f670eb0e46dfdb9634bdef472b3402bc2033/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f471f8dea00d3bd5ffc7e6274156679c","title":"tiger woods back ryder cup usa","story":"Amid a resurgent 2018, Tiger Woods’s greatest challenge may still be his health, as he plays with a back barely held togetherTiger Woods is back. For the moment at least, with last week’s win at the Tour Championship, he has quieted the demons of the past – the injuries, the drugs, the DUI arrest.Now, with a return to Ryder Cup playing action in France this week, his performance ascendant and his personal life under control, Woods’s greatest challenge may still be his health, as he plays with a lower back held together by plates and screws.Playing a sport not normally associated with a high rate of injury, Woods has a history – ACL surgery, four back surgeries, achilles injuries and an MCL sprain – more commonly seen in athletes who play contact sports. According to Dr Robert Watkins III, a Los Angeles-based spine surgeon, it’s those injuries that likely triggered Woods’s back problems.It’s plausible that the ACL injury and surgery to Woods’s left knee, as well as the achilles and MCL injuries to the same leg, interfered with his ability to transfer weight and generate twist on the leg, transmitting that stress to his back. Because, to hit the ball with the same force, Woods had to generate speed from somewhere else, likely a more extreme coil and release of his hips and back with every swing. That cascade of events likely worsened with disc herniations and subsequent back surgeries further compromising the area.“I think with a past medical history there is less margin for error, a loss of muscle tissue in the legs and back, possible nerve damage, all of those can be risk factors for injury,” says Dr Jo Armour Smith, an expert on back injuries and golf at Chapman University in Southern California.Because, like a pitcher’s elbow or a skier’s knees, a golfer’s back is both his biggest asset and weakest link, generating the force that hits the ball 300 yards but bearing the stress of each swing.For the spine, golf can be considered an extreme sport. The twisting, flexing and arching of a golf swing can place a tremendous amount of stress on the lower back. While much of the twisting is performed by the vertebrae of the middle part of the back, the thoracic spine, the stress to the lower back is as high as eight times bodyweight.This modern swing, termed the one-plane swing by bio-mechanists, is characterized by twisting the torso over a relatively fixed pelvis, coiling the trunk and producing both power and compression of the spinal discs. Increasing this so-called X factor can increase the velocity of the club head, meaning more distance of the tee, but it comes at a cost.“The golf swing is a pretty extreme movement because it combines asymmetrical movement (always swinging the club in the same direction), extreme twisting, and on top of that, the sport is very repetitive. I don’t think any other sport replicates that type of extreme motion over and over,” says Smith, a researcher at Chapman University.And like professional baseball pitchers whose arm problems are a result of thousands of throws in Little League, so too can the swings of amateur golf wear down the back over time. “Golf puts a lot of stress on the back, especially for those that start at eight or 10 years old,” says Watkins.Because the epidurals, shots, and two micro-discectomies – a procedure performed after a herniated disc has placed pressure on nerve roots in the lower back – failed to conquer the constant nerve pain that left him unable to perform even basic daily life functions, Woods underwent a spinal fusion surgery.The fusion procedure (anterior lumbar interbody fusion), performed by Dr Richard Guyer of the Texas Back Institute, replaced the space between the L5 and S1 vertebrae with a bone graft in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the spinal nerves. Though that level of the spine has naturally little rotation, the procedure eliminated future motion in any direction, augmenting the bone graft with rods and screws for internal stabilization.After Woods’ procedure, Guyer was optimistic about a return to golf. “If you are going to have single-level fusion, the bottom level is the best place for it to occur. Some iniduals are born with one less vertebrae, which would be similar to someone who had a single-level fusion.”While emphasizing he was not part of Woods surgery, Watkins agrees that a fusion in the lowest part of the back offers the highest odds of success, in part because the approach maintains the natural shape of the lower back and doesn’t compromise the paraspinal muscles. “The type of fusion he had was a terrific solution to the problem, L5S1 is the best one to fuse,’ he says, “If it’s solid you can return, and, in that perspective, it salvaged a career.”Dr Michael Cole, a bio-mechanist at Australian Catholic University, believes that Woods has made several important alterations to his swing to lessen the stress to his knee and back, likely because of the alleviation of his chronic pain.“First, he (Woods) no longer exhibits the trademark hyperextended spinal position that is often referred to as the ‘reverse C’ position, but rather he finishes his swing with a much more upright position,” says Cole, “And second, he also allows his lead foot (left foot) to rotate a little towards the target, ultimately reducing the twisting forces that act on the lower spine.”But Cole also highlights that these changes don’t come without a cost. “Having said all of that, the performance of a powerful golf swing inevitably involves very large forces that the various structures of the body are required to endure. Although these technique changes may serve to reduce the forces that are placed on Tiger’s lower back, other structures may be required to endure increased forces to compensate.”He adds, “Unfortunately, this is the knife’s edge upon which all professional athletes exist constantly looking to balance their need for an advantage over their competitors with the need to manage the physical stresses that they are placing on their bodies.”While Woods has proven he can again rise to the top of golf, can his body sustain the performance needed to keep in there? Smith is unsure, citing the problems that can occur at other discs after the fusion. “In my experience, many feel a lot better right after that surgery but eventually begin to feel symptoms again.”But for now, Woods has been given another chance to establish himself as the greatest golfer of all time. Whatever his future holds, his triumph at the Tour Championship and return to the Ryder Cup required more than just physical ability. Though the Tiger of old was there on Sunday for all to see, the tenacity was even more evident in the effort he put into his rehab and recovery.Watkins appreciates the difficulty of returning to professional golf after a significant back surgery, and the hard work that it required. “I admire his tenacity and work ethic and dedication to his rehab. It’s a recovery story, and very inspirational.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549f1c669ff2ce31bedf76221e70d5a9d0e7b57d/517_484_4337_2602/master/4337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478b14a7a57cd0919d5aac6e18ff4906","title":"ryder cup 2018 europe v usa day one live golf fourballs foursomes","story":"Europe have been losing momentum, with the galleries a little subdued ... but no more! Justin Rose is in thick stuff front right of 12, down a bank, chipping blind. He looks out of the hole. But he whips his ball up onto the green, and sends it rolling towards the cup. It’s on target, but does it have enough pace? No, no, no ... yes! In it drops, just. Rose cracks a smile a microsecond before it drops, then explodes in delight as the ball disappears. He squats on his haunches and pumps both fists, screaming COME ON! That’s got everyone going again. And now Europe are 2UP with six to play.Casey and Hatton need to do something quickly. Casey knocks his second at 10 to 12 feet ... but then Spieth replies by arrowing his to six. And then Thomas strokes one in from the fringe at the back for birdie, so Spieth doesn’t even need to putt! Suddenly Casey’s left with a tricky one to save the hole ... and he makes it! That’s kept Europe holding on. Meanwhile Olesen sends his tee shot at 11 over the flag. It’s 15 feet behind. It earns him a putt for the hole ... but he seriously overcooks the birdie effort and it’s always staying high on the left.Birdie for Fowler at 10, and that’s back-to-back wins for the USA in the second match. They’ve turned that around in short order. Meanwhile finally something drops for Koepka, who chips in smoothly from the side of 11 for birdie. Neither Rose nor Rahm could make medium-distance putts, and suddenly things look a lot more promising for the US team, less so for the hosts. Ah the ebb and flow of match-play golf!Koepka is doing his darndest to get the USA back into this opening match. His tee shot at the par-three 11th lands 15 feet from the flag ... though it’s just off the green. The crowd give it plenty anyway, no doubt fuelled by pints of delicious refreshing continental-style alcoholic lager beer. Plenty of that to be spotted in the bouncing parties lining the fairways. And why not? It’s Friday, it’s nearly lunchtime, and it’s France. Wine soon.Rahm has taken to the Ryder Cup like ... well ... a Spaniard to the Ryder Cup. Following in the footsteps of Seve, Ollie and Sergio, he’s wowing the Ryder Cup gallery with some crazy golf. A par is salvaged on 10 with an outrageous chip in from the front of the green. The crowd go wild, and the mood brightens even further when Rose rolls in a birdie effort from seven feet. That was missable, and necessary too, because Koepka was less than three feet from the hole. In goes his birdie putt, and it’s a half.Reed and Woods pepper the flag at 7. They’ve both got looks at birdie from ten feet. Fleetwood offers a smidgen of resistance, but his par putt drifts by on the right. That final match is all square again, as is the second Europe were in all sorts of bother from the get-go, and when Fowler bumps his third shot to a couple of feet, they’ve got no option but to concede. Suddenly, everything looks so different! It’s nip and tuck this morning all right.Nothing’s quite coming off for Hatton and Casey. At the par-three 8th, the former clatters the flagstick with a chip from the right-hand edge of the green, but his ball doesn’t drop the latter nearly drains a long birdie putt, but it horseshoes out. The hole’s halved. Another half, at the par-five 9th in the opening match. Back down the hole, there’s more trouble for Europe: Olesen is already wet, and McIlroy flays his drive into thick oomska down the right, and can only advance his ball 20 feet with his second. Olesen finds the water for the second time today, a booming drive on 9 taking a slightly unlucky bounce to the left and dribbling into the hazard. Meanwhile more Golf Fever news, courtesy of Simon McMahon: “I know they say never look back but I can’t help but rewind four years to 2014, when I attended the Ryder Cup matches at Gleneagles in Scotland. To have been part of the history of this incredible event, even as a spectator, still gives me a warm glow inside. I like to think I made the difference that weekend. Strange how the most inidual of sports provides the pinnacle of team events. There really is nothing else like the Ryder Cup, and that’s coming from someone who regularly attends lower league Scottish football.”It’s all very scrappy on the par-three 8th, where Olesen is able to win the hole with a workaday par. Europe will care not a jot: they’re now up in three of the four games. Not that it means too much right now it was only 40 minutes or so ago when there was no blue on the board at all. Plenty of ebb and flow left in these morning fourballs.Rahm is Europe’s star turn this morning, but he’s got nothing on Spieth. The former Masters, US Open and Open champion trundles a chip in from the fringe to the left of 7! That’s a birdie, and another hole won by Spieth from a not-particularly promising position. The USA are in full control of the third match. As much as Spieth has been sensational, Casey and Hatton haven’t got going at all.Meanwhile some very sad news. James Lawton was unquestionably one of the greats. He reported on many a Ryder Cup, stylishly so, and would no doubt have enjoyed this one too.Neither Koepka nor Finau hit the green at the par-three 8th. Rahm arrows one straight at the flag, though he’s left with a 15-footer for the birdie he may need to win the hole. The American’s can’t chip in for unlikely birdies, though Finau goes close Rahm then rolls in his putt, and hollers in delight! Another Spanish Ryder Cup idol is born! Meanwhile Olesen misses a birdie effort on 7 Casey passes up a chance at 6. It’s tight this morning. It’s been wonderful to watch.Koepka nearly completes an absurd escape for the USA on 7. He knocks his third to 12 feet Rose can’t make his long birdie putt. The four-footer Rose is left with isn’t conceded. Koepka looks to have made his par putt, but the ball somehow doesn’t break right when it surely should, and that’s a bogey. Rose rolls in his putt to win the hole. Had Koepka salvaged something there, it would have been quite special given his drive was over 100 yards off line, forcing him to embark on adventures in the jungle. Not quite. But he really is some player he gives nothing up. Spieth drains a 40-footer across 5! It was never missing. Casey can’t follow him in from half the distance, and the USA have taken control of match three. Meanwhile on 7, Koepka - whose drive went 120 yards wide left - can only lash the ball out of grass that’s as tall as him, and hope for the best. The ball finds the fairway, but then bounces into the first cut and sits deep. Finau takes a drop and finds the green in four Rose follows him into the heart of the green in two. Koepka and Rahm will be hitting three into the green. Advantage Europe in that one.On 4, Reed very nearly knocks in a greenside chip from 60 feet. It’s a wonderful effort, but that’s just a par. Tiger, having found trouble from the tee, is out of it. But Fleetwood has knocked his second pin high to five feet. In goes the birdie putt, and Europe regain the lead in the final match!From hero to zero in double-quick time: Finau flays his tee shot at 7 out of bounds down the right! And then Koepka sends his drive bouncing into thick hay on the other side of the fairway! The US are already in serious bother on this hole. Hatton has a birdie chance on 4, but his 20-foot putt dies off to the right. Spieth still has work to do for the half, but never looks like missing his par putt from 15 feet. That’s quite magnificent. Fowler nearly makes a 25-footer for the win on 5, but his effort drifts wide. And up on the driveable par-four 6th, quite the dramatic sequence! First Rose lets go of his driver in frustration, yet his ball lands on the green anyway. He’ll have a look at eagle. Koepka hits some poor punter upside the head with his drive, then chunks a chip. But no matter, because his partner Finau’s drive is on the fringe just to the right Finau gently guides a delicate chip into the hole, and it’s an eagle! Rose can’t make his 35-footer - he’ll have been preparing to putt for the hole, not the half - and the USA have snatched it! What a chip by Finau, who looked nervous early doors, but has found his feet in the Ryder Cup now! Match play golf, ladies and gentlemen.Tiger is in the zone now. His second at 3 finds the thick stuff down the left, but that’s not a bother from 50 yards or so, he flicks a crisp wedge over sand to a couple of feet! That’ll be a birdie, though Fleetwood has a 50-footer for eagle. Southport’s finest sends it dead on line ... but doesn’t hit it! Which means if Reed makes his chip, he’ll win the hole. But he’s uncharacteristically heavy handed, and the ball flies way past the cup. In the end, it’s Molinari who saves the day for Europe, getting up and down from a tight spot in front of a greenside bunker for a birdie to match Tiger’s.Olesen has a 12 footer on 4 to win the hole. He watches in horror as a putt that looks like dropping kinks off to the right on its very last turn. Back on the par-five 3rd, there’s a lucky break for Reed who bounces out of the bunker guarding the front right of the green, and will have a makeable chip for eagle Fleetwood finds the heart of the green but he’ll have a long eagle putt And finally to the 5th, a hole with relatively little danger and a friendly pin position. Can anyone in the opening group make birdie? Nope! Rose’s effort from 15 feet drifts left, and Finau saves the half with a six-footer.Hatton and Spieth halve the par-five 3rd with birdies. Meanwhile in Golf Fever news, here’s Matt Dony: “Argh, I love the Ryder Cup. The depth of feeling is entirely summed up by the way I feel about Ian Poulter. For 23-and-a-half months out of 24, mention his name, and I’ll immediately make some disparaging joke about that time he said that if he plays to his potential, it’d be just him and Tiger. Put him anywhere near a Ryder Cup, though, and I love the man. He doesn’t even need to play. I can just read a paragraph about him walking down some steps, and I’m cheering him on. Go on, Poults. Walk down that grandstand! Show those yanks how we walk! Get in, son! (I will be struggling to focus in work today.)” You and me both, Matt.Neither Molinari nor Fleetwood can get particularly close with their sand shots on 2. Reed flicks a lovely wedge to a couple of feet, though, securing par. Both of the Europeans end up making bogey, so Tiger doesn’t even need to make his birdie putt. He tucks it away regardless. And the final match is all square again!Koepka must have kept his putter in the minibar fridge last night. He’s got another putt from ten feet or so, this time on 4, and he leaves it a little short. This is very strange behaviour, and Europe escape again, keeping hold of the lead in the opening match.Fleetwood and Molinari take turns to push 4-irons into a bunker back right of the 2nd. They’re spooked by the water it’s the safe bail-out. Reed nearly follows them in, but his ball sticks in the thick rough instead. Then Tiger decides enough is enough: he goes straight for the flag, and lands a sensational long iron four feet from the hole! Speaking of the great man ...It’s been a dramatic morning already. Plenty of to-and-fro action. Though not on the 2nd yet another match goes through without a tale to tell, Casey, Hatton, Spieth and Thomas sharing the spoils. But at 1, Tiger can’t make his birdie putt from the fringe, and flicks his ball away in irritation. That’s because he knows the Open champion isn’t going to miss a straight one from eight feet - and Molinari, ice cool, rattles it straight into the cup. Europe go 1UP in the final morning fourball. The par-five 3rd is halved meanwhile, as Olesen’s birdie effort from 18 feet never looks like dropping.Tiger is looking a bit nervous. Well, it’s been a while since he’s been in the Ryder Cup cauldron. Having toyed with the water down the left from the tee, he nearly spins his second back into the drink guarding the front left of the green. He hangs on, in the fringe. Molinari screeches a fine second to eight feet. There’s pressure on Reed now ... and to the gallery’s delight, Captain America dunks his wedge straight into the water! Advantage Europe there.Hatton can’t make his birdie putt on 1. Spieth makes no mistake from close range, and that’s the opening hole to the USA! And there’s another surprising escape for Europe, this time on 3 Rahm does extremely well to get up and down from the rough to the right, chipping to 12 feet, making the birdie putt and beating his chest with his fist. Koepka then misses his third putt in a row to the right he really deserved an eagle after that magnificent second, but Rahm put the thumb-screws on. That’s matchplay golf! The final match gets underway ... and here comes Tiger Woods and Captain America! Reed gets pelters from the crowd, as you’d expect ... and as you’d expect, he shrugs them off with a smile and sends his tee shot away down the middle! Tiger meanwhile looks a little pensive, and sends his iron a little too close to the water on the left for comfort. But it’s fine. Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari meanwhile hug each other, smiling broadly as the crowd sing their praises. And their nerves are settled by a couple of calm drives. It’s all four balls in the fairway. And all of the matches are out on the course!The 3rd is the first par five on the course. It’s a monster ... but Koepka calmly negotiates his way down the hole with a 340-yard drive and an easy iron to eight feet! Rose and Rahm meanwhile struggle, the former very fortunate not to find the hazard down the right with a wild tee shot, the latter sending his second near trees down the left. Advantage USA. Meanwhile in the second match, it’s a no-drama half.Casey is in the thick stuff down the right of 1 ... and lets his club snag through the rough as he wedges in. It’s never reaching the dancefloor, and slam-dunks into the drink guarding the front-left of the green. It’s all down to Hatton, who sends his second over the flag to ten feet. That’s a fine shot, but quickly put into the shade by Spieth, who lands his second a couple of feet past the cup and spins it back. It looks like dropping for a sensational eagle, but hits the stick and stays out. That’s going to be a birdie, though, unless Spieth has a Dustinesque rush of blood.Back on the opening tee, the grandstand has got a little tired of the panto booing, perhaps saving some energy for later. Justin Thomas pushes his drive into the cabbage down the right, but Jordan Spieth knocks his down the middle. Paul Casey’s tee shot leaks to the right, in the first cut, but Tyrrell Hatton opens his Ryder Cup career with a gorgeous one down the track. It’s been a mixed bag from the rookies so far shaky starts for Olesen and Finau, but confident ones from Rahm and Hatton. Dustin’s missed tiddler, though he really let the Europeans off the hook there.The par-three second is a fierce one over water. The green’s pretty shallow, there’s not much landing space. Rahm sends his tee shot 50 feet to the right of the flag Rose is just off the back, but only 12 feet or so from the cup. Rahm lags a gorgeous putt up to a couple of feet Rose clunks a heavy handed chip eight feet past. But he knocks in the one coming back. Koepka has another look for birdie from 12 feet, but again it stays out on the right. And on the 1st green, McIlroy can’t make his 20-foot birdie putt ... but DJ yips his tiddler to the right and Europe escape with a half! Oh Dustin!DJ follows the Rose Route down 1. A glorious wedge. He’ll be making birdie from there. That means McIlroy has to respond ... but he doesn’t, really, his second landing 20 feet right of the hole. He’ll be left with a very tricky downhill breaker to save the hole for Europe.Europe make the first move in the 2018 Ryder Cup! Koepka’s ten-footer is a downhill dribbler, and it stays high on the right. An inch away from a birdie. But Rose is within kick-in distance, and that’s the hole to Europe. Rose holds his fist in the air in quiet determination. It’s not quite the 17th on Sunday at Medinah, but it is only Friday morning after all.Back on the tee, Dustin and Rickie are announced the crowd try to boo, but there’s plenty of cheering too, they can’t help themselves, Johnson and Fowler are just too damn popular! Rory and Thorbjorn are showered with the love you’d expect. Fowler’s drive finds the rough down the right DJ fires an arrow down the middle with a long iron. Then a nervous looking Olesen sends his tee shot towards Finau Country ... and the rookie’s first shot in Ryder Cup competition plops in the drink. That will hurt. It’s all down to McIlroy for Europe now, and he splits the fairway with his drive.Finau might have stayed dry, but he’s right on the edge, and technically in the hazard. It’s all he can do to take his medicine and punch his ball back onto the fairway. Rahm then fizzes his second to ten feet! That puts real pressure on Koepka ... and the three-time major winner responds by knocking his second ten feet over the flag. That’s kept the USA in this hole ... and how they needed that, because Rose has just wedged to a couple of feet. Koepka will have to hole his birdie effort to halve the hole, you’d think. Finau on in three.Well, I said the phony war was over ... but the US players were stopped and security checked as they arrived this morning, while the Europeans simply swanned into their team room unfrisked. A final attempt at some mind games? Dear oh dear. Anyway, the players take to the tee, and it’s an end to all that nonsense. Nearly. Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau are booed in the pantomime style as they are announced Justin Rose and Jon Rahm cheered to the skies. The atmosphere seems to unnerve the rookie Finau a little he blows out his cheeks hard, and nearly whistles his tee shot into the drink down the left! One more joule of energy, one more drip of adrenaline, and he’s wet. But it just hangs on. Europe’s rookie, by contrast, is the picture of confidence: Jon Rahm waves his arms like Bubba and Poults, generating an even louder cheer ... then cracks his tee shot down the middle! A small early victory to Europe? We’ll see. But all these little things count. Meanwhile Rose and Koepka stay out of the limelight, and on the fairway. It’s started! We’re under way! It’s on!Here we go, then. The phony war is nearly over the real thing is about to begin! There is, as you’d expect, a neck-hair-bothering atmosphere already at the first tee, where fans of Europe and the USA are whipping it up with chants of Allez Allez, plus a choreographed version of the Icelandic football team’s patented Thunderclap performed much too quickly. The grandstand behind the tee is huge you’ll need to take 94 steps to reach the top. Ian Poulter has already made an appearance, theatrically making his way down that staircase from its summit to wild applause. Vague shades of top 1980s quiz The Price Is Right. In your dreams, a smiling Leslie Crowther would have been at the bottom to greet him such a shame the whole scene wasn’t soundtracked by the old Come On Down music.For the benefit of folk who fancy getting up on the downswing this weekend but don’t always follow the greatest sport in the world, we usually cut and paste the following explainer. Hey, if it’s worth reading once, it’s worth reading a dozen times. Here we go ...The format: The 42nd Ryder Cup Matches, to use the official title, is a matchplay event. Each match is worth a point. There are 28 points available over the three days, so the first team to get to 14.5 points will win the Cup. Should the Matches be tied at 14 points apiece, the USA will retain the trophy as current holders.Match-play explained for those dipping their toe into the murky world of golf for the first time: In common-or-garden championship golf, such as the Open or the Masters, tournaments are scored using the stroke-play system. Whoever takes the fewest shots over all four rounds in a championship wins. All shots count and are added up for a cumulative total. So if, say, in next year’s Masters Tiger Woods shoots 63-63-63-63 and Rory McIlroy shoots 87-87-87-87, Tiger will have taken 252 strokes, and beaten Rory by 96 shots. (You’ll get good odds on that happening at Augusta National next April, if you enjoy the sound of metal on porcelain as you flush the contents of your purse down the lavvy.)Anyway, in match play, each player or team wins a hole for every hole they better their opponents. So if Tiger takes five shots at the 1st, but Rory needs only three, Rory goes 1up. If Rory wins the next hole too, he’s 2up. If the pair share the same number of shots on the 3rd, the hole is halved, and Rory remains 2up. It doesn’t matter if Tiger took 13 shots on his way to losing the 2nd, by the way a bit like the unwritten rule of visits to coin-lavvy-interface-venue Las Vegas, what happens on each hole stays on each hole. There is no knock-on effect.So let’s say McIlroy wins the first nine holes of our make-believe match. With nine played, and nine remaining, Rory is 9up. Tiger can only tie at best McIlroy can’t lose. This is known as dormie. (And more specifically, in this slightly ludicrous example, as dormie nine.) If Tiger wins the next nine, the game will end all square, and each team will get half a point to their overall total. But if Rory wins the 10th, he’s 10up with eight holes to play. He has won 10\u0026amp8. If the 10th hole is halved, Rory would be 9up with eight to play. He’s won 9\u0026amp8. Similarly Tiger can be said to have lost 9\u0026amp8. Europe would add a point to their overall total. I’ve probably made this sound way more complicated than it needs to be, but there it is anyway.There will be three types of match: foursomes (teams of two players use one ball, taking alternate shots) fourballs (teams of two players play a ball each and take the best score, known as the better ball) and singles (this is when it gets quite wild and everyone across two continents starts with the shallow breathing and chest clutching). And these matches are arranged in a schedule like this:Today: four matches of morning fourballs four matches of afternoon foursomes.Tomorrow: four matches of morning fourballs four matches of afternoon foursomes.Sunday: 12 singles matches.Finally, some parish notices. This MBM reporter makes no apology for ... outrageous pro-European bias outrageous pro-Sergio bias outrageous pro-American bias through the prism of a self-hating European paying no heed to think-of-the-kids sermonising should Hatton or Reed lose the place completely, and enjoying every second of it too childish excitement childish tantrums childish tears. Hey, it’s all part of the fun. Get on board.And here’s your cast-iron, no-quibble, GARANTIE OFFICIELLE !!! There’ll be not a single mention here of Brexit. This solemn pledge also covers other original satirical observations and biting stand-up bits on: golf being a good walk spoiled golf not being a sport because players don’t require the aerobic conditioning of the Brownlee brothers mashed potato bababooey people in golf clubs wearing clothing from the 1970s people in golf clubs having attitudes from the 1970s Donald Trump. None of that here. Let’s go!It’s been a quarter of a century since the USA beat Europe away from home. Spool all the way back to 1993, when Tom Watson’s side triumphed at the Belfry. Davis Love sealed the deal against a tearful Costantino Rocca ... then as his team-mates cavorted and partied, made a point of searching out the distraught Italian to give him a hug. But since then, it’s the Americans who have been in sore need of a consolation cuddle whenever they’ve come over the pond, suffering heavy defeats at The K Club and Gleneagles, and going down at Valderrama, The Belfry (again) and Celtic Manor too.Well, they’re favourites to break that inexplicably long, sorry sequence this time. Jim Furyk brings a hell of a side to Le Golf National, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines: it contains no fewer than nine major champions. Between them, this USA team have 31 majors to their name. That stat alone will send a shiver down European spines, because Thomas Bjorn can only call on five major winners, and they’ve only got eight majors between them. Oh la la!In any case, it’s not as though Europe are about to be shoved into the lion’s den armed with neither whip nor chair. They’ve got the world number one and new FedEx champ, $10m’s Justin Rose, in their ranks for a start. Rory McIlroy is a bona-fide superstar. Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have enjoyed seasons to remember. And as for the entertainingly fiery Tyrrell Hatton ... well, he’s a Ryder Cup legend in the making, he’s just got to be. Hey, Sergio’s none too shabby either. Or that Jon Rahm. Or Henrik Stenson, Paul Casey, Alex Noren, etc., and so on.So in conclusion: (1) the USA have one hell of a team (2) Europe have one hell of a team (3) may the best team win (4) this promises to be three days of sensational sporting theatre (5) I’m wittering platitudes, but very excited so please cut me some slack (6) actually, there’s been an outbreak of severe Ryder Cup fever, someone please call Dr Golf and (7) IT’S ON!United States of America: Bryson DeChambeau, Tony Finau, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Bubba Watson, Tiger Woods.Non-playing captain: Jim FurykThe morning fourballs start at 7.10am BST.

I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.”Tesla and its board told CNBC that they were “fully confident” in Musk after the lawsuit was filed.

Major domestic carriers such as ANA also have discount tickets for overseas visitors. Long-distance buses can be up to half the price of the equivalent route by bullet train. Companies such as Willer Express provide multi-day passes from £67 for three days to £100 for seven days. The cheapest option of all is hitchhiking: as long as you don’t look too scruffy, Japanese drivers are very accommodating of hitchhikers though some basic Japanese is recommended. Many izakaya (taverns) offer all-you-can-eat (tabehoudai) and all-you-can-drink (nomihoudai) menus from around £20 a head. Nomi-tabe menus can also be found at large karaoke places such as Big Echo. For cheap sushi, seek out the ¥100 (around 70p) conveyor-belt restaurants such as Sushiro or Genki Sushi. Hole-in-the-wall ramen joints and “vending machine” restaurants such as Yoshinoya are also great, with set meals from around £3-£4. Tips are actively refused in Japan, but many restaurants and bars have a seating charge (usually £3-5pp). This charge presents itself as an otoshi, a small, unordered appetiser. Inquire with staff for details and avoid switching between bars and restaurants too often to avoid racking up multiple charges. If you can read Japanese, restaurant website Hot Pepper has discount coupons for many restaurants.Most temples (Buddhist) and shrines (Shinto) are free of charge except in Kyoto where visitors have to pay to enter many temples. Museums almost always charge. Many day trip locations outside major cities (for example, Hakone or Nikko, both near Tokyo) offer passes that combine transport with free or discounted entry to local attractions. Ask at tourist information centres in major rail stations.Avoid Golden Week (late Aprilearly May) and cherry blossom season (mid-April) when prices increase drastically, particularly in Kyoto. Instead, visit in mid-March to catch the other spring highlight, plum blossom. The rainy season (mid-June to mid-July) is also cheaper and less crowded.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Now another supreme court nominee stands accused. Has nothing changed?‘A bit nutty and a bit slutty.” This phrase, used by David Brock in his book The Real Anita Hill, is one I will always remember. Hill was a lawyer, who had acted as an adviser and assistant to the judge Clarence Thomas towards the start of her career she then moved into academe, and when Thomas became a US supreme court nominee in the early 1990s, nominated by the first President Bush, Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment.In October 1991, in publicly televised hearings, she said that Thomas had asked her out socially when she was working as his assistant. She added that he spoke graphically about his sexual prowess, talked about women having sex with animals and pornographic films that showed group sex or rape scenes apparently, he also once asked “Who has put pubic hair on my coke?” after examining a can on his desk.As the judiciary is a branch of the US government, nominees are, in many ways, forced to behave like political candidates, and it was understood that nominations could be “borked” – defeated by any means necessary – the word coming from the blocking of Robert Bork, another rightwinger, in 1987. When Thomas’s nomination was announced – and the Republicans desperately wanted a black conservative, which he was, in the post – Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, declared: “We’re going to bork him.”This was more than 25 years ago. The culture war is not new we go backwards and forwards, and now have another supreme court nominee and more allegations of a sexual nature. But something is shifting. I remember the Hill hearings being shot through with racial and sexual politics. Was this just another hi–tech lynching of a good black man? Hill was accused of being both too poised and also, devastatingly, of being a sexual being. It was his word against hers. I wrote at the time: “For whatever did or did not happen struck a chord with so many women in particular that they felt that what was being told was some emotional truth beyond the comprehension of men in suits.” Others, of course, wrote that only mad, witchy, rad fems believed her at all the columnist Barbara Amiel said, with typical understament: “It seems fair to say that America today, vis-à-vis feminist thought, is at the point Germany reached before the Nazis took over.” Whoa!I wonder what has happened over the years. I wonder, frankly, at my own reticence in not believing Hill to have not clearly connected the sexual harassment she described to my own. Yes, she is speaking an emotional truth I had said, thinking somehow that that might not be the same as an actual truth.Why? Because my own experience and that of my generation involved tolerating a certain level of harassment, quasi-assault and rape as the price we paid for working, travelling, wanting to have a life, to be independent. I always knew that seeking equality was risky. Stuff would happen to you, sexual stuff, slights and outright harassment, and it was a sign of strength that you didn’t complain. The humiliation was internalised. The shame was shoved down the back of your throat. There was little choice about swallowing or spitting. A lot of women swallowed our hurt, but then we found ourselves regurgitating it, often at inappropriate times. I never liked the word trauma: it seemed too dramatic to describe the things men did, or tried to do, to you. We were taught not to be dramatic.When I read Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against Donald Trump’s current supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, it stuck in my throat. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” she has said. Her allegation is that, back in 1982, at a party, when she was 15 and he was 17, Kavanaugh locked her in a room with his friend Mark Judge. Kavanaugh was on top of her and was trying to get her clothes off. Judge allegedly egged him on, and also told him to stop at various points. Kavanaugh was very drunk. Blasey Ford is now a professor. Since the allegation, Deborah Ramirez, who went to Yale with Kavanaugh, has alleged in the New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh thrust his penis against her face when they were both drinking at a college party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and Judge says he never saw Kavanaugh behave in that way.But now another woman, Julie Swetnick, has said she attended “well over 10” house parties in the 80s where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. She said she saw Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behaviour towards girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, ‘grinding’ against girls and attempting to remove or shift girls clothing to expose private body parts”. In addition, she says she saw “efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys …” She herself, she went on to say, was gang raped at a party where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. They have yet to respond to these new allegations.The US president, an unrepentant sexual predator, hasn’t been put off by the earlier allegations against his supreme court pick. Trump has not used the phrase “A bit nutty and a bit slutty“ about Blasey Ford because, apart from anything else, he does not read. But he has dismissed the women who have come forward as drunken, politically motivated Democrats.Let’s be clear: Kavanaugh is not accused of rape and is not in court he may simply not get the job he wants. He wants that job badly enough to have gone on Fox News this week, sitting alongside his concerned-looking wife, and telling us that he was in fact a virgin during his high school years – as if this means he has never disrespected women. His somewhat holier-than-thou persona is, of course, at odds with his yearbook entries these involve him and many of his former classmates slut-shaming a woman called Renate (a large number of them referring to themselves as “Renate alumni”) and alluding to his legendary drinking.It is possible that this man engaged in hardcore frat-boy antics, but never did anything bad to any women. Strangely though, all the things he is accused of are performances for other men, a botched show of sexual prowess and potency. The women concerned are vessels to be exchanged in this cementing of male friendship. This is common enough for it to be ordinary. Just a thing guys do. It will be a rare woman who doesn’t experience a shudder of recognition on reading these allegations, and an instant passport to incidents that occurred in their own teenage years.The rhetorical question that keeps being voiced is: “What boy hasn’t done this in high school?” The idea of pinning a girl down against her will and making her feel she may die is apparently thoroughly normal. The answer to this is surely that a lot of boys haven’t, and never would, that it is not OK now and was not OK in the 70s or 80s, an era now spoken of as unwoke compared with the present, where we know what is and is not acceptable.This is patently rubbish. We know that many teenage girls are wearing shorts under their skirts so as not to be groped at school shots from hardcore porn films are now used as screensavers and girls commonly fear being shamed on social media. We know about the incredibly small chance of a rapist being convicted in this country, and the character assassinations of female accusers. We know that some girls are deemed uncredible. In the UK, the police described certain girls in the Rotherham grooming cases as “unrapeable” children who had blood running down their legs.But it is in the US that we more usually see these high-profile rape trials play out, such as that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman. His father said afterwards that his sentence was: “A steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of 20 years of his life.” A brutal sexual assault was reduced to 20 minutes of action. What did that 20 minutes of action take from the woman who was raped? And what was the sentence that was deemed too harsh? A six-month sentence in county jail, of which he served three months.Even if Kavanaugh did the things he is accused of, does it matter all these years later? Is it possible to be out of control as a young man – and perfectly respectful of women as an older one? It probably is, but it woud require a degree of honesty, a glimmer of self-reflection at least. Instead, Kavanaugh is now involved in some peculiar audition before the US public, in which he is presenting himself as the most perfect young man who ever lived.That this pantomime is being performed while we watch another – a zombie-like Bill Cosby, cuffed and unrepentant, finally being taken to prison – is odd, to say the least. It took the testimony of more than 60 women and many years to bring Cosby down, and still we wonder if he is perhaps too old to be imprisoned. At what age is one beyond justice?Kavanaugh’s alleged “crimes” are small fry compared with Cosby’s. Who will judge the judge at the judiciary hearing on Thursday? Other men, it turns out 11 of them, but with “a female assistant” they have hired for the occasion. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Again, in this story as in so many others, women are wives and assistants. In this ideological battle, even the GOP are uneasy. It just may be that, as has been alleged, Kavanaugh insisted his clerks be pretty, that women look a certain way. Trump does the same. It is the way things always were. It is the way they are now emboldened to be again.Stephen King nailed the boys-will-be-boys mantra. He tweeted that Kavanaugh may have drunk hard and partied heavily: “Those behaviours change with age,” he wrote, “but the attitudes and assumptions which drove those behaviours rarely do.” It seems to me perfectly possible that a man who is now a “carpool dad” did what he has been accused of. If sexual assault was only carried out by monsters, it would not be part of most women’s experience of growing up. This is what #MeToo has revealed. Here, then, we get the push back.Interestingly, many conservative women are unhappy with Kavanaugh, too. They are unsure they understand why women don’t always come forward with accusations of rape and assault. The unease comes when experience and belief systems clash. For any women this is difficult it is easier to shut up and shut down about much of this. The #MeToo movement has opened up a conversation about pain ordinary pain, what so many of us accept as just stuff that happens. We don’t want this for our daughters. That much we do know.So, 27 years on from Anita Hill, we are not yet at the stage of believing women because it is still so uncomfortable even to listen to them. Men will decide if this man is fit to sit on the supreme court and make judgments over what women do with their bodies. If appointed, he will be on the supreme court for life.This man says he behaved honourably, while some of his fellow students remember a belligerent drunk. I don’t know if he put his hand over a woman’s mouth while he was on top of her. I do know too well what that feels like though.This is not only about Kavanaugh. It is about the silencing of women while decisions are made for us – and about us. It is about power God forbid the nutty and the slutty – as all women are ultimately perceived – should speak the truth in these televised hearings. Women voters will watch this though. And they will watch, carefully, the men in charge who get to decide who to believe – and who to silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00beb43ce75c2cad0a50eabbca2fccf35c05598e/0_38_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6b2a48cc2e9da52c514897805c64584","title":"brett kavanaugh christine blasey ford hearing analysis","story":"In an era of bile and tribalisation, Christine Blasey Ford displayed the calm temperament of a judge while the supreme court nominee lashed outThe senators told Christine Blasey Ford that she was not on trial. They told Brett Kavanaugh that he was not on trial. But America’s political culture was on trial. And the verdict was guilty.All the bile, all the ugliness, all the tribal politicking of Republican-controlled Washington in 2018 was on display as the Senate judiciary committee met in a cramped room on Capitol Hill on Thursday. It was a dark spectacle that offered a glimpse of the state of the disunion.In this upside-down era, it was the accuser who was sober as a judge and the supreme court hopeful who was angry, indignant, tearful and deeply politicised, throwing out allegations of a vast leftwing conspiracy. In short, he was channeling Donald Trump.The gender ironies were inescapable. The actor and activist Alyssa Milano, who was present in the room, tweeted: “If a woman were to yell, interrupt and cry while being questioned, people would call her unhinged or say she had a melt down.”First, Ford delivered one of the most powerful repudiations of Trumpism since the first lady Michelle Obama’s speech at the 2016 Democratic convention in Philadelphia.Fighting back tears, she also spoke searingly about the long-term effects the incident had on her life, including “anxiety, phobia and PTSD-like symptoms”.It was an account likely to have struck a chord with thousands of women in America and around the world. It was another defining moment for the #MeToo movement. It was also guaranteed to give Trump a dose of air rage as he flew from New York to Washington.Gabriel Sherman, a journalist at Vanity Fair, tweeted: “This is Trump’s worst nightmare: a TV moment going badly for him that’s completely out of his control.”Democrat after Democrat praised Ford for performing a public service. Richard Blumenthal told the university professor that she had given America “an amazing teaching moment” and “inspired and given courage to women”.Cory Booker said: “You are speaking truth that this country needs to understand: how we deal with survivors who come forward right now is unacceptable. The way we deal with this, unfortunately, allows for the continued darkness of this culture to exist. Your brilliance, shining light on to this, speaking your truth, is nothing less than heroic.”Kamala Harris added: “You have bravely come forward and I want to thank you. History will show you are a true profile in courage.”Ford looked deeply moved by each intervention. Contrast this with the stony silence of the 11 Republicans on the committee, all men, broken only by the chairman Chuck Grassley – a veteran of the 1991 Anita Hill drama – who grumbled about Democrats’ actions, and tart interventions from Lindsey Graham, clearly itching to wage war.Grimly aware of the imagery – with its echoes of the male chauvinist bullying of Hill when she testified against Clarence Thomas – the Republicans hired a female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell. The plan backfired. In a poor performance, Mitchell’s five-minute bursts of questioning went rambling down obscure byways, such as Ford’s fear of flying, and failed to cut to the heart of the matter.Perhaps the ultimate measure of how badly things had gone was Fox News, the conservative network that cheerleads for Trump and shapes his thinking. In a disputed anecdote, President Lyndon Johnson reportedly said of the broadcaster Walter Cronkite during the Vietnam war: “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America.” Kavanaugh had lost Fox.Judge Andrew Napolitano, of whom Trump is a fan, said on the channel that Ford “is extremely credible and Rachel Mitchell not only is not laying a glove on her, but in my view is actually helping her credibility by the gentility of which these questions are being asked and the open-ended answers that the witness is being permitted to give. The president cannot be happy with this.”The Fox News political analyst Brit Hume said: “I would say this about her credibility - the more hesitant, the more fragile she has seemed, the more powerful and credible I think she comes across to the audience.”The pundits’ advice was that, just as Thomas did 27 years ago, Kavanaugh could only save himself by coming out all guns blazing. He did, delivering a fiery opening statement that alleged “a calculated and orchestrated political hit” and raging against a “national disgrace”, “circus” and “grotesque and obvious character assassination”. It was a white-privileged Chevy Chase version of Thomas’s “high-tech lynching for uppity-blacks”.Kavanaugh gave an interview to Fox News earlier this week and appeared to have caught the bug. He railed against Democrats, the Clintons and the media, accusing them of destroying his life, family and reputation. His tone towards Democratic senators was combative and disrespectful, bristling at questions about his drinking habits. The performance was reminiscent of the White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s debut, berating reporters over the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd.It made a mockery of Kavanaugh’s past claim that “a good judge must be an umpire – a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy”. Susan Glasser, a journalist at the New Yorker magazine, tweeted: “Anger and partisan fury like this will be very hard for Judge Kavanaugh to overcome as Justice Kavanaugh.”Crudely, however, the fury seemed guaranteed, perhaps calculated to please Trump and his counter-punching instincts. The president tweeted: “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!”Republican members of the committee circled the wagons. Most aggressive was Graham, whose soul is apparently being slowly poisoned by spending time with the president, and who may be angling for the attorney general job. He unleashed a furious tirade: “This is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics … You’re looking for a fair process? You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend.”But Kavanaugh’s emotional breakdowns were less likely to impress Trump, who has previously mocked “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer”. The judge was overcome with emotion as he told how his 10-year-old daughter wanted to say a bedtime prayer for Ford. He repeatedly sniffed and stuck his tongue into the inside of his cheeks.The Senate judiciary committee, which Republicans control, is scheduled to vote on Friday. The matter then goes to the full Senate. Kavanaugh’s fate rests in the hands of a few Republicans and the lesson of Thomas in 1991 is that nothing should be taken for granted. But even if Kavanaugh succeeds, any hope that he can be seen as an impartial, politically neutral member of the nation’s highest court now lies in tatters. The Foxification of American institutions continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01aad3d3130f316c8561cdd83cb0d5fe4c4d2e2c/116_0_3166_1900/master/3166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=451ee9fb43f898c0de41c7c1fab22b72","title":"christine blasey ford and brett kavanaugh testify in pictures","story":"Supreme court nominee and his accuser have taken part in a full day of extraordinary testimony on Capitol Hill"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584c8dc3ab8853c2550705a2d35ddb99a483d7d7/0_24_3372_2025/master/3372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d56234d6249d26ffb2001ca570034058","title":"un security council north korea sanctions china russia pompeo","story":"Countries break from US at session chaired by Mike Pompeo, marking the second setback for the US in as many daysChina and Russia have broken with the US over the maintenance of sanctions on North Korea, arguing they should be relaxed in view of the “positive development of the past few months”.The rift became apparent in a session of the UN security council called by the US and chaired by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. It suggested that the international consensus over North Korea, which had led to a steady escalation of sanctions since 2006, had stalled in the wake of a flurry of summit diplomacy by Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington.The security council foreign ministers meeting on Thursday marked the second diplomatic setback for the US in two days, the day after Donald Trump was roundly rebuffed by other world leaders when he sought to gain support for the reimposition of sanctions on Iran.Pompeo’s task at the security council in maintaining a solidarity over sanctions at a time when the US president has been claiming his summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June represents an historic turning point.In his own introductory remarks, the secretary of state called it “the first significant diplomatic breakthrough in decades”.Kim agreed to the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” at the Singapore summit, but the Pyongyang regime interprets the phrase to mean a drawn-out process of multilateral disarmament, not the unilateral dismantling of the North Korean arsenal.So far it has only begun dismantling a missile engine testing site, which may have become obsolete as North Korean technicians have moved from using liquid fuel to solid fuel for long-range missiles.In supporting Pompeo’s call for maintaining sanctions, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, gave a more modest assessment of the consequences of Singapore, saying: “We note the lack of concrete steps so far.”“Action counts for more than assurances,” Hunt said. “Deeds must follow words.”His Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, backed the call for loosening the sanctions, arguing: “Any negotiation is a two-way street. Steps by the DPRK toward gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7659e8ae8a28500bbcb67cfeb77becda535b0064/0_264_3958_2375/master/3958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92493ef37bf2d5f47fb7468ea67591db","title":"perus last incan city reveals its secrets its genuinely a marvel","story":"Espíritu Pampa, forgotten for centuries, was cleared, and the latest findings, a planned site museum and fieldwork are bringing attention to the last stronghold of the Incas Jorge Cobos follows the remnants of an Inca road down the eastern slopes of Peru’s Andes, through cloud forest and over swaying plank bridges, edging along narrow paths beside sheer drops.Finally, after a four-day trek, he clears a patch of undergrowth with his machete, revealing a moss-covered wall. Thick roots are entwined around fallen lintels. Elsewhere, the stonework is still daubed with orange plaster.“Imagine – there are lots of buildings left to discover in the forest,” he said. “And beyond, in the mountains: who knows?”The sprawling ruins are, scholars agree, the last capital of Vilcabamba: a holdout Inca state that resisted for decades after the conquistadors landed in Peru in 1532, executed the emperor Atahualpa, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco.Forgotten for centuries, the city of Espíritu Pampa – also known as Old Vilcabamba – has only been cleared in recent decades.And the latest findings, a new site museum and fieldwork both scheduled for 2019 – along with the pending completion of a road through Vilcabamba – are bringing attention to the last stronghold of the Incas once more.Architect and explorer Vincent Lee first mapped out Espíritu Pampa in detail in the 1980s, when the region was under the control of brutal Shining Path guerrillas.“It was a step back into the 19th century just to go there – and a potentially dangerous one,” he said.The jungle “was so thick one could hardly see one building from the next,” Lee added.Today, three government workers use machetes to keep the foliage at bay from a palace compound, the remains of a huge hall with 26 doorways, and a labyrinth of rooms, streets and stairways. “The area is fascinating because it still hasn’t been disturbed or looted. The information is firsthand,” said Javier Fonseca, an archaeologist with Peru’s ministry of culture.“It’s the last capital of Inca resistance,” he added. “It has history, it has archaeology, it has everything. It’s genuinely a marvel to work in this place.”Four successive Incas ruled in Vilcabamba, venerating the sun, engaging in diplomacy and guerrilla warfare with the Spanish – and inspiring rebellions beyond their mountain refuge.Facing an overwhelming invasion in 1572, the Incas set the city ablaze and fled into the forest. The Spanish captured Peru’s last indigenous monarch Túpac Amaru I and executed him in Cusco, bringing the Inca empire to an end. Espíritu Pampa was swallowed up by the jungle.Yet recent research points to a far older origin for the site – and to a web of connections linking Vilcabamba with its European and indigenous neighbours.In one sector of Espiritú Pampa – dominated by towering matapalo trees that grip the ruins – Fonseca pieced together a unique ceramic vessel depicting Andean and Amazonian peoples, backed up by jaguars, united in battling the mounted conquistadors.Perhaps the most intriguing discoveries at Espíritu Pampa concern the Wari – a predecessor culture to the Inca that ruled swaths of Peru between 600 and 1100AD.In 2010, Fonseca identified a sumptuous Wari burial complex near the main site. One occupant – dubbed the Lord of Wari – was found with a silver mask, breastplate, axe blades and ornaments, golden bracelets and dozens of finely crafted vessels.And late in 2017, Fonseca identified a Wari temple nearby, containing both Inca and Wari gold and silverwork.“This society doesn’t disappear overnight. Part of the Wari inheritance survives, thanks to the Incas,” he argued.These cross-cultural finds are currently ided between minor exhibits and storage units, Fonseca lamented, but there are plans to build a museum in Vilcabamba in 2019.The Cobos family would like to see it established in Huancacalle, the small village by Vitcos from where explorers have long set out on foot for Espíritu Pampa.But some fear this buccaneering tradition is coming to a close. Archaeologists are currently mapping the Inca path – to avoid any damage from a highway due to be extended into the valley below.The new road is eagerly awaited by some Vilcabamba residents, mainly Quechua-speaking smallholders who barter potatoes, yuca, coffee and cuy (guinea pigs) to get by.Even if it becomes more accessible, the last city of the Incas will still inspire wonder, and new techniques such as Lidar mapping may soon reveal the true extent of the city beneath the forest canopy.“I’m sure there’s a great deal more to uncover,” said Thomson.Benjamín Cobos, 90, agreed. As a boy, the Machiguenga peoples that lived at Espíritu Pampa told him of yet another city, even deeper in the forest.“They said you have to walk for five days, along a wide Inca road,” he added. He once followed a barefoot indigenous guide, scrambling up densely wooded slopes for hours.“But, because I didn’t care about ruins then, I turned back.”"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"How graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersJobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interviewMy career path: Sybil Smyth is a trainee at Deloitte\u0026rsquos tax departmentMy career path: Stephen McGrath works for the property department at LidlGraduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectors"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3643846.1538073449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we had to take a stand mother of incorrect leaving cert points student","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Carter of Castlebridge in Wexford leaves the High Court, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe mother of Rebecca Carter, the student who won a High Court case against the State Examinations Commission after her points were incorrectly counted, has spoken of the big risk the family took to pursue the legal case.The student has been allowed to take up a place in veterinary medicine in UCD after the court directed the commission on Wednesday to correct her points tally by the end of the week.Annmarie Carter said the family had to think long and hard before making the decision to take the case, as it could have had serious financial implications for them“We’re just a normal family, it’s not that we had the means,” she told her local radio station South East Radio.“We sought legal advice and they said to us ‘you have a very strong case for Rebecca, this can go either way, you can win your case and the respondent will pay court fees, you can lose your case and there are serious implications of fees involved.’“We had to think long and hard about that, but we said, you know what if we really believe that we have a case when our legal team did, us as a family, together with Rebecca thought everybody says that’s just the system don’t change it, we decided, Becky has this opportunity now to stand up for her rights and battle it out come what may.“We’ll worry about the money when the time comes, but be under no illusion we do not have millions of euro.”She said her daughter was “phenomenal” and the whole family was so proud of her.“We cannot afford the challenge. We would be in a very different boat had the judge not ruled in Rebecca’s favour, thankfully justice was served.“I don’t know how we would have come up with the money. But that was the risk we had to take. For Rebecca and for future students so that they don’t have to go through what Rebecca went through.”Rebecca herself explained the background to the case to the Morning Mix radio show: “Last year I was 12 points short, which is the equivalent of two per cent because I had received 88 per cent in four of my exams, if any of those had been 90 that would have been those 12 points, this year I was 6 points short of first round offers and then for second round it went down by 5 points, so I was one point short.“I got 554 points in the Leaving Cert, had the mistake not been made I would have received 566 points which surpasses the amount for first round.”She added that in his ruling on Wednesday, High Court judge Mr Justice Richard Humphreys recommended that the SEC change their policy and that the appeal process will be completed before the academic year starts.“Hopefully they will take those recommendations on board so no other student will have to go through what I did, he warned them that he doesn’t want to see them there next year with the same case.”Her mother added that they could understand human error, but they could not understand the bureaucracy of the SEC and why they could not rectify the mistake.“Everybody that we spoke to at the SEC said ‘our hands are tied, we cannot just open the script and take the 10 marks deficit and add it to the front page and increase the grade from a H2 to a H1’.“For everybody else it’s the simplest thing in the world, to say ‘sorry, we made a mistake there’, but it couldn’t be done. They would not do it outside their normal appeal process.”She told of how the previous year her daughter had been 12 points short for veterinary science which was very disappointing after the amount of work she had done.The family said if that was what she was determined to do they would support her but that she would have to “knuckle down for one more year, hard as it is, put the head down and go for it again next year and we supported her throughout the whole year. She’s phenomenal.”Rebecca added that she was fortunate to have accommodation organised.“Hopefully on Monday morning I’ll be sitting in UCD in the lecture hall among the other veterinary first year students.”The past week had been overwhelming and stressful, she said. “It is quite daunting. A lot of the time you don’t understand what’s being said, I had to ask what was happening.“The Judge was quite hard to read, it was difficult to see how it was going, it was only in the last five minutes when he announced his decision that we knew we had won.“Even at that it wasn’t until my Junior Counsel Brendan Hennessy turned around with a big thumbs up to me. In that moment that was when the smile broke out on my face.”Annmarie added: “We’re so proud of Becky for standing up for her rights and her convictions. She truly worked so hard for this moment, she deserves every bit of it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3644482.1538119804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit ni secretary says only may s chequers plan meets uk s objectives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said the  Chequers proposal is ‘a good deal for Northern Ireland”’. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty Theresa May’s Chequers plan is the “only proposal” that delivers on Britain’s objective to leave the European Union, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said. Speaking in Washington DC at the end of a four-day visit to the United States, Karen Bradley said the UK was committed to working with the EU on its concerns about the Chequers deal. But she stressed that is was the only viable option on the table. Ms Bradley said the UK government wanted to “take control of our laws our border and our money, we’re going to have an independent trade policy, and we’re absolutely committed to no border in the island of Ireland. There’s only one proposal that delivers that and that’s the proposal put forward. There is no other option that delivers on those objectives.”Ms Bradley said Chequers proposal is “a good deal for Northern Ireland” and a proposal that works for the “island of Ireland.”Addressing the fall-out from the Salzburg summit when EU leaders rejected Ms May’s plans, Ms Bradley said that Chequers is “not an easy answer for the UK,” noting that the prime minister had lost 13 members of her own government due to the proposal.”Pressed on how Britain would solve the border challenges in Northern Ireland presented by Brexit, Ms Bradley said: “We cannot see a system where there are two customs territories within a sovereign country,” but she also said that there could be no border on the island of Ireland. “70.5 million people voted to leave the European Union. As the government we have to respect that vote. We don’t want to stay in the European(Union) by the back door,” she said, adding that the Government was following through on what the British public asked them to deliver. She added that British people no longer wanted “bureaucrats in Brussels” dictating trade policy. Ms Bradley was in the United States meeting business, political and civic leaders in the United States. Her visit coincided with prime minister May’s visit to New York for the United Nations general assembly where she told US business leaders that Britain would have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G20 after Britain leaves the European Union, and would be an attractive, pro-business place to invest. Ms Bradley met a series of business leaders in Boston, including tech companies Rapid Seven and Black Duck, companies which have invested in Northern Ireland. “My message is that Northern Ireland is open for business. We may not have an executive, but in Northern Ireland is still functioning, is still striving, still succeeding.”She said Britain’s special relationship with the European Union would continue after Brexit. “The United States is the UK’s closest and more important ally. No two countries in the world do as much and share a much as we do. As the UK does leave the European Union we want to continue building on that incredibly relationship.. so we can stand there as beacons of free trade, beacons of freedom… values that we share.Noting that Northern Ireland is “a very different place” than 20 years ago when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, she said that 50 per cent of the population is aged 40 or under, unemployment is at record lows and tourism is booming. “Northern Ireland is a real success story,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Microman is the smallest star in Mexican professional wrestling.Mexico\u0027s lucha libre, a wildly popular mix of sport and entertainment, long featured small figures and dwarves in a deeply demeaning role: they were mascotas - a word that can mean both mascot and pet - for full-size wrestlers.But a new generation of little people are now rising lucha libre stars in their own right, and dream of one day headlining the main events on their fight cards.Microman wowed a skeptical crowd at one recent bout in Mexico City, where he and two co-stars, El Gallito and Guapito, took on another team of small-sized wrestlers.He and his fellow Micro Stars were met with a smattering of jeers when they got in the ring.But Microman silenced them when he climbed onto the top rope - more than three times his height - to execute a high-flying leap straight into the neck of his also small, but larger, rival.He then flattened another with an acrobatic headstand kick known as the Zero Gravity move.The audience went wild in Arena Mexico, the high cathedral of lucha libre.Did you see how he held that headstand on top of the ropes? He does it really well, said one impressed fan, 28-year-old construction worker Juan Carlos Elizalde.He\u0027s really tiny, but look how he fights! said another, 30-year-old Felipe Escorza.Microman, 19, takes it all in with an attitude befitting lucha libre\u0027s biggest little star.Microman meets his fansMicroman is a wrestler who gives everything he\u0027s got for the crowd, he said, referring to himself in the third person.Microman was fighting in the second match of the night - four bouts down from the top of the fight card.But just having his name on the billing shows the progress he and other little wrestlers have made since his father\u0027s time.Microman is the son of Kemonito, who was also a midget wrestler but had a very different career.For 30 years, Kemonito was a mascota for full-size wrestlers, a laughable sidekick who provided comic relief until the real action started.Working conditions and the level of respect have improved dramatically since then in the Mexican professional wrestling league, the World Lucha Libre Council (CMLL), says Catalina Gaspar, an activist for little people\u0027s rights.Microman (C) and Chamuel (L) take part in a training sessionThey train them professionally now. I\u0027ve been really happy to see that. Twenty years ago, they threw them in the ring with wrestlers who were two metres (more than 6\u00276) tall, and they got injured a lot, Ms Gaspar told AFP.Kemonito\u0027s generation had no health insurance or benefits, but put up with the job for lack of other options, she said.Some of them were paralysed...

Hence the cheering from the sadly limited number of people in Theresa May’s Britain that have sufficient spare cash to salt some away.\u0026nbspAnother point in the account’s favour is that it is a truly mass market product, available to anyone aged 18 and above with a minimum deposit of just £1.\u0026nbspSing it loud, sing it proud: Let’s go Goldman’s! Or should that be: Let’s go Marcus! \u0026nbsp“There is a real disillusionment about savings,” said Marcus MD Des McDaid. “We want to reverse the trend - literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Get you to Saville Row to have a pair of underpants fitted that you can wear above your suit Des! You’re the new savings Superman!\u0026nbsp“More competition in the savings market is sorely needed,” said Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform in response.\u0026nbspJust how true that statement is can been seen if you consider one of the numbers put out by Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s biggest retail bank.\u0026nbspNet interest margin is, in simple, terms the difference between what borrowers pay and what savers are paid. At Lloyds it hit a low of 1.91 per cent in the second quarter of 2012. In the early part of 2018, however, it had improved to a balmy 2.93 per cent.\u0026nbspNow the number encompasses\u0026nbspall of the various ways Lloyds funds its various lending activities (so corporate deposits, current accounts, wholesale funding etc). It isn’t limited to retail savings accounts and loans.\u0026nbspBut you don’t get to juice your margins like that when you’re operating in a vibrantly competitive savings market.\u0026nbspSo yay Goldman. Up to a point. Because you won\u0027t be surprised to learn that, this being banking, there is\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcatch.For a start, as Suter points out, the account pays\u0026nbspjust 0.09 per cent more than current table-topper Yorkshire Building Society, good for an extra 90p a year for someone with £1,000 on deposit. Some people might think it’s worth giving that up to save with a building society they own a piece of in preference to Goldman. ​Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The cars’n’cycles chain today unveiled a swanky new long term strategy designed to transform it into a “service led super specialist”.\u0026nbspIf that statement doesn’t qualify for a “crikey!” or even a “corky o’reilly!” I’m not sure what does.\u0026nbspBut there’s more. The retailer says it is preparing to offer a “differentiated, super specialist, shopping experience” that will “inspire and support a lifetime of motoring and cycling”. Wow! I’m not sure quite what that means but Wow!Halfords half-year profit knocked back by Brexit-hit poundHalfords posts solid sales thanks to UK staycation boom Cycle slump puts the brakes on Halfords’ growthThe thing is, it isn’t just mere hyperbole married to corporate gibberish. CEO Graham Stapleton has promised to put the company\u0027s money where his mouth is.\u0026nbspAs part of its “capital markets day” he announced plans to invest £20m a year on top of the existing £40m a year of capital expenditure Halfords had told its investors to expect.That part went down like a lead balloon in the City because analysts had to cut their profit forecasts. Shareholders will have to accept flat profits for a couple of years with only “mid single digit growth” after that.\u0026nbspYou have to sympathise with Mr Stapleton a bit. The world’s most successful companies get there by investing heavily in their businesses.\u0026nbspPart of the reason that Britain has so few among their number is that its top companies have a dismal record when it comes to doing that, and it’s partly because of the short termism that dominates in the City.\u0026nbspThe UK would arguably be in\u0026nbspbetter economic shape if a few more CEOs were willing to stand up to it by telling their investors that it takes money to make money.\u0026nbspHalfords won’t be in any sort of shape if it isn’t prepared to spend a bit on coping with a new reality that requires companies with bricks and mortar stores to offer more than they used to to tempt customers away from the web. That more is service. \u0026nbspBut you can also understand the City’s scepticism. This is Halfords, after all, and there aren’t many who would describe it as one of the world’s most successful businesses.\u0026nbspIt has spent too much time driving in the slow lane while cycling through CEOs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair - 89 per cent of people think it is wrong.

The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The group has seen profits shrink and struggled to shift stock in recent years due to competition from both those brands, as well as high-street rivals such as Primark. However, the company reassured investors on Thursday that it would not need to cut costs to move unsold clothing in spite of the quarterly dip in profit, and shares in H\u0026ampM rose more than 11 per cent. \u0026nbspThe fashion company’s CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said: “The rapid changes in the fashion industry are continuing and the H\u0026ampM group is in an exciting transitional period. Our transformation work has contributed to a gradual improvement in sales development with increased market share in most markets during the third quarter, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.Autistic boy becomes H\u0026ampM model after he was banned from school pictureH\u0026ampM is launching a lingerie collection with Love StoriesH\u0026ampM accused of failing to ensure fair wages for global factory workers“In the US, France, Italy and Belgium, however, store sales were negatively impacted by the problems that arose when we introduced new logistics systems in these markets. The new logistics systems are an essential part of our work to make our supply chain faster, more flexible and more efficient, and to continue the integration of stores and online.”As of May this year, H\u0026ampM had 4,801 stores in 69 countries and is looking to expand its reach even further.In its nine-month report, the company announced that Uruguay will become a new store market in Autumn 2018 and that contemporary fashion brand COS (part of the H\u0026ampM group) will launch online in China in Autumn 2018 as well.The fashion brand has also recently launched new brand Afound both in stores and online in Sweden. Meanwhile, the retailer is revamping its Swedish stores after being criticised for its cluttered environment. The company created a pilot store in Stockholm with a smaller range of clothes on show and an airier design, which features invitation-only events and where customers can order coffees while they shop. H\u0026ampM was recently accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair “living wage”.The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) said the group had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.However, the Swedish company said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.A spokeswoman for H\u0026ampM said: “There is no universally agreed level for living wages, and wage levels should be defined and set by parties on the labour market through fair negotiations between employers and workers representatives, not by Western brands.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sterling subsequently fell sharply after the unexpected result came in, netting large windfalls for those who correctly predicted the result.Remain would be ahead in fresh EU vote, new polls tracker suggestsNicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee, has written to British Polling Council president Sir John Curtice expressing concern that the sale of private polling data threatens to undermine the integrity of financial markets.The warning follows a report by Bloomberg on the sale of private data by YouGov, Survation and ICM prior to the Brexit vote.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage also came under scrutiny after he conceded defeat seconds after the polls closed in the referendum before the result was known, despite apparently being in possession of data which suggested the nation had voted to leave the EU. Mr Farage has previously worked as a commodity trader and currency broker.Funds paid many times in excess of the normal rate for polling in the run-up to the vote having seen the exchange rate movements after the Scottish Independence referendum and realising the profits that could be made.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that Leave was to emerge victorious.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury Committee, and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Ms Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It\u0027s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, whilst providing more accurate - and lucrative - analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients to make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals, they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair - 89 per cent of people think it is wrong. The CMA needs to act now to stop people being exploited,”\u0026nbspTalkTalk most complained-about broadband and landline providerBritain must get out of the slow lane when it comes to broadbandA\u0026nbsp super complaint \u0026nbspcan be made by any Government-designated consumer group in order to ask regulators to investigate an issue or practice working against the public interest.\u0026nbspThe CMA confirmed that it would investigate the complaint together with the Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom and would publish a response within 90 days.FCA ​chief executive Andrew Bailey said Citizens Advice had raised a number of important points.“We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing, he said.It is important to get the balance right so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products.\u0026nbsp“The general insurance market study we have announced today will help us examine the issues we have already identified in the market in more detail.”Richard Neudegg, head of regulations at uSwitch, said: “Citizens Advice is right to highlight that vulnerable consumers can often end up paying too much on their bills because there isn’t enough support from companies to ensure they get a fair deal.\u0026nbsp“While there are some schemes to financially support these customers in different sectors, these can be difficult to access and don’t have to be available through all providers.“As always, being switched on about the cost of your bills and taking action when companies’ offers aren’t good enough can lead to savings running into the £100s every year. The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The group has seen profits shrink and struggled to shift stock in recent years due to competition from both those brands, as well as high-street rivals such as Primark. However, the company reassured investors on Thursday that it would not need to cut costs to move unsold clothing in spite of the quarterly dip in profit, and shares in H\u0026ampM rose more than 11 per cent. \u0026nbspThe fashion company’s CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said: “The rapid changes in the fashion industry are continuing and the H\u0026ampM group is in an exciting transitional period. Our transformation work has contributed to a gradual improvement in sales development with increased market share in most markets during the third quarter, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.Autistic boy becomes H\u0026ampM model after he was banned from school pictureH\u0026ampM is launching a lingerie collection with Love StoriesH\u0026ampM accused of failing to ensure fair wages for global factory workers“In the US, France, Italy and Belgium, however, store sales were negatively impacted by the problems that arose when we introduced new logistics systems in these markets. The new logistics systems are an essential part of our work to make our supply chain faster, more flexible and more efficient, and to continue the integration of stores and online.”As of May this year, H\u0026ampM had 4,801 stores in 69 countries and is looking to expand its reach even further.In its nine-month report, the company announced that Uruguay will become a new store market in Autumn 2018 and that contemporary fashion brand COS (part of the H\u0026ampM group) will launch online in China in Autumn 2018 as well.The fashion brand has also recently launched new brand Afound both in stores and online in Sweden. Meanwhile, the retailer is revamping its Swedish stores after being criticised for its cluttered environment. The company created a pilot store in Stockholm with a smaller range of clothes on show and an airier design, which features invitation-only events and where customers can order coffees while they shop. H\u0026ampM was recently accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair “living wage”.The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) said the group had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.However, the Swedish company said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.A spokeswoman for H\u0026ampM said: “There is no universally agreed level for living wages, and wage levels should be defined and set by parties on the labour market through fair negotiations between employers and workers representatives, not by Western brands.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It was first broadcast by the BBC on 16 September 1981, running for 196 episodes through the 1980s and 1990s.\u0026nbspFollowing a hiatus, Postman Pat was revived in 2003 before a film followed in 2014, with Stephen Mangan replacing Ken Barrie as the voice of Pat.Reflecting on Pat’s creation in 2011, Cunliffe remembered approaching the BBC with a collection of farmer characters. When these were rejected, he was forced to return to the drawing board.“Who else lives in the countryside?” he asked himself. “Well, a postman travels around, he meets a lot of people, so it won’t be static, there’ll be all that movement and getting to know people and a friendly character.”Encouraged to pursue the thread, he was sent back to Kendal to write an outline for 13 episodes.“When I wrote it, I didn’t know it was going to be animated. They said:\u0026nbsp‘Just write stories. Don’t worry how we’re doing it. You just write stories.’ So I did.”“The important thing, I think\u0026nbspthe editor at my publishers said, is that for once they’ve asked a writer to write a series and they haven’t interfered because they produced it exactly as I wrote it.”Cunliffe had been a mobile librarian in Northumberland at an earlier stage of his life and drew on those experiences of driving from village to village for his cast of characters, from Mrs Goggins to Ted Glen and the Reverend Timms.“I travelled around very much as Pat travels around... a lot of that fed into it,” he said.Born in Colne, Lincolnshire, Cunliffe had been bullied at school by older boys so wanted to offer a comforting, harmonious vision of the world through his idyllic depiction of Greendale, specifically based on the valley of Longsleddale.Jess the black and white cat, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp“provided Pat with someone to speak to without seeming too peculiar”.How Mister Rogers saved children\u0027s TV from Richard NixonCunliffe did, however, become exasperated with the commercialisation of Pat, feeling the merchandising had become excessive and often shoddy.In response, he created Rosie and Jim for CITV, over which he retained total control.\u0026nbspThe adventures of a pair of living ragdolls meandering through the canals of the British countryside by narrowboat, the programme featured Cunliffe himself as the Dickensianly-named boat owner Fizzgog, who would write stories about Rosie and Jim and often speak directly to camera.His local paper, the Ilkey Gazette, paid moving tribute to the late author and poet in its obituary this week: “John Cunliffe left his Ilkley home in a deluge of rain on 20 September, never to return. Even the skies wept for John.”Rosie and JimShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Never mind either, that it has provided employment to thousands of broadcast professionals and forced other media outlets to up their game. And never mind that the advent of subscription TV has, in turn, pumped vast amounts of money back into football and other sports.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Indeed, for Murdoch’s critics (haters, in some cases), the success of Sky is somehow a further reason to knock him. Opponents perceive in Sky News the political bias that is obvious – and permissible – in Murdoch’s newspaper empire, although there is no real evidence to back the claim. What’s more, the issue of paying to watch sport remains inherently isive: would interest in cricket have declined in the last decade or so if the masses could still watch it on Channel 4 or the BBC?Whatever your view on Murdoch, however, the prospect of him no longer having any stake in Sky – which he launched in 1989 – feels momentous. Few might have guessed nearly three decades ago that the subscription broadcaster would become the monolith that it is today. The auction for control of the company, won by Comcast on Saturday, valued Sky at £30bn – which is enough for a lot of satellite dishes.As such, even if UK-based TV could never provide a platform for political rhetoric in the way that a newspaper can, Murdoch’s influence in the wider media industry will be weakened by his exit from Sky.Nevertheless, it would be premature to conclude that we’ve seen the last of him. Murdoch may be 89-years-old but there is little to suggest he is any less engaged with his businesses – and especially with his newspapers – than in previous times. What’s more, without Sky to worry about, this titan of media titans may feel he can devote his entire focus to the elements of his empire which remain. For those in senior editorial roles at The Sun in particular, that may be quite a thought.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopWe are at present six months away from Brexit (in theory), with debate about our mode of departure (and a possible second referendum) raging. Murdoch’s view on that issue seems fairly clear as does his position on the potential of Jeremy Corbyn forming a new government.The influence of inidual newspaper on elections and on major policy issues is debatable. But, with Sky behind him, Murdoch may believe the time has come to once again turn up the heat from The Sun.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sterling subsequently fell sharply after the unexpected result came in, netting large windfalls for those who correctly predicted the result.Remain would be ahead in fresh EU vote, new polls tracker suggestsNicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee, has written to British Polling Council president Sir John Curtice expressing concern that the sale of private polling data threatens to undermine the integrity of financial markets.The warning follows a report by Bloomberg on the sale of private data by YouGov, Survation and ICM prior to the Brexit vote.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage also came under scrutiny after he conceded defeat seconds after the polls closed in the referendum before the result was known, despite apparently being in possession of data which suggested the nation had voted to leave the EU. Mr Farage has previously worked as a commodity trader and currency broker.Funds paid many times in excess of the normal rate for polling in the run-up to the vote having seen the exchange rate movements after the Scottish Independence referendum and realising the profits that could be made.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that Leave was to emerge victorious.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury Committee, and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Ms Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It\u0027s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, whilst providing more accurate - and lucrative - analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients to make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals, they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Speaking to reporters outside the organisation’s Berlaymont headquarters he said Labour was “not negotiating” with the EU.We’re obviously not negotiating, we’re not in government“We’re obviously not negotiating, we’re not in government, we’re the opposition, but it was interesting to note what our views are and the six tests that we’ve laid down by which we will hold our government to account in the future,” he said.He added: “We set out the views of the Labour party on issues surrounding Brexit following the conferences speeches made by both Keir Starmer and myself.”But the meetings come just 24 hours after he told Theresa May that if she could not reach a deal with Brussels, Labour would step in.Ahead of the meeting a spokesperson for the European Commission said he was not aware whether Mr Selmayr would be meeting with Mr Corbyn.\u0026nbspAsked whether he was scared of Mr Selamyr, European Commission chief spokesperson Margaritas Schinas says: “Martin is a friend for many years and we have a relation that goes beyond fear, hope… it’s respect, to each other.”Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The paper tracked down residents of the village where Colonel\u0026nbspAnatoliy\u0026nbspChepiga\u0026nbspapparently spent much of his youth. Locals said they recognised “Tolya” (short form of\u0026nbspAnatoliy) in the UK police photos and much-ridiculed RT interview. \u0026nbsp“Many people look like one another”“It’s\u0026nbspTolya, one hundred percent. His near-black eyes, and his voice,” said one woman, who refused to be identified.\u0026nbspWhen the Kremlin eventually broke cover on Thursday evening, it was to deny knowledge of anything to do with the\u0026nbspGRU\u0026nbspcolonel.\u0026nbspIn a tense session with journalists, spokesman\u0026nbspDmitry\u0026nbspPeskov\u0026nbspsaid he did “not have the information” to confirm or deny the man that UK police identified as\u0026nbspRuslan\u0026nbspBoshriov\u0026nbspwas, indeed, Colonel\u0026nbspAnatoliy\u0026nbspChepiga.\u0026nbsp“We don’t have any other data,” he said. “We see there has been an informal investigation. We don’t know if it is true, or how much it is true.”\u0026nbspBesides, he added, “many people look like one another.”novichok poisoning caseMr\u0026nbspPeskov\u0026nbspclaimed to have only come across the information when the report was published on Wednesday. He could not confirm why a military officer by the name of\u0026nbspChepiga\u0026nbspreceived Russia’s highest military award.The spokesman indicated the Kremlin had little interest in a comprehensive discussion of the subject. After speaking out in defence of “two ordinary civilians”, the president is also unlikely to voluntarily return to the issue.\u0026nbsp“Putin understands it was an egregious mistake of information policy to speak in the way that he did,” says former Kremlin advisor\u0026nbspGleb\u0026nbspPavlovsky. The president’s ill-advised intervention had only fuelled the scandal: “Before there was only Theresa May speaking. Putin voluntarily offered up a protocol equivalent.”Mr Pavlovsky suggests the Russian president had been motivated by an “elevated sense of self-worth”, and a belief his words would be enough to change things.\u0026nbsp“He will not be making the same mistake again,” says Mr Pavlovsky.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspsystem strives to escalation and radicalisation. It answers escalation with escalation.” \u0026nbspThe scale of the intelligence blunders is likely to have wide-reaching\u0026nbspconsequences for Russia’s intelligence services. A shake-up in personnel seems inevitable. This is unlikely to happen immediately, however. Mr Putin’s HR policy is usually conservative and detached from news events.\u0026nbspBut when it happens, things could get ugly, says Alexei Filatov, a retired lieutenant colonel of Russia\u0027s\u0026nbspsecurity\u0026nbspservices.\u0026nbsp“If it turns out to be as the investigation says it was, then lord help us, honours will be flying off people’s uniforms, and people will be fired,” he told The Independent. “It would be a shame since the\u0026nbspGRU\u0026nbspis a decorated institution with a great history.”\u0026nbspMr Filatov said he could not confirm the veracity of the\u0026nbspBellingcatInsider report. Nonetheless, their conclusions “looked more convincing and well argued than those presented by our Foreign Ministry”.\u0026nbspThe former agent says Russia’s intelligence agencies may also been undone by technological advance: “It is like a mine – we’re discovering new layers of information that previously people thought didn’t exist. It may be impossible to hide all the information.”\u0026nbspBut as embarrassing as the leaks have been, they are unlikely to lead to a root-and-branch reform of the political system.\u0026nbspIf anything, radical politicians will feed off the scandal, says Mr Pavlovsky.\u0026nbsp“I’m afraid our leaders like it when the west writes terrible things about them,” he says. “The\u0026nbspsystem strives to escalation and radicalisation. It answers escalation with escalation.” \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

scenario on the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM).They have suggested there are risks of price increases and supply shortages.Most experts have considered the SEM to be a relatively unproblematic part of Brexit because it is a UK-Ireland bilateral arrangement, rather than an EU arrangement.But it is underpinned by the UK and Ireland\u0027s membership of the Internal Energy Market (IEM), participation of which requires alignment with EU rules including industrial emissions regulations and restrictions on state aid.Jeremy Corbyn is meeting Michel Barnier and Martin Selmayr

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum this has always been rejected by Downing Street.In September 2018 the mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham backed a second Brexit vote  there was a no-deal scenario - but warned it could trigger social unrest.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Theresa May called on Jeremy Corbyn to rule out a second vote on EU membership during PMQs, but the Labour leader failed to respond.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.Later in September 2018, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.”Party bosses have hinted theyll back a second referendum - but Jeremy Corbyns closest ally, John McDonnell, has ruled out keeping Britain in the EU.Labour bigwigs set out a new policy which could see the party supporting a fresh referendum  Theresa May refuses to call a General Election.But the policy was blown apart just hours later when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested the second referendum wouldnt include an option to remain in the EU.Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, the hard-left veteran said: “We’ve said we want a people’s vote  we can’t get a General Election.“We accept the last referendum - we want a General Election,  we can’t get that we want some form of democratic option.”Asked what form a second referendum would take, Mr McDonnell said: “It will be on the deal itself. We will respect the referendum.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Following John McDonnells comments, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer reaffirmed that the party have not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendum.Ahead of a vote at the party conference on Tuesday, September 25, the shadow Brexit secretary said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.Starmer told the party conference: We want a General Election to sweep away this failed government.He added: And having swept them away we want to install a radical Labour government capable of transforming this country. And thats what should happen after two years of negotiations ending in failure.But  thats not poss we must have other options, and that must include campaigning for a public vote.Starmer said: No one is ruling out remain as an option.Paddy Power has odds of 2/1 on another EU referendum before the end of 2019.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed 59 per cent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while 41 per cent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview panel was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.  The first referendum on EU membership took place in 1975.Two-thirds of voters  backed the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in 1993.In the summer of 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU after 17.4million people backed Leave compared to 16.1million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the

takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

This, he insisted, would remain free under Labour — but not just to print what it liked. Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government. Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded. And he is the “next Secretary of State for Justice”, God help us.Corbyn is keen to rebrand his extremism as mainstream in an era when capitalism has “failed”. It is, in reality, a dog-eared hard-left roadmap to ruin on a scale we have never experienced.A Britain which would kill ambition and enterprise and drive out successful firms by stealing their property. Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable. Socialism is the last thing we need. Next to last are Tory “Corbyn-lite” tax rises.Record job figures, low inflation and interest rates add up to a society and economy far healthier than the dystopia of chippy Corbynite imaginations.But  the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.WELL done to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson for swtly ensuring the kids of dying RAF officer Samantha McConnell will not be denied her pension.Now he must change the rules for good.So others like her get the same deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a pair of gay males who had snatched it and was stood with it.”Sandie said she believed the mum had gone for her daily bath and when she did not  in time for the dad appeared to have forgotten all about his parental responsibilities and left the baby alone.She added: “When they saw him alone they probably thought ‘that’s too bad, we’ll snatch it.It was thought the mum and dad would  and claim their chick back, but that did not immediately happen.  Eventually they did come looking for it and it was decided to give them custody of the bird.Seemingly scandalised by the sight, the Edwardian scientist described the behaviour as depraved. More recently the behaviour has been observed in a number of zoos. In 2014 Jumbs and Hurricane, two Humboldt penguins at Wingham Wildle Park in Kent became inseparable and became celebrities in their own right.They later successfully hatched and reared an egg given to them as surrogate parents after the mum abandoned it halfway through incubation.At first the flightless, two-toned fellas got in a flap about giving up their adopted child without a fight, but Sandie said with a heavy heart they eventually let go.But while this may pull at heartstrings, there is a happy ending to the story because the zookeepers, after seeing how they cared for the baby, have decided to give them an egg from a new mum who was unable to look after her offspring because of illness."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431336217-e1536264401854.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum baby decapitated botched birth doctor said ive fixed him","story":"Laura Gallazzi was 25 weeks pregnant when she went into labour, with a top NHS doctor pulling the babys legs during the birth.But the babys head was detached from his body during the horric delivery, with his head still left in his mothers womb.The first-time mum was then forced to undergo a C-section to remove the head - which was sewn back on to the tragic tots body so she could hold him and say goodbye.Cradling the plush bear that holds her sons ashes, the mum revealed to BBC Radio Scotland her terror at seeing her sons body, unsure what she would be confronted with.She said: I thought I dont want to see him, dont bring him in here, because I didnt know what I was going to be looking at.The doctor said its alright. Her words were Ive fixed him.Since a tribunal into the 2014 delivery at Dundees Ninewells hospital in Dundee, Scotland, Laura has spoken out of how she could not forgive the consultant gynaecologist, Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, for Stevens death.The investigation found that while Dr Laxmans decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery instead of a C-section was a mistake, the medic was cleared to  to work.Traumatised Laura, 34, earlier told The Sun: She butchered my son. How could this happen in this day and age?”Only three babies in the world are known to have succumbed to such a sickening fate and Laura said: It’s like something from medieval times. I never imagined this would be my experience of birth.”Dr Laxman admitted she had tried “too hard” to deliver the tot and the tribunal said she had been wrong not to carry out the initial C-section. But it ruled the senior gynaecologist had been working in the “best interests” of the mum, and that she posed “no risk to patient safety”.The ordeal has taken a huge toll on haunted Laura who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder.The mum now keeps Stevens ashes in a teddy so she can have him with her — and on her forearm has tattoo prints of his hands and feet as well as the roman numerals of the year he was born.She says: “Even though I wasn’t ever able to hold him, I can carry him with me wherever I go now. Where I go, the teddy goes. I draw enormous comfort from it and would be lost without it.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437382573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn michel barnier brussels brexit","story":"The Labour leaders aide had to make an urgent appeal for cash after realising no one was able to pay for the cab in Brussels this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was left waiting outside EU headquarters as his staff had a whip-round - and risked being late for his meeting with top eurocrat Michel Barnier.He told Mr Barnier, the EUs Brexit envoy, that Britain cant quit the EU without a trade deal lined up.The talks are a fresh bid to undermine the official Brexit negotiations being carried out by Theresa May.Mr Corbyn drew up at the office of the European Commission in a taxi with Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.But the driver apparently refused to go in to the buildings vehicle entrance until he was paid - and he didnt accept cards.A Labour aide was heard asking, Does anyone have any euros?Mr Corbyns right-hand man Seumas Milne laughed as another aide stepped in to provide the money needed.Labours fresh attempt to sideline Mrs May in Brussels comes after Labour opened the door to a second referendum on Brexit at their party conference this week.Mr Corbyn took Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer with him on the trip to Brussels today.Speaking after the meting, he said: Weve had an interesting, useful discussion with Mr Barnier.We have set out the views of the Labour Party surrounding Brexit following the conference speeches made by Keir Starmer and myself.We are obviously not negotiating.

Attacking Labour and proclaiming our sound economic management is necessary but not sufficient.“I can’t help thinking we have lost our way. Disconcerted by a sht in the zeitgeist against business, and by the cumulative surprises of the financial crisis, the EU referendum and the 2017 general election, we appear to have become confused about how to handle business.“We are at our best when we are pro-enterprise and pro-endeavour, and when we do this in a way that is clear that our motive is to make the world a better place and improve the lot of ordinary citizens.“To succeed we need to offer a compelling alternative vision that the next generation can buy into.“We can’t out-Corbyn Corbyn, and  we try, we risk offering a pale imitation that leaves people yearning for the real thing.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there are options on the table to get out of this mess.“As the numbers show, instead of pumping more cash into failed ideas like Help to Buy, we should be building much more social housing to give hard-pressed families an alternative to the private rented sector.“Not only would this be a massive stride towards ending this crisis, but it’d be wildly popular too – so let’s get on with it.”Between 2001 and 2018 the size of the private rental sector doubled, from 11% of the adult population to 28%.The same period also saw a marked decline in the number who own their own home, falling from 73% of the population to 59%.The Tories are consumed by Brexit. But away from that they must wake up and present radical ideas to beat ­Corbyn’s, especially on housing.They have an advantage.Theirs are more likely to be sane.And vanishingly less likely to put hundreds of thousands on the dole.But Theresa May must realise that voters have more pressing problems than Brexit which could cost her power.Next week the Tories must have a new story to tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Hatton, former deputy leader of Liverpool\u0027s City Council, was expelled for belonging to the left-wing Militant faction. He caused national outcry in the 1980s by setting an illegal budget and was denounced for sending redundancy notices by taxi to thousands of council workers. He and other members of Trotskyite group known as the Militant Tendency were widely blamed for making the party unelectable during Mr Kinnock\u0027s tenure. The 70-year-old former poster boy of the hard left has said he was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s leadership to reapply for membership. Despite Mr Hatton telling the Liverpool Echo he has rejoined the party, it is understood he is not currently a member. However, it is thought party chiefs are not aware of anything in Labour rules that will bar him from rejoining.   Just days ago a shadow cabinet minister, Jon Ashworth, dismissed reports Mr Hatton could rejoin saying: He does this all the time, doesn\u0027t he? He\u0027s not going to join the Labour Party. He just does this for publicity. Writing in the Echo, Mr Hatton said he spent much of the last 33 years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular at Tony Blair\u0027s decision to invade Iraq. However, he said he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and this week\u0027s Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock booted Mr Hatton out of the party after giving one of the most famous conference speeches in history. The 1985 address declaring war on Militant was hailed by Mr Kinnock\u0027s supporters as the turning point in the battle to purge the hard left from Labour. Mr Kinnock told the party faithful: “I’ll tell you what happens with impossible promises. You start with far-fetched resolutions.  They are then pickled into a rigid dogma, a code, and you go through the years sticking to that, out-dated, mis-placed, irrelevant to the real needs, and you end in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council – a Labour council! - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers. As he spoke, Mr Hatton shouted: Liar! This week, Mr Hatton hailed a sea change under unswerving socialist Mr Corbyn - saying he never dreamed a backer of mass nationalisation would lead the Labour Party.  [His] leader’s speech made me say something I never thought I’d say: We have a ‘socialist Prime Minister in waiting’, he said.  He also hit out over the party\u0027s anti-Semitism row, saying it was disgraceful that Chuka Umunna called Labour institutionally racist.  He wrote: In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics. Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.

Or they didn’t want to take food from the children.” MYA’s response was to develop its own service for young people aged 16-25. This week, I took one of those young people – Stacey Bridge – to the Labour conference to speak alongside our other guests, including her childhood hero, the former Everton goalkeeping legend Neville Southall. Over 250 people came to hear them. “The first day I went to the foodbank I thought it would be really horrible,” says Stacey, who now volunteers at MYA and is enrolled in one of its youth programmes. I expected to be really embarrassed and they’d just give you a bag of food. It’s the opposite. You get so much help and support. When I left I actually felt really good.”  Stacey, now 26, had been left homeless after struggling to pay for her dad’s funeral following his murder. “We were down to a bottle of juice and half a loaf of bread when we came in. I was living in a hostel with my partner who was on a low wage working as a chef.” Before that she’d had several nights at a ‘sit up’ service, where there are no beds provided. Stacey now helps at the foodbank where “you see young people come in and their shoes are falling off them”, she says. “You can tell how hungry they are.” I first met Stacey a few weeks ago in Liverpool, and asked her  she’d come to speak at Labour conference – joining Amina Weston, a young woman who was \u0026shyillegally evicted when she was pregnant, and Southall, who now works with excluded kids. I wanted them to remind the conference that every day without a change in government is a lost day for millions of young people. It’s another day hungry. Another day homeless. Another day of a baby brought up in bed and breakfast. Amina, from Leeds, who I met through our Wigan Pier Project, read a poem at our fringe meeting that left some delegates, including Unite leader Len McCluskey, in tears.  “Bedroom floors, sofas, dispersed hostels and bidding numbers,” she read. “What a le for a little baby.” Homelessness meant Amina was forced to give up on her third year of university. Yet she has still gone on to set up a school unorm project with her sister to help struggling families. “It makes you realise what we’re about,” McCluskey said. “We’re about fighting for fairness, for decency, for justice for all people.” Neville Southall spoke about desperately trying to get help for his foster sons and for the excluded kids he now works with. “The education system is a nightmare at the moment,” he said. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell praised our Wigan Pier Project and said that George Orwell had taught in his constituency. The 1984 author had been senior master at the former Hawthorns High School for Boys in the early 1930s, before he left for Wigan.  “If George Orwell came back to my constituency today, he’d find families living in beds in sheds and garages,” McDonnell said in a blistering speech. “We’ve got people living in vans and cars. We’ve reinvented the back-to-back in my constituency – where one family lives in the rear of the property and one in the front. “We’ve got people sleeping in our parks, along the canal and under bridges on a scale we’ve not seen before. Five thousand of our fellow \u0026shycitizens are out there sleeping on the streets tonight. That’s a bloody disgrace in the sixth richest country in the world. “If George Orwell came back today he’d know what zero-hours was like. Because on these docks just down here my dad and my granddad used to line up in the street in the 1930s and they’d be pointed at  they’d got work and  they didn’t they’d be sent home. “That’s what’s happening with zero-hour contracts given to our kids in 2018.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyns economic medicine looks","story":"NewsopinionJeremy Corbyn\u0027s economic medicine looks increasingly attractiveThe Labour leader promised to transform a country still reeling from the financial crash.

This was an address to a country which is still suffering ten years after the financial crash. His plans are bold but his pitch was simple: only Labour has the policies which will mend the damage caused by the banking crisis and the subsequent Tory austerity. Labour, he declared, is now the new majority whose ideas have caught the mood of the time. Much of the speech was directed to those areas which voted Leave in the Brexit referendum.  Corbyn made clear he understood their motives and stood ready to help them rebuild their communities. “There will be no more left behind areas,” he said. Yet this speech was an acknowledgement that his party must do more to persuade voters it was fit to govern. First, there was an appeal to the Labour rank and file to show more unity. Divided and hate-filled parties will not win elections. Secondly, he looked to reassure people that while his agenda was radical it was also common sense. Like a kindly doctor speaking to a patient before an operation, he tried to convince them the procedure may be pioneering but was in their best interests.

The Department for Communities and Local Government received a request under freedom of information laws two years ago asking how regularly James Wharton travelled outside London. The Government flouted a requirement to respond to the request within 20 working days and did not provide a response for more than four months - at which point it denied the application. The Information Commissioner’s Office subsequently launched a probe and found the Government adopted a strategy of “wilful procrastination in order to obstruct a request for information”. The DCLG appealed against the decision to the first-tier tribunal of information rights, where in early 2018 Judge Hazel Oliver ruled that the department must hand over Wharton’s diary.  The whole process took 26 months. The information - diary entries between January and April 2016 - that the Government sought to suppress for two years shows that Mr Wharton rarely left London as part of his ministerial role as the North’s representative. Of the 693 lines of entries in his ministerial diary, half have office details or identiable addresses in the “Location” column, of which 90% of them are in London. Just 28 relate to a meeting or event in the North. Mr Wharton was a Tory MP for Stockton South until he lost his seat in 2017. The Government fought for so long to prevent the release of the information that two other men, Andrew Percy and Jake Berry, have since taken up the role of Northern Powerhouse minister, and the entire department has been renamed as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.  Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a Manchester-based think tank, said: “It is of course disappointing that the minister charged with the Northern Powerhouse spent so little time in the area getting to understand what’s important to the people, communities and businesses of the north. “But the attempts to thwart access to information about the work of the northern Powerhouse minister show a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability. “The Government need to use this as an opportunity to build a much more robust system of transparency and accountability, so that voters in the north can have confidence that the government are really serious and committed to supporting northern leaders to build a better future for the north.” Legal experts also slammed the Government.

Ryan Smith told girlfriend Laura McKay he had made her a good one this year and was excited for the card to be delivered. But when it arrived, a gobsmacked Laura immediately noticed he had made the worst possible mistake - by getting her name wrong. The card, which had a collage of lovely photographs of the couple on the front, read: Make today amazing! Happy birthday Georgia. Laura said: Every year he books a night away somewhere and writes where we’re going in the card but the past two years he’s just told me where he’s booked because the card is always late.  So the weekend before my birthday he’s banging on about this card and how much of a ‘good one’ it is this year. Don’t get me wrong, the pictures he’s picked are my favourite ones of us so I can see why he was excited to give me it. So he hands me it in the same envelope that it got delivered to his house in – even though it comes with two as you’re meant to open it, CHECK IT and put it in a fresh envelope. Might I add when it got delivered to his house, his mum said to him maybe you should check it but he was adamant it was perfect.   Laura posted the amusing gaffe on Twitter - and she sounded a bit upset about it.  She wrote: Right SO Ryan’s just came in with my birthday card  and he’s been concentrating so hard on the f***ing pictures the c**ts forgot to CHANGE the writing. Who the F*** is Georgia? To Laura\u0027s surprise, the tweet was shared thousands of times.  But even though she got a bit sweary, she wasn\u0027t actually upset about the mistake - and even saw the funny side. He does try his best with absolutely everything but sometimes his lack of common sense gets in the way, she said.  This is the most \u0027him\u0027 thing possible. He was so excited to give me the card and it was just so funny because he tried so hard. I couldn’t even be angry at him.

Daniel and Gemma Cullen, from Rhondda in Wales believe their daughter Caoimhe may have autism and say she is waiting for a formal diagnosis. The pair say she was excluded more than 10 times in just over a year at Tylorstown Primary in Rhonnda Cynon Taf between April 2017 and July 2018, reports Wales Online . The disruption meant Gemma had to leave her job at a nursery. Now in her second year at school, Caoimhe attends one day a week and spends the other four days a week at a special educational needs class at Cwm Clydach Primary. Calling for better understanding of autism and possible autism among teachers and schools, Gemma said Caoimhe has never been allowed to take part in a school play and has been kept indoors at play-time at Tylorstown Primary. “She was suspended around times of school trips or extra curricular activities and during the National Tests,” said Gemma.  “She has had two five-day suspensions for kicking someone and has had three day suspensions and half day suspensions here and there. “We think she has autism, it is some sort of additional needs, but she is still a baby.” Daniel, 32, and Gemma, 29, say she has not yet had a statement of special educational needs, although they believe she has autism and/or other SENs. “We pushed and pushed for an educational psychologist evaluation which concluded that Caoimhe has a lot of autistic traits and is seriously sensory overwhelmed  in school where she can’t cope and recommended four day placement in a dferent, calmer setting,” her mum said. “We have contacted the GP and health visitor for referral to the neurodevelopment team [at hospital in Merthyr] and are still on the waiting list for an appointment. I would like some sort of help. “This has been so disruptive I had to leave my job because the school were phoning me every day to come and get her. I was a senior educator in a nursery, in Porth.” Gemma said she filed a complaint to the pupil discipline and exclusions committee of the governing body of Tylorstown Primary School after her daughter was excluded for five days last term. The committee, in July, upheld that exclusion but found procedures were not followed for one exclusion in 2017.  In a letter to her, dated July 10 this year, a support officer for the governors said: ”The committee considered the decision made by Mrs Tuck to exclude your daughter Caoimhe, for a five day period on 15th June 2018 and, after carefully considering the representations made and all the available evidence, have decided to uphold this exclusion. “The reasons for the committee’s decision are as follows: Members felt that the exclusion was warranted due to the fact that it was in response to serious breaches of the school’s behaviour policy and by allowing Caoimhe to stay in school would seriously harm the education/welfare of her or others in the school. “The Committee will investigate the information you were given as there seems to be some discrepancy with that and advice provided to the headteacher... “...In relation to the alleged unlawful exclusion in October 2017  governors agree that the guidance was not followed. This was acknowledged by the headteacher at the meeting.” The letter goes on to say: “The committee felt the support and level of graduated response that has been put in place by the school over a long period of time for Caoimhe and, plans for her future via a four day placement in the Nurture Class in Cwmclydach Primary School were sufficient, and hope that she settles in well. Because the five-day exclusion in June was a fixed term exclusion of less than 15 days, the Cullens were told they had no right of appeal against it. Meleri Thomas, from National Autistic Society Cymru , said: Around 1 in 100 children are on the autism spectrum. Every autistic child is dferent but many become overwhelmed in school – by the bright lights, loud noises or other children\u0027s unpredictable behaviour. This can result in autistic pupils behaving in ways that seem naughty or disruptive to others when actually they are overwhelmed or distressed. And they can end up being unfairly excluded.

With palaces to live in, plenty of money in the bank and a platform to make a real dference to those in need, it\u0027s dficult to comprehend what more members of the royal family could possibly need.   But it turns out that there\u0027s one thing the Duchess of Cambridge is really keen to have - and it\u0027s something most parents will be able to relate to.    Prince William is currently on a solo trip to Africa and on Tuesday night  he attended the British High Commissioner\u0027s reception in Namibia.  During the event the Duke of Cambridge gave a speech to other guests where he revealed that he was getting to do something this week that his we wasn\u0027t - and she was immensely jealous of it. So what was it that the Duchess was so jealous of? The fact that her husband was enjoying several nights of peaceful sleep away from the kids.    William said: I’m delighted to be visiting Namibia for the first time. I’m only sorry that my we, Catherine, is not able to join me. She is immensely jealous. Particularly because I’m looking forward to a few good, uninterrupted nights’ sleep this week away from my wonderful children. Yesterday it was revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s maternity leave would soon be coming to an end as Kensington Palace announced her first official engagement since giving birth in April will take place next week.

Stacey Coulthard, 38, had visited a pal and had several drinks before walking home with son Kain Elden in the early hours of the morning. After a bite to eat, Kain went up to bed - but he was awoken by a concerned phone call from one of Stacey\u0027s friends, the hearing was told. He then discovered his mum\u0027s body and alerted emergency services. A post-mortem examination confirmed caring Stacey had died from aspyhxia due to strangulation, with the alcohol she had consumed that night being a contributory factor, StokeonTrent Live reports.  The inquest heard the last contact her own mum, Carol Thompson, had with her was a worrying text message hours before her body was found. The assistant coroner concluded her death was a result of suicide. Stacey, a care home support worker had ‘just got on with it’ whenever she encountered fresh challenges in her le, the hearing was told. But the final turning point came after she was injured at work, which left her with shoulder and neck pains and in need of surgery. She had to take time off to recover from the operation and this led to problems in accessing housing benefit and paying her council rent. By the time she died, she owed thousands of pounds from ious debts. The mum-of-three\u0027s body was found at her home in Mollison Road in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on December 9 last year. The hearing was told she had been visiting a friend the previous evening and had seemed in good spirits. She also had several drinks before walking home with Kain at around 2am, it was said.  Kain said they then had a bite to eat and his mum decided to sleep downstairs. He set up the settee for her and went up to bed himself. However, after being awoken by a phone call from one of her pals, he went downstairs, found her body and alerted the emergency services. The former Newstead Primary and Blurton High pupil had been known as a popular and friendly person, whose talents in sport had shone through during her school days. But when she was around 20 years old, Stacey had been a passenger in a car involved in a motorway pile-up. She suffered a brain injury that led to long-term problems with depression and anxiety, the inquest heard. Mrs Thompson said: “She lost all her childhood memories. She never got them back.” But she described how her daughter had always ‘battled through, no matter what’ and had been determined to keep on working. She had never previously expressed suicidal thoughts, although she was on medication and had received counselling.

Little Martha Taggart lives in a silent world and cannot communicate, has the mental age of a toddler and walks with slightly jerky movements, like a marionette. The smiling, sweet-natured youngster was born with a rare incurable neuro-genetic disorder - officially called Angelman syndrome. Her parents became concerned something was not quite right when she made no noises as a baby, so took her for tests and she was diagnosed with the condition.  Father Lee, 40, who lives with his we Charmaine, 39, Martha and her siblings, Solomon, three, and Norah, two, in Maidstone, Kent, said: I have come to terms with the condition and how it affects Martha. But, sometimes, I will have a little moment to myself when I think about what it will mean for her future. All the things that you take for granted in a person\u0027s le - like passing a driving test, going to university and falling in love - she will never get to do. And speaking selfishly, what makes me really upset is the idea that I will never get to walk her up the aisle.  People with what was originally dubbed happy puppet syndrome before being officially named Angelman syndrome in 1965, frequently laugh and smile, are restless and excitable, have a short attention span and a tendency to stick their tongues out. Fortunately, the jerking movements, characteristic of the condition are not pronounced in Martha\u0027s case, but she expresses herself solely through gestures and noises. Statistical programmer Charmaine explained: If she wants something she will take your hand and lead you there - take you to the fridge  she\u0027s hungry, or to the toilet  she needs the loo. Sometimes, though, she needs words and can\u0027t explain herself and I know that makes her very frustrated. But for the most part, she\u0027s a very joyful little girl. The name \u0027happy puppet\u0027 is outdated but really does ring true because she is always laughing and smiling - just not speaking.  The couple first suspected something might be wrong with Martha as a baby, as she rarely made any noise. She didn\u0027t babble or murmur in the way that babies do, recalled Charmaine, who met her husband at a nightclub in Southampton in 2005, marrying four years later. We took her for tests, but they were inconclusive. It wasn\u0027t until she was two and we had DNA testing that we discovered she had this rare genetic disorder called Angelman. It was a devastating blow for Charmaine and Lee, who had never heard of the condition, but were told it normally occurs by chance around the time of conception and those afflicted have a near normal le expectancy. In Martha\u0027s case, the impact of the syndrome has become more noticeable with age. Attending a special school for children with learning disabilities, she can become anxious in social situations, although she gets on well with her two younger siblings, neither of whom have Angelman.  Charmaine continued: All our children play very nicely together and get on very well. But the younger two are now beginning to talk and I think they are quite confused about why their older sister can\u0027t talk back to them. Although she has a cheery disposition for the most part, Martha\u0027s inability to communicate can make her frustrated, causing her to chew her clothes and pull her hair. You can see that it gets Martha worked up, and it\u0027s moments like that, when she can\u0027t speak to her siblings, that I feel most sorry for her. It\u0027s like she\u0027s trapped inside this condition, said Charmaine.  She can also experience dficulties in public, when she is surrounded by large groups of people. One Christmas Day, when the family ate out at a restaurant, Martha became overwhelmed by the loud noises and was sick all over her plate. Lee, a health and safety consultant, took her off and walked her along a river next to the restaurant to calm her down as she\u0027s feels much more secure outdoors where she has space to wander freely. Martha\u0027s behaviour is sometimes unpredictable when she meets new people. Charmaine recalled: When someone she doesn\u0027t know comes to the house, she\u0027ll get apprehensive and cling to me or Lee. But then after a while she\u0027ll get more used to it and she might get up and give the new person a toy. Keen to maintain Martha\u0027s quality of le, the couple frequently take their children for days out to National Trust properties, with extensive grounds, where they can enjoy the great outdoors, which Martha is passionate about.

The royal nuptials will take place at stunning Windsor Castle on October 12 - the same place Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married just a few months ago.  Since the engagement, there have been whispers about what the Princess of York, who is ninth-in-line to the throne, will do with her name. Her official post-wedding title hasn\u0027t yet been confirmed, but sources say she\u0027ll remain a member of the public.

Scientists discovered a clear link between restricting screen use and improved thinking skills. Canadian researchers looked at 4,520 children aged eight to 11 for the study, which showed that longer breaks from devices help cognitive , while outside activity benefits physical health. So what does too much time with technology actually do to children’s brains, how can you help them cut down, and what should they be doing instead? What can too much screen time do to our children’s brains? Psychologist Dr Susan Marchant-Haycox says brain imaging has shown that frequent users of smartphones tend to have smaller grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex – the brain region that serves cognition and motor control – which can inhibit a person’s ability to pay attention. She adds that obsessive screen time can cause a greater risk of depression, anxiety, insomnia and impulsive behaviour. One study suggests that smartphone obsession can cause greater levels of the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid, GABA. Susan says: “GABA in the brain’s cortex inhibits neurons, compared to levels of the neurotransmitter called glutamate-glutamine, which energises brain signals. “That will create a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can cause anxiety.  What can too much screen time do to our children socially and physically? Spending too much time glued to a screen can make children introverted due to a lack of social interaction, says Dr Marchant-Haycox. This means that youngsters can “become prisoners to their own mobiles or tablets”. Dr Michael Hogan, a lecturer in psychology at the National University of Ireland, says that smartphone use is a modern extension of children watching television after school – except now they’re watching on portable devices. He said of the gadgets: “They’ve got better and better, which means they are certainly more engaging than they used to be – and will continue to no doubt get more sophisticated. There are lots of techniques which are used to draw people back in again and again. “Our social motivations are pretty much universal and have not changed in the last 20 years, but instead the social engagement is being moved to the screens. “It’s quite easy to engage on a device, so this screen time is taking away from face-to-face time. There is the risk of a child becoming more insular.” A study published this year showed that youths who use social media a lot are at greater risk of sleep disturbance that leads to obesity, while there was a 40% decrease in obesity in those whose parents limited their screen time.  Smartphones and creativity Dr Marchant-Haycox argues that excessive use of mobiles and tablets can also inhibit creative thinking – but there can be some advantages to a child’s development, depending on how the devices are used. “Some research suggests that mobile devices could encourage and support imaginative play, rather than just keeping children occupied,” she says. “But a time limit of mobile or tablet usage must be monitored by parents.” Dr Hogan suggests analysing what your child is like in the presence of other youngsters, to see whether they actively engage in physical, real-le scenarios, or stay buried in their gadgets. He says: “If they turn to their phones when they are in a stimulated environment it may mean you need to monitor their time use.” And he says that while some video games may seem more stimulating than other things, it’s about mixing up dferent activities, in the way you might y your child’s diet.

A dispute over pay and conditions between a host of airlines and staff in six European countries will see them walk out for 24 hours. Ryanair initially cancelled 150 flights due to an unnecessary strike in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy. But on Thursday the airline said pilots in Germany would also be going on strike, with up to 100 flights shelved as a result. The airline has said that all affected customers have received emails and texts advising them of the cancellations.  Ryanair\u0027s chief operations officer Peter Bellew said the action was deeply regrettable. It is deeply disappointing that some of our customers and our people in Germany tomorrow will have their flights disrupted by an unnecessary strike called at short notice, he said. The strikes are the latest in a series of walkouts by staff at Europe\u0027s largest low-cost airline. The cancellations account for around 10 percent of its 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday, the airline said this week. On September 12 dozens of flights were cancelled in Germany after pilots and flight attendants refused to work for 24 hours.  In August, several days of strikes involving staff in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands saw hundreds of flights cancelled. It was estimated to have affected around 55,000 customers. Meanwhile, earlier this month Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u0027Leary said strikes by pilots were necessary to keep air fares down. He insisted industrial disputes with the airline\u0027s staff have caused minimal disruption as he pledged not to roll over. The Irish airline also says it has made signicant progress in recent weeks in negotiations, including reaching collective labour agreements with staff in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.

A letter sent by a council\u0027s school meals service said  she did not pay the money or provide a packed lunch it would be seen as a child protection concern. The mum, who asked not to be named, branded the letter outrageous and said it criminalised poverty.  The self-employed mother, who shares the cost with her ex-partner, said although payment of the bill was late this time, they always cleared the debt, reports the Daily Post .   The letter relating to the bill owed to Ysgol Twm o\u0027r Nant in Denbigh, states: Should you fail to pay for your child\u0027s meals or provide them with a packed lunch, this will be highlighted as a child protection concern. An instant referral will be made to Denbighshire\u0027s Social Services Children\u0027s team, who will then carry out an investigation into the circumstances around the lack of provision of food. The mum said: I was seriously shocked to receive the letter and what angered me most was the tone of it. It could\u0027ve been worded very dferently without the threat to report me to social services. It\u0027s like criminalising poverty. Fair enough, we owed the money. The dinner bill has to be coordinated between two separated parents and it can be dficult keeping track, but we always pay it. There are many people in financial dficulty in Denbighshire. I am on a low income myself, but my children are not entitled to free school meals. School meals in Denbighshire cost \u0026pound2.20 per day.  Once a parent\u0027s outstanding bill reaches \u0026pound20, the council\u0027s policy is that children will not be given a school meal until the debt is paid in full, although a basic sandwich will be provided. For a child to qualy for free school dinners, parents or s must be in receipt of certain benefits. The mum added: Working poverty is a big issue in our area. What is also shocking is that  you don\u0027t pay the bill, your child would only be given a basic sandwich and then they get stigmatised. The parent\u0027s financial status is not the child\u0027s fault. I\u0027m really low-waged and there are lots of parents in the same situation, you only have to look at how many working families are turning to food banks, but to be threatened to be reported to social services when you\u0027re only trying your best is absolutely outrageous. A spokesman for the council said: “The welfare of our pupils is paramount and it is imperative that they either receive a school meal or a packed lunch.

A blast of icy conditions blowing in from the Arctic will push thermometers below zero and could herald snow in Scotland and northern parts of England. Much of the UK is basking in warm summer conditions with temperatures hitting 25C in some parts of the country - but experts say the Indian summer is about to come to an abrupt end. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “It is going to turn colder towards the weekend with a northerly flow of Arctic air bringing temperatures down compared to earlier in the week. “Friday will feel colder and we could see some patchy frosts first thing, daytime temperatures will reach the mid-teens at best and it will feel colder in the north.  “Overnight into Saturday we could see more widespread frosts with temperatures widely dropping, anywhere in the country could see a frost. “It will stay cooler into Sunday and after some morning fog there is the likelihood of sunny spells with daytime temperatures around the mid-teens again.” Gale-force winds will also affect northern parts of the country, she warned. She added: “There will be blustery showers around on Saturday and along northern coasts there will be the risk of gales. “Across the southern half of the country there is more of a chance of seeing some sunshine, the risk of frosts will continue into the start of next week. “There may be some sleet or wet snow over high ground in the north on Sunday night.” Temperatures are forecast to hit -2 in Scotland while Wales and the north of England will see single digit figures. Earlier this week, forecasters suggested Britain could be set for more snow than ever before over the coming months .    The UK could see weeks of snow over the Christmas period as bookmakers say the country could be facing the coldest winter on record. And Coral bookmakers have slashed the odds at 6-4 for this winter to be the coldest on record. Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: We might be enjoying some autumn sunshine now but all the signs are pointing towards a bleak winter with weeks of snow forecast for the Christmas months. Our odds suggest there’s a real chance of this winter entering the record books as the coldest.

Although the boy appears to be coping with the pain, he asks more than once  they are done. The youngster\u0027s mum was aware of what was happening and even recorded the footage herself at their home in Ohio, USA. A photo shared online shows the youngster\u0027s new S tattoo on the top of his right arm.

The Air Niugini passenger aircraft overshot the runway as it came into land and crashed into the water. Dramatic pictures shared on social media show the Boeing 737 partially submerged with small speedboats surrounding it. According to local media, 36 passengers and 11 crew members were on board and all were rescued, with locals using their boats to take people to safety.    The passengers and crew were taken to hospital but no serious injuries were reported. It was supposed to land but instead of landing it was 150 yards short and she went down, Jimmy Emilio, general manager of Chuuk Airport told Reuters. We don\u0027t really know what happened ... people were rescued by boats - 36 passengers and 11 crew were all rescued, only the plane is sinking right now, he said. The aircraft hit the lagoon surrounding the small island about 9.30 a.m. local time .   An employee at a hotel located close to the runway told  Australia that he initially thought nothing of it as it came into land.  “Then I went back to my workplace and somebody told me, and I looked from the rooftop and the plane was starting to go underwater,” he said.

The Tiki Beach bar is one of Benidorm’s most famous and liveliest pubs on the Costa Blanca and attracts thousands of UK holidaymakers every year. But it will close its doors soon after an order was approved by the Spanish Supreme Court, according to news source Diario Informacion . The bar, which takes pride of place on the Levante Beach, is on the top of the tourist pub crawl list as revellers flock there. But it has been the subject of a string of complaints from neighbours in the Santa Margarita building over the years, including loud music and boozy tourists partying on the beach until the early hours.  And it is now said the Spanish court has ruled in favour of the residents and ordered the closure of the pub in a decision that can’t be appealed. The news has shocked British tourists who say Tiki Beach is the best bar in Benidorm. Alan Gray, 57, of Northumberland, says Benidorm won’t be the same without it. Alan told ChronicleLive: “I can’t believe it that Tiki Beach is closing. I have been going for the past 13 years with a group of lads for St Paddy’s Day. “We always end up at Tiki Beach because the atmosphere is great, the drinks are reasonably priced and the music is good. “And, of course, don’t forget the vistas - it looks out onto Levante Beach and it’s just a great place to have a few beers. “OK there is a party atmosphere that spills out onto the promenade but I have never seen any trouble there in all the years I’ve been going, just lots of holidaymakers having loads of fun. “In fact, I’m going to Benidorm with another set of friends next week, I hope it hasn’t closed by then.”  Karen Hamilton, of Whitley Bay, added: “This is such a shame for Benidorm holidaymakers. It always has a great party atmosphere and a great meeting spot. Tiki Beach is such an integral part of a Benidorm holiday. Thousands of Geordies will be gutted.” Kirsha Knowles, 42, of Newcastle, said: “I am absolutely devastated that it is closing. Tiki Beach is the heart of a Benidorm holiday. “I’ve been going there regularly with my family and with the girls for the past ten years or more. There is always a great atmosphere. Benidorm won’t be the same without it. I’m really gutted, honestly I am.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sir isaac newton predicted world","story":"NewsSir Isaac Newton predicted \u0027world will end in 2060 with Jesus\u0027s second coming\u0027 in newly discovered writingsThe renowned 17th century scientist made the prediction under the alias \u0027Jehovah Sanctus Unus\u0027Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy Coles13:38, 27 SEP 2018Updated13:39, 27 SEP 2018NewsIsaac Newton discovered gravity but was also interested in religion and an avid reader of the Bible \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSir Isaac Newton predicted the world will end in 2060 in newly discovered writings unearthed by academics. The renowned scientist, who discovered gravity, wrote about a second coming of Christ in just over four decades time - marking an end to le as we know it. Born in 1643, Newton was considered an insightful theologian who had a le-long interest in the existence of God and religion. He based a lot of his religious writings on his extensive readings of the Bible.   But in a new set of writings Newton, writing under the alias \u0027Jehovah Sanctus Unus\u0027 predicted the world would reset at 2060 at which point the Earth will once again become “the Kingdom of God”, the Daily Star reports.  “It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner,” he wrote.

We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Crash-2.jpg.jpg ","title":"delays on a90 into dundee this morning","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere are delays on the A90 Forfar Road heading into Dundee this morning.Lane one on the southbound carriageway near the Fintry Drive and Emmock Wood junctions is closed due to a breakdown.Traffic Scotland forecasts disruption for 30 minutes.The incident comes less than 24 hours after an accident along part of the same stretch of the A90.Firefighters had to free a casualty from a car after a serious crash at the Struans roundabout on the A90 Forfar Road after the collision around 12pm.One person was trapped in the car and had to be freed by firefighters using hydraulic cutting gear. 100vw, 622px\" /Two cars and a lorry were said to have been involved.One car was left extensively damaged at the side of the road.Firefighters spend 20 minutes cutting person free after serious crash at Dundee roundabout\" src=\"https:www.eveningtelegraph/fp/firefighters-spend-20-minutes-cutting-person-free-after-serious-crash-at-dundee-roundabout/embed/#?secret=t4S7TmRufq\" data-secret=\"t4S7TmRufq\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Firefighters spend 20 minutes cutting person free after serious crash at Dundee roundabout\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening \" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Dundee-bottom.jpg ","title":"dundee are currently the worst football team in the world","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are currently the worst football team in the world, according to statistics.The pressure is mounting on manager Neil McCann after Saturday\u0026#8217s 3-0 home defeat by Hibernian left his side with a record of six defeats in six Premiership games so far this season.And the beleaguered boss will be even more dismayed to discover that, according to one calculation, the Dark Blues are bottom of a world league.Football website whoscored, which takes data from 153 countries, ranks Dundee at the bottom of the international form guide.According to the site, only two other clubs in the world \u0026#8211 Scottish Championship side Falkirk and Bulgarian outfit Septemvri Sofia \u0026#8211 have lost six in a row.But Dundee\u0026#8217s goal dference of -12 puts them at rock bottom.The Dark Blues\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216progress\u0026#8217 in the table has been eagerly followed by Dundee United fans on Twitter.According to @callum1247, the clinching result was last night when Guingamp picked up a point away to Nimes in France\u0026#8217s Ligue 1.Dundee fans have hit back at the inevitable jibes.

Dundee will be hoping they can buck the trend – and they do have some form for it.Try to recall horric starts in the top flight for clubs – St Mirren in 2014, Livingston in 2005, Hamilton 1989, Dumbarton 1984 and Morton 1987 – and they all end in the same horror show of the drop.In 2014, the Buddies had to wait till their sixth game before picking up points, ending in bottom spot with 30 points. Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton boss martin canning wont be shed a tear for under pressure dundee counterpart neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHamilton boss Martin Canning insists he cannot afford to take any notice of Neil McCann’s plight ahead of Saturday’s clash with bottom side Dundee.Pressure is piling on the Dens Park manager after six straight Ladbrokes Premiership defeats and a Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United.However, Canning noted his side beat St Mirren 3-0 at home on Saturday for their first win in four matches, to give Accies some respite of their own.He said: “You’ve got to go and do your own job and my job on Saturday is to try to get Hamilton Accies three points and  we can do that we’ll be delighted.“That’s just football.

It got people talking and engaging and gave them an opportunity to have a say.“It was a starting point and not the finished article by any means.“But it is something we can build on, because people in this city want to engage and want to make informed choices.”However, while the City Plan makes a clear commitment to boosting the profile of the council-chaired local community planning partnerships , no such representations are made for community councils.A report earlier this month found Dundee City Council spends just a penny per head on funding community councils each year – which is less than any other council area in the country.Elaine said: “The figures are only part of the full picture.“As well as community councils, Dundee has tenants and residents groups.“It has resources and workers at its disposal.“It’s important to the council and its partners that people’s voices are heard because that is the only way we know whether we’re doing the right things to make a dference.”As part of its mission to build “strong and empowered communities”, the Dundee Partnership’s City Plan also aims to encourage more active travel – already on the rise – and ensure locals like where they live .However, the plan’s remit also covers housing, from new affordable builds to the quality of existing social lets.And in those regards, while new build completions are behind schedule – an issue blamed on the long-term nature of such projects – other issues such as fuel poverty are on the wane.And with nine years to go on the City Plan, there’s time yet to convince locals that they can, and do, have a say in the running of where they live.Elaine said: “We have thousands of people who work hard for their communities, often voluntarily, and we take our hats off to them – we couldn’t do what we do without them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"local park and ride plan derailed by u turn from major employer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA change of heart from one of Scotland’s most high-profile employers has derailed council plans to build a park and ride in Kinfauns.The “surprising” objection from landowner Edrington Group, whose brands include the Famous Grouse and Macallan, has sunk hopes of completing the park and ride by the end of next year.The council is now weighing up the use of compulsory purchase powers to secure the site after reports the company now wants to build houses.People in the Carse of Gowrie hoped the park and ride would ease traffic congestion and provide a more regular bus service to Perth.Edrington hosted a Perth council consultation exercise on the plans in its offices in 2015. This was positive and the company submitted no objections to the full planning application, which was granted consent in February 2016.But the drinks giant’s intervention against the inclusion of the park and ride proposal in the draft Local Development Plan has delayed proceedings, and may lead to the proposal being withdrawn.Carse of Gowrie councillors agreed this would be a blow for residents.An Edrington spokesman said: “We have registered an objection to the extent and selection of land within the current proposal in order to protect our position.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baca0cbd2edf-e1538045595809-464x564.jpg ","title":"locals put up posters in bid to stop revellers using dundee close as a toilet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPosters have been put up at a block of flats in a bid to stop revellers urinating in the stairwell on the way back from nightspots.The flyers have appeared at a block of flats on St Andrews Street in the city centre.One resident said that there have been issues with people using the area as a toilet after leaving pubs and clubs.Posters warning that “peeing in someone’s property is punishable by law” have now appeared in the block of flats.It shows a man urinating and tells people to “please respect the residents of this house”.Maryfield councillor Georgia Cruickshank says she admires the initiative used in attempt to curb the “disgusting” behaviour, but said additional public toilets may go some way to tackling the issue.She said: “I am aware that these types of issues can happen from time to time.“It is unacceptable that tenants are having to put up with this type of thing.“Good on whoever has decided to create these posters.“I certainly wouldn’t want this type of thing happening on my front door.“There is a lot of nightle in the area, but in no way is that an excuse to use a resident’s close in this fashion.”Ms Cruickshank said that with the arrival of extra visitors to the city, there is perhaps a greater need for more public toilets with the additional boost to the day-time and night-time economy.She added: “There maybe is a call to review the amount of public toilets that are accessible after closing time.”One resident said that there has been an ongoing issue with people urinating in the close.She said: “On occasions it can smell really bad.

the Betfred Cup to Ayr United, making it seven defeats on the trot.In none of those matches have Dundee managed to put themselves in front and their gaffer is desperate for the players to at least give themselves a chance of picking up a result.In order to do that, they’ll have to get the better of an Accies side high on confidence after a 3-0 thumping of St Mirren in match that has had a bit of extra spice over the past few years.And despite extra pressure on him to get the result, Neil still has faith in his side.He said: “It’s a huge game, they always have been against Hamilton.“The games against Livingston, Hamilton, Kilmarnock are going to be so important and then Hibs and Hearts.“We are still striving for that first win and we’ll keep trying to give everything to get ourselves that first goal that can at least put ourselves in a position to go and get that first win.“I still think that you could see in the first 45 minutes last Saturday, there is a team there.“I would just love to see them give themselves an easier ride by putting themselves in front.”The Dens gaffer is also hopeful of having some extra bodies back fit after a punishing injury-hit spell.Josh Meekings, Genseric Kusunga, Nathan Ralph and Sofien Moussa all missed the defeat to Hibs with injury while Kenny Miller was suspended.He’ll also miss Saturday’s trip to Hamilton while Kharl Madianga, Calvin

years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s been more than a century since the icy waters of the Canadian Arctic brought a catastrophic end to Dundee whaling ship the Nova Zembla.The 43 crew members who braved the treacherous course were luckily rescued – but the sunken wreckage was seemingly lost forever.That is, until now.Two researchers have discovered the remains of the ship.Of more than 200 stricken whaling UK vessels, it is the only wreckage to have ever been found.Matthew Ayre and Michael Moloney, from Calgary, found wood from the Nova Zembla’s mast across a beach.Because of the remoteness of the location the discovery was made, the wood from the vessel is believed to have been untouched for 116 years.The pair were able to pinpoint the location of the wreckage – having only an eight-hour window due to the torrid conditions.Julie McCombie, curator at The McManus, said she and her team were left stunned by their efforts.She said: “It really is amazing to think that 116 years after it sank that they were able to trace anything that was left, especially with the conditions over there.“It was so cold and dark, so the fact that Matt was able to pinpoint exactly where the wreckage was located was really quite something.“He had previously visited us and the university a few years ago to discover some of the journals and he’s kept in touch with us about getting us involved in the project.“The fact that not only this was the first Scottish ship discovered after all that time, but was one from Dundee, just made it all the more special for us.” 100vw, 929px\" /Nova Zembla was destroyed after a collision off Baffin Bay on September 18 1902.Fellow whalers on the Dundee ships, the Diana and the Eclipse, were able to rescue the terried crew.Log books from the whalers on board give a full account of the event with claims that the Nova Zembla struck a reef while battling a storm.The boat sunk fast but the valuable whale bone was rescued and transferred to the Diana.And Julie believes the researchers aren’t finished with their work on Dundee’s whaling history.She said: “In the future they are hoping to get more funding to go down again and I think they would like to get people from here involved too.“They’ve been talking about doing a talk or an open event which would involve the relatives of those who were on the ship, which would be fantastic.“Although it is frowned upon now, Dundee was practically founded on whaling.“Without it, we wouldn’t have seen all the industries that came after and we wouldn’t have all the incredible changes that we’ve seen now.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baca09be5ceb-846x564.jpg ","title":"walking tours look to showcase ghostly goings on at local country

explains why he feels being dundee united boss is the hardest job in scottish football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere were some cursory glances around the Press room at the Falkirk Stadium after Dundee United’s 2-0 win on Saturday when boss Csaba Laszlo, almost out of nowhere, asserted the following.“The most dficult job in the Scottish Championship, or Scottish football at the moment, is to be the manager of Dundee United.”He qualied that statement by adding that it is also dficult for his players to pull on the black and tangerine but his remarks did pique the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"

will make the site more accessible, as well as improving security by reducing the number of access points on Academy Street to one.An uplighting system is also set to be installed in order to highlight the historic architecture of the building, and signage will be removed to \u0026ldquo historic integrity to the Academy Street facade.The project marks the first stage of an action plan,

about a smooth transition.Recipients who usually receive payments every four weeks will have to wait five weeks, meaning people will have to stretch their October payment for an extra week.The report, which is to be considered by Marr area committee on Tuesday, said: “The Aberdeenshire support and advice team has noted an increase in the number of Universal Credit claimants requesting a crisis grant while waiting for their initial monthly payment.”Scottish Welfare Fund statistics show 1,475 people applied to the council for crisis loans in 2017-18 compared with 740 in 2013-14 – and the number of applicants has risen annually in the last four years.According to the report, the council is “strengthening the network of support services” by, for example, advising people who believe the change will leave them short of cash to apply for a Universal Credit advance payment from the Department of Work and Pensions.The transition also means claimants will be able to keep on having their rent payment taken directly from their benefit or pay their rent themselves.Council staff are also working with property landlords in an effort to inform them about problems tenants may face.A drop-in event organised by the council for private landlords is to take place in Banchory today.“This will give landlords the opportunity to ask any questions regarding Universal Credit,” the report said.It added: “Prior to the roll-out in Kincardine and Mearns and north Aberdeenshire, a number of events took place to raise awareness and share information .“These events were well received and similar events are planned in Inverurie and Stonehaven during October.“A further event will be arranged in Ballater  required.”Universal credit is due to be rolled out in full in Aberdeen on October

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rocky start for mid argyll rfc in first round in scottish schools cup","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 8:45 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe team scheduled to play Mid Argyll Rugby Club\u0026#8217s under 16s in the first round of the Scottish Schools Cup pulled out on the morning of the game \u0026#8211 but local school pupils saved the day.Duncanrig School should have played the Mid Argyll youngsters at Lochgilphead Joint Campus, but cancelled at the last minute.A team made up of Lochgilphead high, Tarbert Academy, Campbeltown Grammar and Islay high schools was quickly formed to play as South Argyll Schools  for this cup competition.Coach Lee Buckley said: ‘As the Islay school boys were already on the ferry over for the fixture, we decided to play a development game between the 22 SAS squad members at the joint campus.‘Everyone put in an amazing effort and this session could be key when the team plays Marr College in the second round of the cup.’The team also struggled to find a pitch to play another home game on recently as there are no suitable rugby pitches in Mid Argyll.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

They heard there is a stigma associated with talking about loneliness and isolation but people of all ages are at risk of being lonely. It often occurs at times of change in people’s lives such as leaving home, starting a family, retirement or bereavement.A recent survey over the whole of NHS Highland, including Mid Argyll, found that 67 per cent of older people sometimes feel lonely and for eight per cent of respondents this increased to often feeling extremely lonely.Cumlodden Guild signed up to NHS Highland’s campaign called Reach Out – make a dference to someone who’s lonely, making a pledge to raise awareness in the church congregation and to talk about loneliness and isolation in their local communities.Alison McGrory said: \u0026#8216My job is about preventing health problems before they arise and enabling people to lead as healthy a le as possible. Loneliness is a bigger public health risk than physical activity or weight management and causes as many premature deaths as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This is a compelling reason to take action.\u0026#8216NHS Highland’s Reach Out campaign has been developed to encourage more people to think about the part they can play in reducing loneliness. It costs nothing to reach out a hand of kindness and say hello to someone in the street or knock on a neighbour’s door to check they are OK.\u0026#8216You can sign up to the Reach Out campaign on facebook at NHS Highland Reach Out.\u0026#8217Sue Campbell of Cumlodden Church Guild said: \u0026#8216Cumlodden Church Guild is delighted to sign up to the Reach Out campaign. We are aware that isolation is an issue throughout Mid Argyll – some people live alone and others live in remote areas and find it dficult to get out and about. We are all now much more aware of the health issues associated with loneliness and are going to spread the word amongst our wider congregation and with our friends and neighbours.\u0026#8217PIC:Members have reached out to anyone suffering from loneliness or isolation. no_a39CumloddenLoneliness01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"feathers fly as legion floats fundraisers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/09/18, 1:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt was a busy weekend of fun and fundraising for Inveraray branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.A very well attended annual coffee morning and children\u0026#8217s bake-off took place at Inveraray Church Hall on Saturday September 22.Ashley McDougall won the 10 to 14 years age group, while Abbie and Ollie  McKinley won the eight to 10 category and, Emilie MacDonald the eight and under contest.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

But me and Robert are also heading to Australia so hopefully he’ll be okay without us.” Savoy general manager Barbara Christie said: “We were delighted to have Bobby as part of the day and he was a real star. “He came to get ready beforehand – complete with his doggy aftershave. “A couple of years ago this might have seemed odd but it’s something that more people are now wanting. “Dogs are a big part of the family so I’m sure it’s not the last time we’ll host a ceremony like this.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrTartanPetsAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents. The latest proposed plans are on display at Belleisle Golf Club.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter

drink-focussed events enjoyed the very best of what the Scottish Borders has to serve up.\nBetween a food fayre, chef demonstrations and charity dinner, there was something for everyone to appreciate across the Local Food on Local Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is made from scratch in Hawick, using malted barley grown in the Borders.\nProfessional chefs \u0026ndash Jacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell from The Sisters Restaurants, Glasgow, Amanda Jordan of the Firebrick Brasserie, Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students. It made sense to use as much local produce as we could.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a natural menu that reflects this part of the countryside, and my style of cooking.\nFiona Richmond of Scotland Food and Drink praised the evening\u0026rsquos menu, describing it as \u0026ldquoabsolute perfection.\nAnd David Cochrane, Chief Executive of HIT Scotland, who attended the dinner on behalf of the receiving charity was also enthusiastic.\nHe told us: \"The quality and passion behind the food tonight really put Scotland on the map and of that we\u0026rsquore really proud.\nHe also talked of the challenges of recruiting, and the essential practice of attracting people to the industry by showcasing the opportunities that are available and how up to date skills need to be developed, which is where scholarships really come to the fore.\nDinner guest Will Haegeland, deputy general manager of Cringletie House Hotel, is actively working to encourage increased tourism to the area as part of his role as Chair of the Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership.\nHe said: \"Food and tourism are key growth sectors in the Scottish Borders, and there aren\u0026rsquot many others.\n\"We have a chance to increase visitor numbers and bring new resources \u0026ndash we need to see more young people choosing hospitality as an industry of choice.\n\u0026ldquoIt is an exciting industry to be a part of and this is a great type of event to showcase that. We need young people to be showcased more and to demonstrate their pride in their work.\nIt is hoped the Local Food on Local Plates showcase will become an annual event in the Borders College calendar.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"trial-dates-set-for-nursery-workers-accused-of-cruelty","story":"TWO nursery workers from Duns have been accused of forcibly dragging about children in their care and locking them inside cupboards.\nNicola Jeffrey, who is 22, and 34-year-old Teresa Renton are charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause a reasonable person fear and alarm on ious occasions between January 1, 2015, and August 1, 2016.\nThe offence is alleged to have been committed at Little Reivers Nursery in Duns, which has since closed.\nThey both pleaded not guilty at Jedburgh Sherf Court to a charge of shouting, forcibly dragging children about and lting them off the floor by the arm, as well as locking children inside cupboards and refusing to let them out.\nThe charge also relates to making offensive and abusive comments towards and about young children, and behaving in an aggressive, threatening and abusive manner towards young children in their care.\nJeffrey is further alleged to have seized hold of the arm of an injured child who was receiving treatment from a colleague and it was later ascertained the arm had sustained two fractures.\nJeffrey is also said to have changed the nappy of a child in a public place in view of the public on a concrete floor without using any mat.\nRenton of Ainslie Terrace and Jeffrey of Rachel Drive, both Duns, pleaded not guilty to the charge.\nTwo days have been set aside for a trial at Jedburgh Sherf Court on October 25 and 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"biker-michael-meets-the-men-who-saved-his-life","story":"A BORDERS biker has met with the two paramedics who saved him.\nMichael Hallsworth was left fighting for his le after a horror crash near Kelso in the summer.\nThe 64-year-old retired electrical supervisor smashed into a roadside telecom box after being knocked from his bike.\nAs well as suffering broken ribs and a broken shoulder, the dad-of-two also punctured a lung.\nHe was saved after a fast-acting team from the Scottish Ambulance Service managed to re-inflate his lungs at the scene, allowing him to breathe.\nMichael spent six days in hospital recovering from the crash.\nHe told us: \"When I woke up in hospital the next day, the doctors said  not for the intervention of the paramedics, I would not have survived.\n\"I was told my lung had collapsed and they had saved my le.\"\nMichael was speaking for first time about the horror crash after meeting up with the Scottish Ambulance Service team of Guy Anderson and Stuart Hogg \u0026ndash both based at Kelso Ambulance Station \u0026ndash that saved his le.\nHe continued: \"I was on my way to Hawick when I came past the racecourse at Kelso.\n\"That is the last thing I can actually remember but apparently just past there, I overtook a car and the car turned right into me and knocked me off.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100

be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolic 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday, October 14.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip. Then we\u0027ve got the JustGiving page as well.\"  Muay Thai is Thailand\u0027s national sport but the WTKA Unied World Championships will be held in Carrara, between Pisa and Genoa, over October and November.  It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

John Harrison, warden of Aberlady Bay Local Nature Reserve, added: \u0026ldquoMargaret was a truly inspirational person.  \u0026ldquoMore often than not the first to get going on a task and the last to finish, Margaret would commonly work longer than volunteers a fraction of her age.  \u0026ldquoShe was a very well-liked and fun member of the volunteer group, who achieved a great deal for nature conservation over the ten years she volunteered with us.

It hopes to transform the building, which has lain empty for six years, into a workspace offering \u0026ldquoinspiration and support to freelancers, commuters, remote workers, artists, businesses, social enterprises and community groups in and around the town.  The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable. This grant will let us engage an architect to assess the building and estimate the costs.  Sustaining Dunbar, formed in 2008, is a community development trust and charity. It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year. And profits from the operation will be invested in practical support for local community groups and social enterprises.  Jo McNamara, chairwoman of Sustaining Dunbar, felt the funding boost was \u0026ldquoa signicant step towards our vision of developing something really special in Dunbar.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhile creating more workspace is essential for the area, what\u0026rsquos truly exciting is the way co-working spaces like this can bring people together \u0026ndash to share ideas, to collaborate and to build a stronger community.

Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.

She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

And he will say that Labour is ready to deliver \u0026ldquothe radical plan we need to rebuild and transform Britain, telling delegates: \u0026ldquoThe old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  Mr Corbyn will say Britain needs a government \u0026ldquocommitted to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training, and will promise large-scale public and private investment in wind and solar power, as well as subsidies to make all homes energy-efficient.  The insulation programme alone would create 160,000 jobs alone spread across the UK.  Changes to planning guidance will aim to encourage private investment to double onshore wind power over 12 years, while offshore wind will be increased sevenfold and solar power threefold.  \u0026ldquoScotland would clearly benefit extensively from this level of investment in terms of jobs and living standards, and it is something that would be very welcome in Scotland, stressed the Labour leader\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos speech comes at the end of a four-day conference which has been dominated by Brexit but has seen the Labour leader and shadow chancellor John McDonnell set out a range of policies to reverse inequalities in wealth and economic power.  These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: \"Those are the words of the motion that was supported by the National Executive and the Shadow Cabinet and that is what is being voted on in conference\u0026hellip  \"Keir put that in because it\u0027s what\u0027s there in the motion. We will challenge this Government. If they don\u0027t meet our six tests, we will vote against it, and then we will take it from there, he declared.  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over the nature of a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell insisted Remain would not be part of the question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote conference speech yesterday he again claimed not only had Remain to be an option in any future referendum but no-one, including the Shadow Chancellor, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  After the Brexit debate, delegates approved by a show of hands the proposed motion, which, in the event of the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plan failing to get MPs\u0026rsquo support, called for a general election with the option of a second referendum  one did not happen.

The Scottish made thriller Calibre leads this year\u0026rsquos nominations, with five.  However there is no women in the best director categories for either factual or fiction, or the writer for film and television category.  : Trainspotting 2 triumphs at Bafta Scotland awards  Karen Gillan\u0026rsquos debut feature film as a writer and a director, The Party\u0026rsquos Just Beginning, is in the running for best feature film, as is the zombie comedy drama Anna and the Apocalypse and Nae Pasaran, the documentary about Scottish workers who helped sabotage the Chilean dictator General Pinochet.  Gillan\u0026rsquos film was produced by Claire Mundell, of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Synchronicity Films.  Last year, the best factual director went to Louise Lockwood for Fair Isle: Living on the Edge, and Hope Dickson Leach won the best writer category for The Levelling.  This year the short list for the best factual director is John MacLaverty for Scotland 78: A Love Story, Matt Pinder for Violent Men: Behind Bars, and Felipe Bustos Serra for Nae Pasaran, while the best director, fiction, category, features Armando Iannucci for The Death of Stalin, Colm McCarthy for Black Mirror: Black Museum and Matt Palmer for Calibre.  Palmer is also in the best writer category, as is Iannucci and David Kane, for Shetland.  : Iannucci given special award by BAFTA Scotland  BAFTA Scotland said that only 18% of entrants to the writer category were women, 21% of entrants to the director of fiction category, and 31% for the director of factual category.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoGiving more talented women the opportunity is one of BAFTA Scotland focuses at present, and we will continue we will continue to work with colleagues in London to look at ways to help redress this balance through initiatives such as our BAFTA Guru New Talent initiative and hope to see more women represented next year.  Women film makers are featured in the categories for Short Film, Features and Factual Series.  Ms MacLaverty noted the lack of women in key categories, and said: \u0026ldquoIt is something that BAFTA, at ground level are always trying to push and try and do something about.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of the industry at the moment, and the jury can only work with what they have - but BAFTA at every level, from panellists to juries, which were 54% female, are aware of this.  The award ceremony for this year\u0026rsquos British Academy of Film and Television Arts in Scotland is on November 4 in Glasgow.  Ms MacLaverty added: \u0026ldquoI might even say it on the night of the ceremony: people just need to employ women, they need to give them the jobs.  \u0026ldquoI love the actress who said: \u0026lsquoTo casting people, could this part be a woman?\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoFrom what I hear, Scotland has never been busier, and crews are being really stretched, and so we are doing a lot of work to fill some training gaps, and I see a lot more women taking part.  Edith Bowman, who is host of the awards, noted: \u0026ldquoIt is not a criticism of Bafta - it is the production companies: women need to be given the opportunity when the production is being put together for cast and crew.  Ms Bowman said she hoped grassroots work by BAFTA will increase female involvement in the short lists next year.  Ms MacLaverty said that the judging panels are only looking for \u0026ldquoexcellence in each category.  : Letters - Hard work\u0026nbspno match for structural inequality  Ms Bowman added: \u0026ldquoThe British Academy Scotland Awards is an exceptional event that champions the very best in creativity and production in Scotland and I am delighted to be ing to host this year.  \u0026ldquoAs an organisation BAFTA Scotland plays such an important role in the support and development of creative talent as well as providing a real platform for recognition.  The best actress in a film category features Ella Hunt, Shauna Macdonald and Sian Phillips., whereas the actress on television prize is between Morven Christie, Kiran Sonia Sawar and Elaine C Smith, for her role in Two Doors Down.  The best actor category will guarantee a Scottish BAFTA for the thriller Calibre, as it features three actors from the film, which was shown on Netflix: Tony Curran, Jack Lowden and Martin McCann.

The Labour leader said his party was \"ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997 and would in power deliver \"a real alternative to the people of Britain a radical plan to rebuild and transform our country\".  At the conclusion of the four-day gathering, Mr Corbyn set out plans for:  *a \"green jobs revolution\" to create 400,000 skilled jobs in windfarms and home insulation  *workers\u0027 seats on company boards, and the creation of employee shareholding funds  *an end to the \"racket\" of privatisation and outsourcing  *public services with \"fairness and humanity\" at their heart  *a new tax on second homes in England to pay for house-building  *an extension of free childcare south of the border and  *a foreign policy driven by \"progressive values and international solidarity\", with no more \"reckless wars, like Iraq or Libya\".  Mr Corbyn declared: \"Change in our country is long overdue. Every month this Government remains in power, the worse things get  \"We will rebuild the public realm and create a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. And after a decade of austerity, the next Labour government will confront the challenge of rebuilding our public services.\"  At the end of a conference dominated by Brexit, Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour would vote against Theresa May\u0027s Chequers plan and keep the option of a second referendum on EU withdrawal \"on the table\".  But he left no doubt that a general election is his preferred outcome, sending a message to the Prime Minister: \"Brexit is about the future of our country and our vital interests. It is not about leadership squabbles or parliamentary posturing.  \"If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland,  you protect jobs, people\u0027s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.  \"But  you can\u0027t negotiate that deal, then you need to make way for a party that can.\"  Mr Corbyn sought to draw a line under the anti-Semitism scandals which have dogged Labour over the summer, promising to \"eradicate anti-Semitism, both from our party and wider society\" and telling the Jewish community: \"We are your ally.\"  But he made clear that he would not back away from criticism of Israel, condemning illegal settlements and the detention of Palestinian children as an \"outrage\".  And he announced - to sustained applause and the waving of Palestinian flags - that a Labour government would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it took office.  He issued an appeal for unity to the feuding wings of his party and called for an end to abuse on social media.  In a riposte to critics who accuse him of narrowing Labour to a Leftist cult, he insisted the party must remain a \"broad church\" and declared: \"Our movement has achieved nothing when ided...We are on a journey together and can only complete it together.\"  Mr Corbyn denounced the \"greed-is-good capitalism\" which led to the financial crash of 2008 and the political and economic establishment which \"strained every sinew\" to shore up the system which created it.  \"We can no longer tolerate a set-up where the real economy, in which millions work, is just a sort of sideshow for the City of London and for banks fixated on piling up profits around the world,\" said the Labour leader.  \"Inequality is not just a matter of incomes. It\u0027s about having a real say too.  \"That\u0027s why we are not only determined to rebuild our economy, communities and public services, but also to democratise them, and change the way our economic system is run in the interests of the majority.\"  He spelt out plans for all private companies with 250 or more staff to reserve one-third of seats on their boards for workers and to transfer 10 per cent of their equity into shareholding funds delivering employees up to \u0026pound500 a year and granting them a voice in corporate decisions.  But he assured businesses Labour would also deliver \"what you need to succeed and to expand and modernise our economy - more investment in our transport, housing and digital infrastructure, more investment in education and skills, so workers are more productive\".  Warning of the rise of far-right politics around the world since the crash, Mr Corbyn said: \"People in this country know that the old way of running things isn\u0027t working any more. And unless we offer radical solutions, others will fill the gap with the politics of blame and ision.\"  He declared that Labour was winning the public debate and now represented \"the new political mainstream\" with \"an alternative to the politics of austerity, of social ision and of international conflict\".  And he won a standing ovation as he promised: \"Where the Tories have ided and ruled, we will unite and govern. We represent the new common sense of our time. And we are ready to deliver on it.  \"United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997. So that when we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government.\"  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, claimed Mr Corbyn had shown at every turn how he was unfit to govern.  \u0026ldquoAll he offers are failed ideas that didn\u0026rsquot work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste just like last time.  Mr Lewis said the Labour leader had confirmed the Opposition was \u0026ldquoopening the door to re-running the referendum, which, he added, \u0026ldquowould take us all back to square one.  Ian Blackford for the SNP claimed Labour offered Scotland nothing but \u0026ldquoeconomic chaos and incompetence.  The Highland MP said while Mr Corbyn might have been forced into saying he would not accept a no-deal Brexit, he remained committed, like the Tories, to taking Scotland out of the EU against its will and imposed a \u0026ldquoreckless plan to drag Scotland off a hard Brexit clf-edge.  He added: \u0026ldquoAfter a bitterly ided conference, dominated by rows over Brexit, racism, and sectarianism, Labour have shown they aren\u0026rsquot even fit for opposition let alone government.  Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said: \u0026ldquoOnly Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership could fudge Brexit this much. By refusing to unequivocally back campaigning for a final say on Brexit, Labour is committed to nothing.  The East Dunbartonshire MP added: \u0026ldquoThe public know where Corbyn\u0026rsquos heart lies on Brexit and they don\u0026rsquot trust him.

It emerged on Wednesday that Tory MP David Rutley, a former executive at Asda and PepsiCo, had been given the brief at the Department of Agriculture earlier this month.  The UK government\u0026rsquos own analysis has suggested there could be shortages of food supplies after a No Deal Brexit because of logjams at ports and knock on effects on road haulage.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Ms Sturgeon was asked by SNP MSP Rona Mackay  the possibility of rationing should mean a stop to \u0026ldquothis Brexit madness.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoThis news would have made most people across the UK stop in their tracks. The Tories\u0026rsquo stewardship of Brexit and the UK as a whole is proving so catastrophic that they have had to appoint a minister for food supplies, which is the first time that such a post has been held since world war two.  \u0026ldquoHow has it come to this situation? It is shameful, and it should be a source of shame for a long time to come for every member of the Conservative Party.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that it will not come to food rationing in this country.  \u0026ldquoIf there ever comes a day when there is food rationing in this country because of a Tory Brexit, perhaps the first people who should bear the burden of that are Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis and Michael Gove - all people who perpetrated a dishonesty on the people of this country.

The government gave the loan to Ferguson Marine, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, in September 2017 after it experienced cash flow problems.  At the time, it was falling behind on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two new CalMac ferries.  However Finance Secretary Derek Mackay did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee about the loan until April, a few weeks before he publicly announced another \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos.  He later confirmed the money was needed to ensure the firm\u0027s \"viability\".  Ferguson Marine is part of the Clyde Blowers empire created by Monaco-based tycoon Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0027s Council of Economic Advisers.  The two loans are given a \"very brief\" paragraph in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consolidated accounts for 2017-18, which were published on Thursday.  They are described as a \u0026ldquostrategic investment in Scotland\u0026rsquos industrial capability.  In its accompanying report, Audit Scotland gave the accounts a clean bill of health.  The watchdog said the government underspend was \u0026pound339m on a \u0026pound34.5bn budget, made up of \u0026pound287m resource and \u0026pound52m capital, up from a total underspend of \u0026pound85m in 2016-17.  The main underspends were in Education and Skills  and Rural Economy .  Auditor General Caroline Gardner said improvements were needed to aid transparency, specically a new framework about financial interventions in private companies.  She said there was \u0026ldquolimited public information about the financial support to Ferguson\u0026rsquos Marine and a \u0026pound25m of loans to Fe-based manufacturer Bi-Fab.  Her report said: \"The provision of loan facilities to private sector companies highlights the Scottish Government\u0027s increasing risk appetite in providing financial support and guarantees to support policy objectives.  \u0026ldquoThere is a need for the Scottish Government to be more transparent about its overall approach in providing signicant public funds to support private companies.  \u0026ldquoWhile the business cases for loan support were clear, there is no framework in place to support the Government\u0027s decision making or approach in providing loans to private companies.  It added that by August this year, \u0026pound26m of the \u0026pound45m Ferguson loan had been drawn down.  She said: \"The Scottish Government has taken some important steps to improving its financial reporting, but there are a number of areas it can improve on to help support the Parliament and public in their scrutiny of public finances.  \"It needs to be more transparent about its overall approach to providing loans to private companies and develop a clear framework to guide its decision-making around how it invests public money.\"  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \"It is completely unacceptable that the initial loan from the SNP government to Ferguson Marine only came to light as a result of Freedom of Information legislation.  \"Audit Scotland has correctly identied that the SNP government is routinely conducting its financial affairs under a shroud of secrecy.  \"The SNP government must listen to the criticisms of Audit Scotland and provide detailed information to the Scottish Parliament regarding the increasing financial risks they are taking with taxpayers\u0027 money.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \"The Auditor General is right to warn of the dangers of loans being given to private companies with no formal framework to show how ministers make their decisions.  \"There may be occasions when it is right for the Government to step in but we have to guard against support being available only to those who have the ears of ministers.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to openness and transparency for the public resources we use to support the Scottish economy and the framework for Scottish Ministers lending to businesses is already set out\u0026nbspin the Scottish Public Finance Manual.  \"As Audit Scotland recognises, the Scottish Government undertakes appropriate due diligence prior to any commitment of funds. We informed the Finance Committee of the loans to both BiFab and FMEL.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend the government had been \"timid\" on stopping cuts and ending Tory austerity.  He said: \u0026ldquoIn the week where we learned that le expectancy has fallen for the first time in 35-years in Scotland \u0026ndash and crime has risen \u0026ndash the SNP should be doing everything it can to improve the lives of people in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than using the money available to them, SNP ministers have simply sat on their hands and done nothing while services suffer.  \u0026ldquoThe fact there is a \u0026pound115m underspend on education, while schools are in crisis and pupils are being failed, is simply unacceptable and will rightly anger parents.\"  Mr Rennie added: \"The Scottish Government should be squeezing their budget until the pips squeak to ensure that every penny is working for Scotland. I\u0027m particularly disappointed that at a time when hundreds of teaching posts are vacant, there is such a dramatic underspending in the education budget.\"  Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes said: \u0026ldquoFor the thirteenth consecutive year, the Scottish Government has demonstrated that we have a firm grip on public finances.  \"Under the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Government is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling expenditure to ensure we live within the budget caps that apply, while maximising spending on public services.

It understood Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard this week watered down a demand from his MSPs for the funding to resume.  The party issued a statement saying Labour MSPs gave Ms Dugdale their \u0026ldquofull support and solidarity in her case, but an agreed demand on funding was omitted.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the Wings Over Scotland website, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action brought over her Record column in March 2017.

The UK Labour party agreed to underwrite the full costs of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence, but after the bill approached \u0026pound100,000, Mr Formby announced she had ended support.  It leaves Ms Dugdale facing signicant legal fees to continue her defence, as well as potential damages and costs owed to Mr Campbell.  The party is now reconsidering its decision after pressure from her supporters and claims of \u0026ldquobetrayal.

Jamie McIntyre, the group\u0026rsquos treasurer, said: \u0026ldquoThe council did a statutory consultation on three possible options, but unfortunately, their preferred option was not supported by the parents, so we had a wee bit of a stalemate.  \u0026ldquoQuite casually, we asked Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, which had some land available, how much it would cost to build a new school and, when we saw the costings, we thought it was possible.  \u0026ldquoSo we put it to the council and proposed the model we have here, which is that we finance, design and build the school and we lease it back to them for use as long they need it.  Headteacher Pamela Hill, is delighted with the development, describing the 1970s building as \u0026ldquodated and sad.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere wasn\u0026rsquot much space for us. We really needed a school that was a bit more up-to-date with technology suited for children for the 21st Century as well as somewhere where there is a bit more space for them as well.  The campaign attracted admiration from local politicians. Ian Blackford MP for Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber, said: \u0026ldquoAll those in the community who have made this happen should be congratulated on providing what is a first class facility.  \u0026ldquoThis shows how local people can understand how they can deliver the needs of the local community whether that is education or other vital services.  \u0026ldquoWe need to make sure we give sufficient support to communities on the ground like this and that public authorities are not putting unnecessary hurdles in their way.  Highland councillor Andrew Baxter said the work of Strontian\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquovery talented community could inspire others.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think other communities in the Highlands and across the whole of Scotland could be looking at this and saying that they too could do something like this.  The long term future of the building as a school is still a little uncertain beyond the next decade because there is a break in the lease with the council - although it could run for at least 15 years when the community debt would effectively be cleared.  At that point the council could consider moving the primary pupils into a facility on the grounds of the nearby secondary school - a move which is not possible at the moment under the terms of its PFI contract.  However, whatever the future holds for pupils attending the new Strontian Primary School the building has been specically designed with the longer term in mind.  Part of the design brief was to create a building that could be converted into four affordable homes to benefit the Strontian community further.  Mr McIntyre said the plan is an example of how a community can design services for itself in a joined up way, rather than looking at assets on an inidual basis.  But he also argues there are crucial lessons to be learned about the way communities should be encouraged and supported in development projects.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are all obviously delighted with the new school, but we have had a lot of sleepless nights.  \u0026ldquoThere were times when it seemed it just would not happen and what we want to make sure is that, when communities are working to provide facilities in this way, public bodies do their utmost to support them."},{"url":null,"title":"first-minister-backs-incredibly-valuable-herald-campaign-to-celebrate-stem-innovations","story":"  Her comments come as The Herald launches a campaign to celebrate the remarkable contribution the nation makes to global developments in Stem.  Over the next year our paper will highlight the achievements of our brightest academics and spotlight how research and skills development in our universities and colleges drives progress.  The campaign will also seek to encourage a new generation of enquiring minds to pursue a career in Stem.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoI want Scotland to be the inventor and producer of the innovations that shape the future.  \u0026ldquoCampaigns like this are incredibly valuable in helping to tell the stories of how Scots have shaped the world and continue to do so.  \u0026ldquoChange and innovation are happening all around us in the workplace, the economy and our everyday lives - this is driven largely by developments in Stem.  \u0026ldquoWe know these sectors of the economy are growing quickly and it is likely that they will continue to do so and we have an opportunity to have an innovative, growing economy in Scotland.  The First Minister urged Scotland to \u0026ldquoseize that opportunity by supporting the development of a skilled and adaptable workforce that can take advantage of the growing number and evolving range of Stem jobs.  \u0026ldquoI hope this campaign will help inspire young people to do just that, she said.  The Stem campaign, which is run in partnership with Glasgow University and City of Glasgow College, was also backed by Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council.  She said Stem was a key driver for the development of skills and knowledge that were at the heart of the development of Glasgow\u0026rsquos future economy and prosperity.  She said: \u0026ldquoDeveloping an understanding and knowledge of Stem is important to all of our daily lives and it is essential that we support our young people \u0026ndash tomorrow\u0026rsquos workforce - to become scientically and digitally literate citizens.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very active Stem team at the council with a vision that our young people, educators and partners work collaboratively to support the development of knowledge, skills and opportunities.  CBI Scotland also backed the campaign, saying it was vital more young people were encouraged into Stem.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see an approach which encourages young people into these vital subjects.  \u0026ldquoBusinesses tell us access to skills is their number one concern and,  we want to build a successful modern economy, increasing uptake of Stem subjects is the foundation for that."},{"url":null,"title":"champion-free-market-capitalism-to-see-of-corbyn-insists-tory-minister-sam-gyimah","story":"  His call came as his Conservative colleague George Freeman suggested the Tories had to engage with millennial voters or risk becoming \u0026ldquoa rump party of nostalgic nationalists.  Other Tories expressed concern at the unity of purpose shown at the Labour conference this week ahead of their own, which begins in Birmingham on Sunday, and which is set to be dominated by deep isions on Brexit.  Robert Halfon, the former Conservative Skills Minister, admitted: \u0026ldquoSerious stuff from Labour this week that may resonate with millions of workers. Conservatives need a thoughtful response to this at conference.  Writing on the ConservativeHome website, the MP for Harlow in Essex noted: \u0026ldquoDeep social and economic problems remain. We are stuck in the political rhetoric of the past, rather than providing a proper Tory vision for the future.

We too often speak only for the few, he added.  Writing in Westminster\u0026rsquos The House magazine, Mr Gyimah suggested the Tories had \"lost our way\" with business since the 2008 global financial crash.  He argued that while Tories needed to be honest about the failures of capitalism, simply echoing the criticisms of the Left would drive voters away.  \"When we Conservatives veer between talking business down, ignoring voters\u0027 concerns, and telling businesses to shut up - or worse - it is a clear sign we have lost our way,\" declared the Surrey MP.  \"When it comes to our relationship with business, we must unscramble our compass  we are to stand any chance of defeating the hard left.  \"And whichever side you are on in the Brexit debate, we need to realise that  we are not the party of business, then we are nothing.\"  His comments appear in part to be aimed at Boris Johnson and other Tory Brexiteers who have responded dismissively to business warnings about the economic consequences of leaving the EU.  Mr Gyimah stressed that the party was at its best when it was \"pro-enterprise and pro-endeavour\" in a way that made clear its motive was to improve the lot of the ordinary citizen.  \"If all voters hear from us is an echo of the Left\u0027s concerns, and singing from Labour\u0027s hymn sheet, without an enthusiastic and full-throated endorsement of open markets, and without trumpeting our record, we will have only ourselves to blame when they turn away from capitalism.\"  The minister added: \"We can\u0027t out-Corbyn Corbyn, and  we try, we risk offering a pale imitation that leaves people yearning for the real thing.\"  Meanwhile in the same issue, Mr Freeman, Theresa May\u0026rsquos former policy chief, argued: \u0026ldquoWe are living though one of those moments in political history when everything changes.  \u0026ldquoThis is a 1975, 1945, 1905 moment: when the underlying rules of our system of political economy profoundly change. After the Crash, austerity, a \u0026pound700bn QE programme \u0026ndash which has dramatically shted wealth to those with assets and hit disposal incomes \u0026ndash and now Brexit: we are witnessing a deep structural demographic tectonic sht in UK politics.  \u0026ldquoAmongst a new generation of voters under 45, both capitalism and our model of liberal democracy are suffering a deep crisis of unpopularity. A new generation of aspirational professional voters under 45 are rejecting the old model.

Mary\u0026rsquos Meals has been pledged the \u0026pound1,080,000 funding as part of an agreement between the two countries\u0026rsquo governments. It is the latest in a series of awards to the charity from the Scottish Government, dating back to 2005 after a co-operation agreement between the the two countries was signed.  In August, the Scottish Government announced that it is to provide \u0026pound11 million to support local projects in Malawi focused on health, education, economic development and renewable energy.  News of the funding boost came as Scottish International Development Minister, Ben Macpherson, was welcomed by pupils to Mpangweni Primary School in Dowa, in the central region of the African country.  Mr Macpherson said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove just seen the remarkable dference Mary\u0026rsquos Meals is making here in Malawi.  \u0026ldquoThey are feeding more than a million children thanks to contributions from across Scotland, including from the Scottish Government. It\u0026rsquos been wonderful to see the dference that a nutritious daily meal in school, provided by Mary\u0026rsquos Meals, is making towards helping young people in Malawi to get the best from their education and make the most of their potential.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a real privilege to see the work of Mary\u0026rsquos Meals, supported by iniduals and organisations across Scotland, making such a dference here in Malawi.  During the visit, he met staff and the community volunteers who cook and serve the hearty dish of likuni phala.  Earlier this month, the charity said it is now reaching 1,361,586 impoverished children in 17 countries.  Mary\u0026rsquos Meals was founded in 1992 by chief executive Magnus MacFarlane Barrow, with a vision that \u0026ldquoevery child receives one daily meal in their place of education and that all those who have more than they need, share with those who lack even the most basic things.  Mr MacFarlane-Barrow, who comes from Argyll, said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important to us is the hungry child.  \u0026ldquoWhen there are hungry children in front of us today, we\u0026rsquore going to feed them, and at the same time we\u0026rsquore going to work on the solution to getting them fed in the long term, creating a global movement of people who believe in this vision.  In Dowa, Daniel Adams, executive director of Mary\u0026rsquos Meals UK, said: \u0026ldquoIt was wonderful to see the happy, smiling children as they arrived this morning, with their mugs in hand and ready for the day\u0026rsquos learning.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted that the minister was able to join us to witness the amazing changes that are being created in the lives of so many children across Malawi and beyond.  From feeding 200 children in Malawi in 2002, Mary\u0026rsquos Meals now provides meals in school to 30 per cent of primary school aged children in the country.  And research shows that in schools where children receive Mary\u0026rsquos Meals, enrolment increases, attendance improves, drop-out rates fall, and children are happier, healthier and do better in class.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur mission was born out of the devastating famine in Malawi in 2002. From humble beginnings feeding 200 children in a school not far from here, Mary\u0026rsquos Meals is now providing meals in school for more than 1.3 million children around the world every school day.  \u0026ldquoBy working in partnership with local communities \u0026ndash we have more than 80,000 dedicated volunteers in Malawi alone \u0026ndash Mary\u0026rsquos Meals is ensuring that children, who would otherwise be working or begging for their next meal, are instead sitting in a classroom with a full stomach, learning how to read and write.  \u0026ldquoFunding from The Scottish Government Malawi Development Programme enables us to reach many more children in Malawi, helping them to gain an education and the hope of a brighter future."},{"url":null,"title":"nearly-two-out-of-three-firms-not-preparing-for-brexit-survey-reveals","story":"  The research from the British Chambers of Commerce[BCC] also found that many companies would cut investment and recruitment or even move abroad  Britain left the EU without a deal.  The warning came after Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, cautioned the EU27 that the UK would \"not keep coming back\" to the negotiating table with more Brexit proposals and that it had to start engaging seriously to avoid a clf-edge Brexit.  In Brussels for a meeting with the EU\u0026rsquos Michel Barnier, Jeremy Corbyn warned that a no-deal risked a \u0026ldquonational disaster and, after his talks with the Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, said: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously not negotiating.

In response to questions over delaying Article 50  there were a snap election or second referendum, the Labour leader added: \"Obviously, it would depend when the election is what the scenario would be. We would want to maintain the relationship with Europe around the six tests.\"  The BCC\u0026rsquos survey of more than 2,500 firms across the UK revealed that one in five would cut back on investment  there were no-deal and a similar number would move part or all of their business to the EU or cut back on recruiting staff.  Adam Marshall, its Director General, said: \"Businesses are clear that reaching a deal with the EU, which addresses the future terms of trade and provides certainty, must be the Government\u0027s number one priority.  \"Our evidence is clear: failure to reach a political agreement would have real-world consequences with signicant decreases in both investment and recruitment.  \"Larger firms and those active in international trade would suffer the most from a disorderly and sudden exit from the EU but there will be impacts across the board.  Mr Marshall said most concerning of all was how a \u0026ldquomaterially signicant number of businesses were considering moving part or all of their operations to the EU in the event of a no-deal.  \"Government must act urgently and decisively to get a comprehensive deal done. They also need to use the levers they have, such as the upcoming Budget, to ensure they provide the right conditions for growth at home.\"  At the United Nation in New York, Mr Hunt stressed how Britain had put practical proposals on the table, which honoured the result of the EU referendum and would ensure there was frictionless trade.  But he pointed out: \"Negotiations require two parties to engage seriously, that hasn\u0027t been happening and Britain is not going to keep coming back with more.  The Secretary of State insisted the UK\u0026rsquos proposals were \u0026ldquosensible and what was needed now was for \u0026ldquosome engagement from the EU.  He told Sky News: \"At this stage in the negotiations it was always going to be like this there was always going to be a moment where everyone was looking into the abyss.

So far more than 1,800 people have taken part in a major consultation, voicing their opinion on efforts to boost the area’s recycling rate and reduce the volume of material sent to landfill.

Two options to change kerbside waste collections are proposed as part of the revamped collection system and people are encouraged to share their views with the council on this.Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%.Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.                                                                                                        Sending waste to landfill costs twice as much as recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.Chairman of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee , Peter Argyle, said: “Clearly a signicant number of people have already given their views and as councillors we will of course take those into account when making what are important decisions about how we all deal with the waste we produce.“There are however around 118,000 households in Aberdeenshire who will be affected by these changes, so we’d be keen to have as many of their views as possible too.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie pub listed in camra good beer guide","story":"        An Inverurie pub has been acclaimed for the quality of its real ale by members of the town\u0026#8217s Campaign for Real Ale  branch.

Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Friday 28 Sep 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles. It takes two hours and 49 minutes to drive the 115 miles from Lochinver in the south-west to Wick in the north-east.\u0026ldquoMy constituency covers 3675 square miles. We could fit all 73 London constituencies in my constituency, and have room left over around the sides.\u0026ldquoThe proposed changes are simply an example of the Boundary Commission running mad and it undermines democracy.\u0026ldquoWith the best will in the world, it is very hard to cover the communities within my constituency, even when driving hither and thither.\u0026ldquoThe point is that constituencies and communities have a right of access to their elected member.\u0026ldquoDespite doing what I hope is my best,  there is a shortfall in what I can do in terms of reaching out, why would I not suggest that there is a slight democratic deficit?\u0026ldquoWhen an idea is stark raving bonkers, like this one, it just has to be said loud and clear.\u0026ldquoI will, of course, contest the seat at the next election. I may not hold the seat, as I may be voted out, but whoever represents the seat will have a very dficult time representing those good people  the constituency gets any bigger.SNP MSP Gail Ross, who holds the Holyrood seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, stated that the proposed changes were unacceptable even though they could in theory help her party to win Mr Stone\u0026rsquos seat.\u0026ldquoThat will be up to the electorate but I would rather we win a seat by having a good candidate and policies that appeal to voters than because the seat has been given extra territory, she said.\u0026ldquoI share Jamie\u0026rsquos concerns as my own ward for Holyrood is a massive challenge for me to get around it.\u0026ldquoDespite all the technology in place, such as Skype and WhatsApp, you need to visit all the parts of your constituency to see what is going on and to properly speak with constituents face to face.\u0026ldquoI have colleagues who hold seats in urban areas who are shocked by the amount of travelling I have to do to meet and listen to constituents.\u0026ldquoWe need more representation and smaller wards so that the electorate can be properly served by their MP and MSP.\u0026ldquoAs for the proposed name change of the Westminster seat to \u0026lsquoHighland North\u0026rsquo, that will see Caithness taken off the political map.\u0026ldquoIt will also be name that\u0026rsquos misleading as to how big the constituency is.

Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Friday 28 Sep 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 28, 2018 at 9:47 amThere’s plenty to see and do in Orkney, this weekend!

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, 128 tonnes of plastic bottles are incinerated every year.Here in Orkney, OIC\u0026#8217s waste team will be carrying out a number of activities including a drop-in at Tesco on Monday, visits to local schools, as well as sharing recycling information and tips on its Facebook and Twitter feeds.The team will be also be encouraging local people to take part in the Scottish Government’s national consultation on a deposit  scheme on disposable drinks containers for Scotland.OIC’s project coordination manager for waste, Jayne Venables, believes that small improvements in Orkney’s recycling rates could make a huge dference.She says for every one per cent extra material that is recycled, the council can save up to £12,500 on waste disposal costsIain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland added: “Recycle Week is the ideal opportunity to do more to make sure we’re recycling as much as we can. We all use plastic bottles in our daily routines — from shampoo and shower gel, to cleaning products —which can all be widely recycled, and it doesn’t take long to do.\u0026#8221You can also follow activity and share messages throughout the week on the Eco Active Orkney and/or OIC updates Facebook pages or using #RecycleWeekScot on Twitter.More information on deposit  and Recycling Week is available on the Zero Waste Scotland website at: www.zerowastescotland.org.uk\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotFriday 28 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgFriday 28 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

It is where direction is set, policy is \u0026#173formulated, and political leadership is given, based on the everyday lived experiences of people in workplaces, and communities right across the country.                It is the forum where ideas are exchanged and tested – and nowhere is that more the case than at conference fringe events, such as The World Transformed series, held in a brewery converted into a ­theatre space just a few miles from the main conference venue.            It is always a pleasure and a privilege to participate in this ­cauldron of ideas – and this week was no dferent. The fringe ­meeting was chaired by Ed Miliband and included economic thinkers ­Martin O’Neill and Grace Blakeley, and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.             Some of the ideas were radical, like the call to revolutionise the UK banking system. Others were reconnecting with Labour’s socialistic traditions, like economic democracy and co-operative ownership, whilst yet others looked to a future built on automation, new science and reduced and shared working time. That these ideas were aired at the conference fringe was perhaps not exceptional, that they found a ready echo in platform speeches in the main conference hall was.It was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who embraced much of this radical thinking, converting it into concrete policy proposals for an incoming Labour government. In his main address, he outlined plans to increase public ownership, including building a new frontier of worker ownership. He pledged to establish a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury. The unit will bring in external experts to advise on and implement the transfer of PFI schemes out of the private sector. That means public services will once again be owned by the public, because ­people have had enough of being ripped off by privatisation.His plans for the private sector also include action to clamp down on the industrial scale tax avoiders who are denying our hospitals, our schools and carers of the resources they need. Mobilising shareholder power to demand that companies uphold basic tax justice standards and ensuring that they meet the Fair Tax Mark standards is a central part of this approach.In a bid to rebalance power in the economy, he has outlined ­proposals to promote employee ownership in larger companies through share issues.This has some resemblance to the ideas designed by Hans Meidner in Sweden some years ago – an approach which I have championed for some time. In most European economies these ideas are mainstream – and it is a measure of how desperately our country needs real change that they are considered by some to be “left-field”.            In my main address to conference, I built on this radical thinking and applied it to Scotland, because it is clear we need Scottish solutions to Scottish problems and Scottish challenges. So, for instance, there is no Scottish Government ­industrial strategy. We need one with an enhanced role for workers and their unions in a more planned approach to the Scottish economy. Taking water back into public ownership is a pressing demand in England, but – thanks to a ­dramatic intervention by Labour in the then Strathclyde Regional Council, who famously ran a referendum to oppose water privatisation with a 71 per cent turn out and a 97 per cent rejection rate in the 1990s – we don’t need to take water into public ­ownership here. But that is not to say though that we may not need to reform the lines of its accountability and democratic oversight. One area where we ­definitely need change is on the long-standing question on the ­ownership of land. Fewer than 500 landowners own half of all private land in Scotland. To find more just land solutions means we will have to give some consideration to tax ­measures, ownership limits and residential qualications. We should certainly take the railways into public ownership, and look at the ownership and provision of bus and ferry services. With so much of our economy over dependent on overseas ownership and foreign direct investment – meaning it operates largely a branch plant – we need to look urgently at what we can do to rebalance economic ownership. One way is by taking the lead on measures like a statutory right for workers to own the company that they are employed in when it is put up for sale or facing closure. Such a boost to co-operative and employee ownership would ­relocalise ­control and lock in more local accountability.             Scotland is, after all, the birthplace of the first workers’ co-operative, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and became the home of father of the co-operative movement, Robert Owen. Rebalancing the distribution of financial instruments like regional selective assistance to target investments by indigenous rather than overseas businesses is also the right thing to do. So the idea of a world transformed is therefore central to the mainstream thinking of the party. These policy proposals are not made in the abstract, but in the real-world context of Brexit, the May Government’s failing negotiations and the growing likelihood of a UK general election in the next few months. This week, John McDonnell said: “The greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be the greater the need for change, the greater the opportunity we have to create that change, and we will.”As this week underlined, a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is up to that challenge and in Scotland the radical economic and social programme that the people need is finding new vitality and relevance.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806516.1538117697!/image/image.jpg","title":"hampden semi final decision blasted by fans and politicians","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The decision to play both Betfred Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day was described as \u0026#8220absolutely nonsensical\u0026#8221 last night as politicians joined former players in voicing safety and transport fears.                The Scottish Professional Football League  announced that Rangers would face Aberdeen at noon on Sunday, 28 October at the Glasgow stadium and Celtic would play Heart of Midlothian at 7:45pm that night.            The plan is the SPFL’s solution to a problem caused by both Glasgow clubs’ involvement in the Europa League on the previous Thursday night, which effectively ruled out the normal practice of spreading the games out over the weekend.            A full Ladbrokes Premiership fixture card in the subsequent midweek further reduced the options.Scottish Labour MSP James Kelly, who introduced a bill to scrap the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications  Act, was quick to slam the SPFL move.He said: “This is an absolutely nonsensical decision and it must be reconsidered. The idea that Hampden is equipped to cope with two 50,000 attendance games in the space of hours is bizarre. There are likely to be serious problems with transport as it takes an age to leave Hampden by public transport as it is, never mind with a hundred thousand people coming and going. Crowd safety must be paramount and the SPFL should review this with full input from the police and other bodies.”Mr Kelly’s opinion was echoed by Andrew Bowie, Scottish Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, who said the decision takes “no account whatsoever” of the fact Aberdeen fans have to get to the game and described it a “ridiculous”.He added: “A 12pm kick-off on a Sunday makes it nigh-on impossible for any Aberdeen supporters travelling by train to get to the match on time. The football authorities should give some consideration to the fans, for once. They pay hard-earned money to follow their team week in and week out. However, when it comes to showpiece events like this, they are treated as an after-thought. It is a disgrace.”            BT Murrayfield was tipped to stage one of the matches, but the league made the controversial choice to welcome four sets of fans to the national stadium on the same day following talks with the clubs and police. The SPFL stated that it was “contractually obliged to bring both semi-finals to Hampden”.SPFL secretary Iain Blair stressed he and his colleagues had to find a solution that gave Celtic and Rangers the “necessary two-day gap between competitive matches”.He said: “We’ve been working hard with police and Hampden Park on contingency planning for exactly this scenario and, together, we examined every possible permutation. The crowded fixture calendar means this is the best and most practical solution as any alternative had the knock-on effect of causing major fixture congestion, not only for Celtic and Rangers, but for several other SPFL clubs. We met with representatives of all four clubs earlier and explained that this was the only feasible outcome. The fact that both Celtic and Rangers are in Europe, and will hopefully be playing in the Europa League after the New Year, is obviously good news for Scottish football, but it does mean that our capacity for rescheduling games is signicantly curtailed. We can confirm that Police Scotland have advised the Aberdeen versus Rangers game should be played first.”Former Hearts player and BBC Scotland football pundit Allan Preston said: “We’ve got a game at quarter to eight on a Sunday night. The reaction from people I know in the game, the reaction from fans and on social media is this could potentially be one of the worst decisions that the SPFL have made. I find it ridiculous to be honest. What happens  it’s pouring with rain? What happens  the games go to extra time and penalties? How are they going to turn around the stadium – regardless there’s going to be four sets of fans in the city. It could be a volatile situation – certainly I hope not, but it could be.”            It was meanwhile announced yesterday an expert would be commissioned to review policing at football matches in Scotland. The move was confirmed at a Scottish Police Authority meeting in response to a question about a crush at Celtic Park earlier this month, but the force later said the review was not triggered by a particular incident. One supporter was taken to hospital and four were treated at the scene after the incident before an Old Firm match on 2 September.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806511.1538081106!/image/image.jpg","title":"emirates offers to fly cars to dubai on new edinburgh service","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Emirates is expected to attract well-heeled passengers to and from the capital by providing its first regular first-class cabins. They will need to be to ship a car because it will cost as much as buying a business class ticket for the route – around £3,000.Cars flown from Glasgow include an Aston Martin Cygnet bound for Cyprus as a birthday present in 2013.It was followed by two Mini Coopers sent to the Middle East for a scientic project.However, space restrictions aboard the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft that will operate between Edinburgh and Dubai mean only small cars can be accommodated.Aviation sources said larger cars were usually flown in and out of Scotland on dedicated cargo aircraft from Prestwick in Ayrshire.            Richard Jewsbury, Emirates’ isional vice-president for the UK, said: “We believe we are the only airline offering this service at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.“Transporting cars is a specialised process and is something that we do out of our Glasgow gateway on an ad hoc basis.“Customers have transported cars through our Glasgow gateway for personal reasons, such as birthday gts purchased by those visiting the country, as well as for business purposes.“Through our Dubai hub, we have the capability to transport cars from Scotland all over our global network, with recent vehicles travelling as far as South Africa and Cyprus.            “While it’s too early to know the ebbs and flow of goods being transported on our Edinburgh route yet, this is certainly an area we would like to grow across all our UK gateways.“A general cost comparison would be the price of a business class ticket booked on a similar route.”A Scottish aviation source who specialises in cargo said carrying goods on passenger aircraft was the norm.He said: “About 80 per cent is carried as ‘belly freight’ – in the normal aircraft holds.“From Scotland it can be fish, whisky – anything that fits.”            However, he said only some cars could be accommodated on passenger planes such as the Boeing 777.He said: “If it’s a tiny car, you would get it on board, but of a very restricted size.”A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: “This is an exciting opportunity and we’ll certainly be keen to work with Emirates should they wish to utilise this capability on its Edinburgh service.”Mark Johnston, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: “Since Emirates launched its Glasgow to Dubai service in 2004, it has gone on to fly millions of Scottish passengers across the \u2028globe.“People may be surprised to learn Emirates has also welcomed a number of vehicles on board, including the iconic Aston Martin.“It’s not every day we have an Aston Martin check-in for a flight, however, it simply highlights it’s not just passengers who opt to fly in style on Emirates’ Glasgow service.”Meantime, Mr Jewsbury insisted the Edinburgh route would not hold back growth of Emirates twice-daily flights from Glasgow.The airline has already reduced its Edinburgh service from daily to five days a week for much of this winter.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

In the meantime there has been an impasse in talks over funding between Highland Council and resort owners Macdonald Hotels.\nThe council has stressed it remains open to discussions and the hotel operator told the Strathy yesterday it intends to re-open the talks early next week.\nThere was a unanimous feeling at the SOS meeting that the community needs to show its support for the provision of swimming at the resort rather than wait for any resolution which may not come.\nIt was stressed that this must be in a positive manner with the emphasis put on how important access is to the pool rather than it becoming confrontational.\nPool users, HLH members and the wider public are being asked to meet at 5.30pm later today at the layby at the bottom of the resort\u0027s brae to highlight their concern over the loss of swimming.\nA big colourful banner and 500 fliers have been produced.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nFriday 28 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117758.jpg","title":"Highland search for Calum","story":"Tom Ramage\n\nPolice in Inverness are continuing with enquiries to trace Calum Anderson who has been reported missing from his home in the city.\nThe 29-year-old - also known as Malcolm - was reported missing from the Culduthel area of the city on Sunday, September 23.\nThe most recent confirmed sighting of him is at the Asda supermarket shortly after 2pm on that day.\nExtensive enquiries are ongoing to trace him and officers are urging anyone who can help to get in touch as soon as possible.\nChief Inspector James Rice said: \"As times passes we naturally grow increasingly concerned for Calum\u0026rsquos well-being.\n\"We know that he was seen at Asda in the Slackbuie area around 2pm but we have no confirmed sightings of Calum after that.\n\"Calum is known to walk extensively.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThe correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.\nBy her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.\nClearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation.

is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8645695.1537799873!/image/image.jpg","title":"go the extra mile to recycle mid and east antrim told","story":"\nMid and East Antrim Borough Council has called on all residents to join the \u0026#8220war on waste\u0026#8221 during Recycle Week, which runs from today until Friday September 28.\n\n                \nHouseholders are being encouraged to “go the extra mile” over the coming days, and to look in those forgotten rooms in the house for recyclable items, including toothpaste tubes, tissue boxes, magazines, deodorants, shampoo bottles and more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nResidents are also being reminded to check the garden shed or garage and get recyclable items down to the local household recycling centre?\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA spokesperson for Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said: “Council’s current household recycling rate is 52 per cent.

It appeared that everyone was from a small town in Northern Ireland, specically Cushendall. \n  \nA year after the reunion a note was sent to the family sharing some of the information and asking  anyone was interested in going to Cushendall. They all agreed and the family found accommodation at Glendale Bed and Breakfast in Cushendall.\n  \nAllen said: “We fell into fantastic luck in reaching the O\u0027Neill family at the Glendale Bed and Breakfast.\n  \n“Eamon and Sorcha quickly helped us find enough room for our family of 12 to spend 10 days in September under one roof. This was fantastic news for our family as we found a home base for our visit. That was just the beginning of the ways that Eamon and Sorcha went above and beyond to help our family feel at home and welcomed. \n  \n“While we did spend time enjoying the coast of Antrim, we also spent several days researching our family tree. We were quite lucky to have met up with Alan Murphy in Cushendall and he helped us with the church records to find the marriage, birth, baptism, and death records of the local church of Ireland. \n  \n“While in the church we devoured as much information as possible and found the facts about our great grandparents, and great aunts and uncles. This included finding two new Great Aunts  and a Great Uncle .\n  \n“During a separate trip to the local library we found written confirmation and the exact store fronts of our Grandmother’s father and brother along with pictures of the stores along with a picture of what appears to be our Great Grandfather sitting in his cherribanc that he would use to drive tourist in the 1930’s between Larne and Ballycastle.”\n  \nThe family also found the will of their Great Grandfather and Great Grandmother, as well as confirmation that they are from the Murphy’s of Red Bay townland, and the McFetridges that owned the stores on 6 and 8 Mill Street. \n  \n“We would have never found this information sitting behind a computer screen at our home,” Allen said.\n  \nAs well as researching their ancestry the family spent time enjoying what the area has to offer including a visit to the Giant’s Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, Dunluce Castle, Bushmills Distillery.\n  \nThey also enjoyed two separate horseback riding excursions with Shean’s Horse Farm including rides on the beach and through castle ruins, Cutting Edge Helicopter rides, Predator Sea Tours and a visit to Glenarm Castle, Ballygalley Castle and Belfast. \n  \nThe Murphy family said the community of Cushendall was “as welcoming as you will ever find anywhere in the world”.\n  \nAllen added: “Each night our family would \u0027invade\u0027 one of the Cushendall restaurants for a meal, a pub for a refreshing beverage, or one of the local stores. At every stop we were always greeted with friendly people and great conversation.\n  \n“On our last night our newly adopted Auntie Mary  took the two youngest brothers on a personal tour of Cushendall that included confirming the location of the Murphy family homestead, the location of our Great Uncle’s petrol station just outside of town, the Layde church ruins, a few back roads in the area, the house of the famous painter from Cushendall , and a few houses of her own family. \n  \n“Mary may not have known it, but we’ve adopted her and she has become one of our favourite Aunties of the Murphy’s from Montana,” he concluded.\n  \nThe Murphy family were helped in their search by Alan Murphy of Cushendall Church of Ireland who gave assistance with church records and Donnell O’Loan of Antrim Glens Tourism.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046550.jpg--.jpg?1537864027000\n","title":"ballymena rockers out to spread some joy","story":"  \nA new \u0027rocking\u0027 phenomenon is taking Ballymena by storm in the form of finding and creating little painted rocks hid around the town.\n  \n\u0027Ballymena Rocks\u0027 was born out of an idea by local woman Doreen Armstrong who became involved with \u0027Rocks NI\u0027 after finding little painted rocks around Portrush and enquiring what their purpose was.\n  \nThe idea is that people paint rocks with colour and add some words of inspiration and then hide or leave them around public places such as parks or town centres to bring a smile to the person who finds them with the \u0027Ballymena Rocks\u0027 Facebook page already having over 600 members, all creating, hiding and finding rocks around the town.\n  \nDoreen was keen to bring the practice to Ballymena after having great fun finding and creating her own rocks over the Summer in Portrush.\n  \n Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.\n  \nIt\u0027s a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.\n  \nThe craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott.

Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That is something we must all continue to confront and condemn.\n\n\"Tonight is part of the challenge to do just that. \n\n\"It\u0027s about shaping a society where everyone feels accepted, it\u0027s about building a borough where everyone believes they are valued and it\u0027s about creating a community that everyone, including our LGBT friends, can call home.\"\n\nIt\u0027s not known  Mr Smith will face any disciplinary action.\n\nThe DUP has declined to comment on the matter. The stance taken by Ards and North Down members comes three months after party leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont. \n\nShe told the LGBT community that she looked on them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\" and didn\u0027t \"define anyone on the basis of their religion, race or sexuality\".\n\nLast month, there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises.\n\nHowever, the DUP panel on Fermanagh and Omagh District Council in Mrs Foster\u0027s own constituency didn\u0027t object to lighting up Enniskillen Castle pink last month. \n\nThe Sinn Fein motion on behalf of the Rainbow Project was organised to \"demonstrate inclusivity, acceptance and welcoming to the local LGBT community\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This equates to less than 1 crossing per person each month or 0.1  trips per week.\n\nThe report shows 40% of the border crossings by NI residents went through the border at Londonderry.  \n\nThis was 34,600 crossings each weekday. Almost 20% of crossings by Northern Ireland residents went through Newry and Mourne , but only 14% of those crossings started there, with residents from other local government districts using that crossing zone as a route to the Republic.\n\nThe report shows that the majority of border crossings start and end in locations in close proximity to the border. \n\nBetween 80% and 88% of border crossings to the Republic by NI residents started in the border areas, while between 75% and 86% of all crossings by Irish residents to Northern Ireland end in border areas.\n\nSome 38% of border crossings by Northern Ireland residents on the average weekday and 26% on the average weekend day are estimated to be work-related. \n\nTherefore 62% of crossing during the week and 74% at the weekend are for social and leisure purposes. \n\nThis means that 65% of crossings over a full week are for social and leisure purposes.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They are bound by a code of conduct.\n\nThe inquiry has heard claims that some DUP spads were appointed without due process there was a hierarchy among them they were overruling ministers and they were changing documents without the knowledge of their minister.\n\nFormer DUP spad Stephen Brimstone appeared before the inquiry on Thursday to answer questions over allegations of a conflict of interest after he remained in high-level discussions about the scheme, while having applied to it.\n\nHe had served as a DUP spad in several departments before resigning in late 2016.\n\nMr Brimstone was previously in the headlines when he advised social development minister Nelson McCausland.\n\nAllegations then emerged there had been political interference in the running of the Housing Executive.\n\nA report following that probe recommended a disciplinary investigation against Mr Brimstone.\n\nBut to much negative reaction Mr McCausland decided that no further action needed to be taken against his adviser.\n\nThe inquiry’s chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said on Thursday that the rules on appointing and disciplining ministerial advisers is “one of the first things that needs to be looked at”  devolution s in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said: “Assuming the Assembly gets back, one of the first things that requires to be done is that this code needs to be looked at again in terms of whether it is or is not infringed.\n\n“The disciplinary process also has to be looked at again, it has to be looked at in terms of the experience of special advisers to date and in terms of the Northern Ireland public as a whole.\n\n“If it ever does get back into existence, that should be a priority surely.”\n\nMr Brimstone told the inquiry that he felt there is a perception that spads are “a band of iniduals just going and doing as we please”.\n\nHe said this “couldn’t be further from the truth”.\n\n“We are operating to the programme for government, we are trying to deliver on that,” he said, adding that there should be better agreed processes for special advisers to operate within.\n\nThe inquiry has heard allegations that former DUP spad Timothy Johnston was at the top of a hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDUP Councillor Jonathan Buckley with DUP adviser Timothy Johnston at Parliament Buildings in Stormont \n\n\n\n\nMr Johnston served as special adviser to former first ministers Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster from 2007 to the collapse of the Assembly in 2017.\n\nMr Brimstone told the inquiry that Mr Johnston brought expertise that secured “stable government” at Stormont.\n\nHe said “time will tell” how big his friend and former colleague’s “specialist” contribution has been.\n\n“I don’t think anyone really realises what iniduals had to go through at times in this country in order to bring a period of stable government,” he said.\n\nHe added: “This is not a simple place to do government”, claiming there had been intense “brokering” between the DUP and Sinn Fein over “even the smallest issues”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup and sf clash over reports nodeal brexit could see electricity

When the Irish government turned to the Troika to be bailed out itself, the Commission, the ECB and the IMF pushed for the privatisation of public goods and services in  as part of their general austerity programme.\n\n\"The North of Ireland also suffered from the austerity policies of the British government. The Tory government,  now propped up by the DUP was never forced by the Troika to implement austerity - they did it voluntarily.\n\n\"But people can act to defend public services. In the south of Ireland the Right2Water movement fought to keep water in public hands. In the North. Sinn Féin Minister Conor Murphy blocked in introduction of water charges. These are examples of democracy in action and we need to see more of that across the EU to continue the fight against austerity.\"\n\nPhoto - Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson speaking at the conference in Naples.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry foster mum shares story hope inspiring others","story":"\nA Derry woman who became a foster carer just over a year ago has shared her story in the hope of encouraging other people to put themselves forward.\n\nKaren , who is a nurse and a mum of two, had always wanted to foster children.\n\nAfter contacting the Western Health and Social Care Trust to find out more out more about the process she decided the time was right was her and her family.\n\n“I had been a nurse for 18 years and I wanted to do something dferent,” she explained.\n\nI had heard the radio ads about the information nights at hotels like the Everglades.\n\n“So I phoned up and asked about it and they sent out some DVDs and brochures and leaflets and I read them all and I started thinking ‘I could do that’.”\n\nKaren met with a social worker to get more information and then went on a six week course to learn more about foster caring.\n\n“They tell you about the really bad cases to prepare you. It opens your eyes to what goes on.\n\n“It’s amazing how many wains are waiting for foster care. I had no idea how many kids are in the system.\n\n“Sometimes there can be four or five children in a family who will need foster care. They try and keep them together but it’s not always possible.\n\nThe mum of two already knew a few people who had fostered and felt she had a lot to offer.\n\n“I always wanted more children but my marriage broke up when my youngest son was five months old and I’ve never had another relationship so I knew that wasn’t going to happen for me,” she said.\n\n“I feel my boys are at the right age now.\n\n“My oldest is 14 and my younger bot is 11.\n\n“It opens up their eyes to because they can see how well off they are and that not everyone gets the good start that they got.\n\n“There are dferent types of families all over the world.\n\n“They have taken to it really well.”\n\nAfter passing the necessary checks and becoming a foster carer Karen has welcomed several babies and children into her home.\n\nShe is currently looking after a little boy who has just turned four and a 13 week old baby.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nKaren decided to take a three year career break to allow her to focus on fostering, but many people do it alongside full or part time work as well.\n\n“I’m lucky that I have a good network of family around me too and my mum is very good,” she said.\n\n“If anyone was considering fostering I would say it’s challenging but it’s very rewarding.\n\n“Since I have started so many people have said to me ‘I’ve always thought about doing that’ but it puts people off that they will have a bond and then have to hand the baby back.\n\n“But that’s part of the process. You go into it knowing that and you have to be prepared.\n\n“You just take things a day at a time like you do with your own family.\n\n“I treat my foster children like I treat my own children. Everyone gets treated the same.”\n\nFoster carers can decide whether or not to have direct contact with the parents of the children in their care.\n\nKaren says she has decided to meet the parents of the children she looks after and has found it to be a positive experience.\n\n“Any parents I have had contact with have been very good there have been no bad vibes or arguments,” she explained.\n\nMany of the children who are in foster care will go on to be adopted and Karen has already had experience of this.\n\n“I had a little baby girl before last Christmas and I took her home from the hospital.\n\n“She had been in the neo natal ward for a week because she was having problems with her suck.\n\n“She was the best wain.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers. Last year, 222 homes were allocated across the district.\n\nIt was also confirmed on Monday night that 148 people are on the waiting list for social housing accommodation in Ballynahinch, with 103 in the urgent need category.\n\nIn the Castlewellan and Drumaroad area, 158 people are seeking homes, with 117 in urgent need, while 81 people are on the list for social accommodation in Killyleagh. Just under half of the applicants are in the urgent need bracket.\n\nElsewhere, the newly published figures reveal there are 77 people on the waiting list for homes in the Crossgar and Annacloy area, with 54 in urgent need.\n\nSixty two people are on the waiting list for homes in Saintfield and Ardglass, which includes Ballyhornan and Dunsford, with the urgent need figures 43 and 45 respectively.

Single, older people and small family households comprise 85% of the waiting list and the predominance of single and small family households underlines a signicant requirement for one and two bedroom homes, said the spokeswoman.\n\nShe said at the end of March this year, there were 354 social homes being constructed on site, including 140 in Newry, 30 in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe number of new homes under construction in Castlewellan and Crossgar are 34 and 20 respectively.\n\nThe Executive spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoThere are a further 451 social housing units programmed to start through the Social Housing Development Programme, with 56 social homes completed during 2017/18.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ardglass coastal clean up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA SECTION of inaccessible and rocky coastline in Ardglass was last week cleaned by volunteers with the help of local canoeists.\n\nThe clean-up \u0026mdash organised jointly by the Loch Cuain Canoe Club and the Strangford and Lecale Partnership \u0026mdash saw dozens of people show up to clean an area between the village and nearby Sheepland.\n\nCanoeists, led by local councillor Cadogan Enright, ferried the giant bags of rubbish out to waiting boats organised by the Rogers family from Portaferry who took them to Ardglass harbour.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere, they were winched up and placed in a waiting skip provided by the village\u0026rsquos harbour master, with the weekend clean-up the second such initiative to remove rubbish from inaccessible areas at the Ulster Way along the Lecale coast.\n\nLoch Cuain Canoe Club members included Joe and Gareth Fitzsimons from Ardglass, as well as Cllr Enright and his son, Cad \u0026Oacuteg, who used the occasion to highlight upcoming training courses for families wanting to get involved in canoeing locally to be held in Castleward Bay and on the Quoile River this autumn.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoAny family interested in joining in wildle or other environmental projects by canoe in the Lecale Strangford area can contact us on Facebook, said the councillor.\n\nThe weekend event attracted volunteers from the Ards peninsula as well as others from Ardglass who were joined by people from Killough, including Marty Rice and his family.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere was also a contingent from Downpatrick and Robert Hillman and Fiona Robinson from Crossgar, with the Newcastle Wild Sea Swimmers spotted collecting rubbish on shore.\n\nNewry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin thanked the volunteers for their efforts and joined them for a well earned cuppa at the harbour.\n\nCllr Enright thanked the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership\u0026rsquos Judith Caldwell for organising the day and for helping organise several other clean-ups along the Lecale Coast this year.\n\nThe coastal clean-up in Ardglass took place after 50 volunteers joined a beach clean at Tyrella the previous weekend as part of a province-wide initiative supported by volunteers and Coca-Cola employees.\n\nThe Big Beach Clean initiative involved a number of beaches including Tyrella, with Jodie McAneaney, the \u0026lsquoLive Here Love Here\u0026rsquo manager at Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, thanking all those who took part.\n\nShe said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important we educate people on protecting our marine le and our coastline it\u0026rsquos such a crucial part of our environment and also our heritage in Northern Ireland.

These articles are presently being manufactured by a workforce of seven, but  the proposed scheme swings into action a whole new range of items can be produced.\n\nAt the beginning of the year Mr Wilkin set about finding out just what local talent could produce and thus a new local industry was born in a small workshop behind the Ballynahinch shop.\n\nWhile Mr Billy Burrowes, one of the first employees of Pinewick and now a director, was trained as a joiner, the rest of the workers picked up the craft remarkably quickly.

But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working.

Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8679979.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Sir Patrick Coghlin after the Spad defended not telling the BBC the full truth of what he knew about RHI.\n\n                \nIn late 2016, the Nolan Show had asked him: “Did you or any member of your family benefit from the RHI scheme?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHis answer said that he had personally benefited from the scheme – but left out that his brother and his parents-in-law were also claimants.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone defended not answering that question fully, saying: “I didn’t feel I had to get into that [or] I was under any obligation to get into that.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe BBC also asked about a meeting between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell which Mr Brimstone says he recalls as “angry”, but he thought it had not been about RHI.\n\nThe BBC asked him: “Did you witness a heated exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell in which Arlene Foster ordered Jonathan Bell in a highly agitated manner to keep the RHI scheme open in January 2015 [actually 2016]?\n\nMr Brimstone responded to that: “No. I did not witness any such exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell.”\n\nCounsel to the inquiry Joseph Aiken asked him: “Now, is that answer accurate to the extent that you’re saying the heated exchange was not about RHI, but you’re not acknowledging ‘well, there was a heated exchange – it just wasn’t about RHI’. Do you understand the impression that might convey is simply ‘there’s no heated exchange’?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “To be honest, I was asked a question and I answered the question...the context of that question was ‘in which Arlene Foster in a highly agitated manner ordered Jonathan Bell to keep the RHI scheme open’.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked: “Were you in any way prevented from saying ‘I was present during a heated exchange, but the subject matter of that exchange was not RHI it was Bombardier and Canada?’”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “No, I wasn’t prevented from saying that.”\n\nSir Patrick said sternly: “That, according to you, is an accurate... account. Now were you in some way being inhibited because you were being talked to by the BBC? If you weren’t, why not give the full account?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “I didn’t think that they needed to know about any other matters that were being discussed at that meeting. The question was specic to the RHI scheme.”\n\nSir Patrick said the answer “could be seen as highly misleading,  what you say now is true”. He added: “You know the importance of being accurate. Why not answer that question accurately?”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “Forgive me, chair, but I do believe I answered it accurately.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “For myself, I find great dficulty in understanding why  you’re asked a question that is a very important question you don’t answer it properly. You say you did answer it properly.”\n\nMr Brimstone said he did not want to volunteer the full story in case it led to follow-up questions.\n\n                            \n            \n

\u0026#8220didn\u0026#8217t seem odd\u0026#8221 to him that he could use a boiler in an outbuilding to claim a lucrative non-domestic RHI subsidy, even though the boiler was overwhelmingly used to heat his home.\n\n                \nOn a second day of evidence at the RHI Inquiry, Stephen Brimstone frequently looked uncomfortable as he explained his involvement with the scheme, even though the inquiry has already said his use of the boiler is consistent with normal use rather than wasteful practice.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone, left, pictured before the inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe veteran DUP Spad defended what he had done and insisted that he had acted properly – with the exception of failing to formally declare an interest when the issue was being discussed in Stormont.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe inquiry heard how there were two complaints – one in May 2016 and another in October of that year – which alleged Mr Brimstone was fraudulently heating his house on the non-domestic RHI scheme on the premise that he had an agricultural shed. The first complaint said: “The shed is no more agricultural than he is”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe initial inspection by Ofgem, which runs the scheme, raised a series of concerns, with the inspector suspicious about what was going on after he found children’s toys, a pile of wood for the indoor fire, a tractor and work tables in the ‘agricultural shed’, which seemed more like a big garage.\n\nHowever, after a protracted investigation during which his payments were stopped Ofgem ultimately concluded that Mr Brimstone’s shed was able to be classied as agricultural and he was properly on the scheme.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Nolan\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nInquiry barrister Joseph Aiken said that Ofgem’s explanation for why it was possible for Mr Brimstone to legally be on the scheme raised other questions about the scheme.\n\nHe said that the logic of Ofgem’s interpretation of the rules was such that  someone were to ask a farmer to bring their sheep into their shed for one day a year and for the rest of the year there was no agricultural activity in the building it would be possible to use the non-domestic RHI scheme to put a boiler in the shed, run a pipe to the nearby house, and heat the home year-round.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut despite the authorities saying it was technically possible to do what Mr Brimstone did , he faced robust questioning over his decision to use the non-domestic scheme.\n\nDame Una O’Brien put it to Mr Brimstone “the clue is in the name – it’s a non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive scheme”.\n\nShe asked him: “When it became apparent to you that it was possible to do this – you know, admittedly, within the rules – did it never occur to you to say ‘Hmm, I wonder  this was really ever intended? Is this right? Should I raise this with Dr Crawford? Should I raise this with the department, and really point out to them that there’s a whole group of potential applicants that don’t appear to be non-domestic who could get into this scheme?’\n\n“Did it occur to you to say ‘This is a bit odd’?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone paused before saying: “It didn’t, and probably my understanding of the scheme – limited as it was, because obviously I had looked into aspects of the scheme – but my understanding of the scheme was that up until July 2015, mid-July 2015, I wasn’t aware that there was a dferentiation for example on the tarf between the GB scheme and the Northern Ireland scheme.”\n\nDame Una said: “But you were aware that a domestic scheme had been launched in Northern Ireland, so there was a non-domestic scheme and then a domestic scheme was launched.”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “Yes.”\n\nDame Una put it to him: “And you knew that the domestic scheme of that title offered a less generous incentive.”\n\nThe former Spad said: “Yes.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDame Una continued: “You were very close to the centre of government. You were in a position where you could potentially have pointed this out more explicitly, given that you’d done the research and got to the nub of it really.”\n\nAfter a long pause, Mr Brimstone said: “The intent behind the scheme, from my understanding, was that Europe had placed particular targets on the UK Government to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions and my understanding was that this scheme was a way to encourage people to...move away from traditional fossil fuels to biomass and other technologies, renewable technologies.\n\n“So yes, maybe I should have – but my understanding at that point was literally that this was a good scheme to really encourage people to move away, whatever the situation was. \n\n“And yes, they did introduce a domestic scheme. But my view was that was to allow a scheme for homes and towns and cities and the countryside to also avail of this scheme to reduce their CO2 emissions.”\n\nHighlighting that Mr Brimstone was primarily heating a domestic property under the non-domestic scheme, Dr Keith MacLean said: “That was primarily what you were doing.”\n\nThe former Spad said: “Yeah. Yeah, exactly.”\n\nHe went on to add both schemes had “the same purpose” but that he could not heat his shed, as well as his house, on the domestic scheme.\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin said that he could have “gone back to your electric heater – which you had done for some years”, prompting a smile from Mr Brimstone.\n\nMr Brimstone said that when Arlene Foster became First Minister he had informed her he had applied to the scheme. He said that he had done so when she was appointed First Minister in January 2016 and she appointed him as one of her Spads.\n\nWhen asked how Mrs Foster had reacted to the news, he said: “I suppose she just thanked me for telling her. I think she asked ‘are you happy that everything’s OK with it?’ and I would have said ‘yes, my belief is that everything’s OK with the application’ and that was the end of the matter.”\n\nWhen asked  it was discussed that the declaration of interest should be formalised by putting it in writing, he said: “No. That wasn’t the way it would have worked. You would have had conversations amongst each other.\n\n“Other than a letter of resignation or a letter of appointment – that was [sic] the sorts of things you put in writing to each other.”\n\nAlluding to the dearth of documentary evidence about key elements of the RHI timeline, barrister Joseph Aiken said sardonically: “I think the inquiry has worked that out.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin said: “In some ways, someone could form an even more serious view... you tell the first minister you have an interest, and having done that you then continue to be involved. And that can play back on the genuineness of your declaration - you’re just doing it for form.\n\n“You may shake your head and so on, but that is the sort of perspective somebody might adopt. That’s why it’s so important.”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “I appreciate that, chair...I should have stepped back from every instance [of RHI discussion in government], and yes every instance makes the thing even worse.”\n\nThe inquiry’s technical assessor, Keith MacLean, said: “It sounds that it goes beyond your judgement as well - you’ve told Mrs Foster, you’ve told Mr Johnston and none of the three of you have come to a conclusion or had a discussion about the need to do something formally and for you to withdraw.”\n\nSir Patrick said that “the other dficulty” is that all of this was happening at the very top of government, among three people in the first minister’s office.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

Another option is to present changes in personal well-being over time within the same local authority area, identying signicant changes.\n\n\nWider findings\n\nThe report found that the happiest place to live in the UK is apparently an area of north-east Hampshire called Rushmoor, which scored 8.35 out of 10. The UK average was 7.7.\n\nOverall Northern Ireland continued to report the highest average le satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness ratings, and the lowest anxiety ratings, when compared with the UK and the other constituent countries of the UK.\n\nCommenting on the figures, Silvia Manclossi, head of the ONS Quality of Le Team, said: \"An important part of our work is looking beyond the economic health of the country to how its people are faring and inequalities in society.\n\n\"Today, for the first time, we have identied how factors such as health, access to services, and crime levels may affect how people rate their well-being in dferent parts of the UK. This can help local authorities and other organisations to better understand where services could be targeted to help improve the well-being of people in their area.”\n            \n    \n    try

submissions sent to Mrs Foster while she was the minister responsible for RHI \u0026#8211 and he attempted to cover his tracks by instructing that the documents should only be requested over the phone rather than by email, which would leave a written record.\n\n                \nThe then Spad also used private DUP email addresses, rather than departmental accounts, meaning that the communication would not have been discoverable under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nTimothy Johnston of the Democratic Unionist Party in September 2017\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEvidence published last night by the RHI Inquiry ahead of Mr Johnston’s appearance before it today suggests private DUP concern at the time.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCommunications obtained by the inquiry show that around July 4, 2016, the day before the Audit Office report which first exposed the scale of the RHI overspend, Mr Johnston urgently sought from the then-minister responsible for the scheme, Simon Hamilton, and his Spad, John Robinson, “all submissions that were put to Arlene on the RHI scheme by DETI [her old department]”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHe went on to say that “we need this material discreetly today and when asking for it do so by phone call and not email”.\n\nThe inquiry asked Mr Johnston in writing why he had done so.\n\nHe said: “I wanted all relevant documents to try to establish what material had been submitted to the First Minister  to provide an accurate record so that any comments and statements that were publicly issued in the aftermath of the NI Audit Office Report were in fact accurate. I recall this being part of a fact checking exercise of which the FM would have been aware.”\n\nThe inquiry asked Mr Johnston why he wanted the matter dealt with in a way that would not leave a trail.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said: “I wanted the matter treated ‘discreetly’ because at that point I did not want it to become clear that we really were not aware of what were the facts during the period in question. I did not want it becoming clear that we had commenced a process of fact checking.”\n\nWhen asked why he used party email accounts – rather than official government email addresses – for the communication, Mr Johnston said: “This was my practice for all of my period as a special advisor as I did not have access to official documents outside of office hours and I never adopted the procedure of using two phones. My department and ministers all knew that had always been the case.”\n\nPressed by the inquiry on why Spads and ministers “engaged in behaviour that was designed to avoid the creation of written records of their actions and what the reasons for such behaviour were”, Mr Johnston denied that there was “a general practice of behaving in a way of avoiding written records”.\n\nHowever, he accepted that there were “many occasions when discussions between minister and advisors would not have been recorded”, adding that “the vast bulk of meetings between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on how to resolve dficult political issues within government were rarely documented”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said that “Sinn Fein in particular were keen to exclude officials from meetings. Sometimes that was appropriate but on many other occasions it was not”.\n\nThere is also evidence which backs up allegations that Mr Johnston had a senior role among Spads and acted as an ‘enforcer’.\n\nA message released by the inquiry shows that the Executive’s top spin doctor, David Gordon, sent an email in which he advised that a query from the BBC about the RHI scheme should be responded to with “a shorter statement, plus a scary TJ [Timothy Johnston] call to Nolan might be in order”. When asked what precisely was meant by “a scary TJ call to Nolan”, Mr Johnston simply said: “A call that would set out the FM and DUP version of events up to that point.”\n\nMr Johnston said it was “not unusual” for the DUP and Sinn Fein to deliberately keep issues from being discussed at the Executive to keep them away from the smaller parties.\n\n                            \n            \n
