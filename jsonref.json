It is a fate worse than death.\u0027The conniving candidate also makes promises that go against her Democratic platform to get endorsements from congressmen, telling one that she\u0027ll increase the amount of land available for oil drilling and another that she\u0027ll outlaw same sex marriage. When her lesbian daughter Catherine (Sarah Sutherland) expresses outrage at that second promise, Selina replies: \u0027It\u0027s just the party platform, it\u0027s like a to-do list of things we\u0027re not going to do.\u0027          Selina\u0027s campaign adviser Kent Davison (Gary Cole) and former chief of staff Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) are seen trying to convince her not to pick Jonah Ryan to be her VP. She responds by railing against the position she previously held, telling them : \u0027Being vice president is like being declawed, defanged, neutered, ball-gagged and sealed in an abandoned coal mine under two miles of human s***. It is a fate worse than death\u0027Perhaps Selina\u0027s largest hurdle is an investigation into the Meyer Fund, which her husband Andrew (David Pasquesi) was stealing money from using checks in her name. His scheme appears to be seconds from going public, threatening to ruin her chances and making the White House. Just before Selina goes on stage to accept her nomination, one of her advisers warns her that \u0027someone will have to go down\u0027 for the Meyer Fund. She says: \u0027I know\u0027 with an unnerving smile that makes it clear she\u0027s found a fall guy. Sadly, but not surprisingly, that fall guy is Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) the ever-loyal minder who has been by her side constantly. Though Gary can read Selina\u0027s mind in many situations, like when she\u0027s hungry or needs hand sanitizer, he doesn\u0027t see this one coming. He is standing on the edge of the stage offering Selina her favorite lipstick when she begins to tell him what she\u0027s done - before he interrupts her to pick a chia seed out of her teeth. Selina ends up just saying \u0027nevermind\u0027 with a shrug as she takes the stage to accept her nomination. While she\u0027s at the microphone she looks to the side to see a blindsided Gary being arrested by FBI agents.            One of the many schemes Selina orchestrated to seal her place in the Oval Office involved making her ever-loyal aide Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) take the fall for her husband\u0027s fraud         Selina winces on stage at the Democratic National Convention as she stands in front of the crowd with her disastrous new running mate Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons)It\u0027s not until the last seven minutes that the episode feels like a finale. After the nomination scene the story skips ahead six months to see Selina settled into the Oval Office.  Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw) is back to being Selina\u0027s brutally blunt receptionist, just as she was in earlier seasons.  When Jonah shows up looking to speak with Selina, Sue makes it clear in very few words that that\u0027s not going to happen. Seeing the vice president stand outside the Oval Office unable to get a minute with the president feels full-circle.  The next scene shows Selina in her office with her two top aides, her former campaign manager Bob Bradley (Martin Mull) and James\u0027 former campaign manager Michelle. She gripes about being hungry before calling out for Gary, who is presumably in prison. Bob reminds her that Gary isn\u0027t there and offers to get her something to eat. When he asks what she wants, Selina snaps: \u0027You figure that out\u0027 - something only Gary was ever able to do. The two aides leave the room and we see Selina\u0027s face fall as she realizes she\u0027s alone, having alienated everyone who helped get her into the White House. The moment doesn\u0027t last long - this is a comedy, after all.           The series flashes forward six months to show Selina sitting in the Oval Office and realizing she is all alone after driving everyone in her life awayThe final four or so minutes of the show take place 24 years in the future in 2044, just after Selina\u0027s death.   Reporting on the late president\u0027s funeral procession on TV is Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh). Having failed miserably in that role and struggled early on in his subsequent journalism career, a graying Mike appears to have finally hit his stride.  He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and made good on her promise to outlaw same sex marriage.          Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock is anchoring the news during the late president\u0027s funeral. He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and outlawed same sex marriageNext we see many of the core characters reunite at Selina\u0027s funeral, including several of her political rivals. Through Mike\u0027s newscast we learn that the current president is Richard Splett (Sam Richardson), the bumbling political aide who helped run Selina\u0027s campaign, despite her protestations.  Amy is happily married to campaign manager Bill Ericsson (Diedrich Bader) and is the proud mother to greyhounds. She catches up with an overly-botoxed and tanned Dan Egan (Reid Scott), now married to a 20-something blonde. Both Amy and Dan are shocked to see that Gary showed up for the funeral even though Selina apparently never visited him in prison. He places her favorite lipstick on her casket and whispers: \u0027You would hate these flowers.\u0027   We see Jonah watching the funeral from home, griping to his wife slash step-sister that he\u0027s glad he wasn\u0027t there. She responds that its a good thing he got impeached so they didn\u0027t have to invite him.  Catherine is also watching from home and celebrating being free from her judgmental and absent mother. Catherine\u0027s ex-Secret Service agent lover Marjorie Palmiotti (Clea DuVall) tells her now-grown son that \u0027losing a parent is hard\u0027 before the not-so-grieving daughter saunters in with a tray of margaritas and a big grin.          Gary showed up to Selina\u0027s funeral 24 years after she betrayed him even though she never visited him in prison.

I\u0027m not wishing that, I\u0027m saying anything could happen.\u0027 The spectacular overshadowing is a fitting end for Veep\u0027s bitter and battled anti-hero, who surely thought she deserved a much grander sendoff.             As the credits start rolling on one side of the screen, Mike comes back on and begins paying tribute to Selina before receiving breaking news that actor Tom Hanks has died at the age of 88"},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible photographs reveal experiences brave WWII pilots","story":"Share this article On 26 May 1940, Churchill ordered the start of Operation Dynamo - the evacuation of more than 330,000 Allied troops from the beaches of Dunkirk during WWII.RAF Fighter Command began to operate patrols from Boulogne to Dunkirk and the operations were to continue for the next nine days during the evacuation.They suffered heavy losses, but over 800 small boats volunteered to help bring 330,000 troops home, the RAF stoically performed their duty of protecting the shores and providing shelter over the evacuation.         One of the most iconic images of the summer of 1940 shows three of the squadron\u0027s Spitfires in formation during the struggle to rescue thousands of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk. At the head of the section is Flight Lieutenant Ellis in DW-0, Sergeant Arnfield in DW-K and Flight Officer Warner in DW-Q         On 30 August 1940, a day in which the RAF\u0027s Fighter Command flew 1,054 sorties, two German Me 109s collided near Biggen hill. Both pilots successfully bailed out and survived. Some of 610 Squadron\u0027s men wen to inspect the remains of the aircraft. On the left is Brian Rees who had not flown since 22 August. Next to him, holding a piece of a 109 is Peter Lamb, who shot down a Heinkel 111 that day. On the right is John Ellis, complete with polka dot silk scarf and the Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon below his wings         This photograph was taken at RAF Acklington, in Northumberland, between 17-19 September 1940. John Ellis proudly sits on top of the engine of his plane, while his colleagues stand proudly in front. September saw the Luftwaffe begin their campaign to bomb key British cities, which was known as \u0027The Blitz\u0027         Several Boulton Paul Defiants, a lesser-known aircraft which was used during the War, are seen on patrol with 141 Squadron. The Defiant was effective at destroying bombers during combat but it was vulnerable during daytime because it did not have forward-firing weapons          The non-flying members of the RAF, the ground crew, kept the planes in the air by fixing and maintaining them. As soon as the Spitfires had landed, crew members would swarm all over them to check for damage and to refuel and rearm them. Due to the hard work of both pilots and ground crew, Britain was able to stand firm in 1940 against fearsome oddsThe 610 Squadron then played a key role in the Battle of Britain, claiming a heavy toll on the Luftwaffe while operating from Biggin Hill and Hawkinge.Against dire odds, the British RAF managed to contain and fight off the Luftwaffe during months of gruelling aerial warfare.         Mr Bailey said he wanted to offer a \u0027fascinating insight into the squadron\u0027s history\u0027 from its formation in 1936 to its courageous actions at Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain Due to the hard work of The Few - supported by the many on the ground - Britain was able to stand firm in 1940 and eventually launch the counter attack four years later which would see the Allied Forces defeat the Third Reich. Mr Bailey said \u0027In terms of facts and figures in 1940, 610 Squadron had lost twenty-two pilots killed or \u0027missing, fourteen or fifteen wounded and five ground crew killed and at least two wounded, in the eight months since Germany unleashed its Blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940. They were terrible casualties indeed.\u0027The Squadron had made claims for sixty-eight aircraft destroyed, seventeen unconfirmed, nineteen probably destroyed, and twenty-four damaged Luftwaffe aircraft, 128 claims in total. \u0027These statistics are evidence of the heroic effort made by the Squadron in defence of the Army and Navy at Dunkirk, and then the nation as a whole during the Battle of Britain.\u0027However, there is so much more to the history of 610 Squadron than such stark figures, and hopefully this book has given a greater insight into the lives, and all too frequent deaths, of the people who made up \u0027The Chesters\u0027.\u0027In Britain\u0027s greatest hour of need, the pilots and ground crew were willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice in order to maintain our freedom against the tyranny of Nazi Germany.\u0027The valiant and courageous actions of 610 (County of Chester) Auxiliary Air Force Squadron\u0027s personnel, should never be forgotten.\u0027David Bailey\u0027s 610 (County of Chester): Auxiliary Air Force Squadron 1936-1940 is published by Fonthill Media.

But the star endured a difficult childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriageAlthough she made 39 films and many TV shows, she is best remembered for a song — Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) — which she belted out to James Stewart in the Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much. Years later, Day liked to say \u0027Que Sera, Sera\u0027 to fend off intrusive questions about a personal life that was the opposite of the sparkling romances of her films.Although her wholesome, sunny image was a construct of her Hollywood advisors — the pianist Oscar Levant once quipped: \u0027I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin\u0027 — she didn\u0027t want to disappoint fans and she played along for years.She was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in a German neighbourhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 3, 1922 — and suffered an unhappy childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriage. Her father was a professional musician who hated popular songs — and to bait him, Day\u0027s mother would get the little girl to perform a song he particularly loathed.         Her third husband Marty Melcher was a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future filmsAs a young child, she caught her father with another woman, creeping into a bedroom during a party at their home. She recalled crying herself to sleep listening to them. \u0027I heard him and I heard her,\u0027 she said.From her childhood onwards, Doris said she dreamed of being the perfect wife with a perfect husband. It\u0027s possible she just tried too hard — at least two of her husbands would blame her for the break-up of their relationships while a third would say she was too exhausting to keep up with.Doris was encouraged by her mother to become a dancer but such ambitions were shattered when, aged 13, she was involved in a terrible car accident. The car, driven by a friend after a pahurty, became stuck on the rails at a level crossing and was crushed by an oncoming train. One of Doris\u0027s legs was crushed and she spent over a year on crutches.         The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romanceShe turned to singing instead. A local bandleader, Barney Rapp, gave her a job and her stage name after hearing her sing \u0027Day By Day\u0027. Doris was just 17 when she fell in love with trombonist Al Jorden who helped her with her singing. They married when she was 19.Jorden immediately showed a dark side to his character when he punched her on their wedding night, the first of many beatings. When she became pregnant, he insisted that she have an abortion. When she refused, he hit her in the stomach in the hope that she would lose their baby.She didn\u0027t, although by the time their son, Terry, was born, she had managed to flee her brutal and paranoid husband.For all her dreams of being the perfect wife, Doris was hardly the perfect mother. She soon went back on the road with her band and left her mother, Alma, to bring up her son. Terry — her only child — would later say that \u0027mother\u0027 was a word for him that had no meaning. \u0027My grandmother was my total parent,\u0027 he explained.         Ol\u0027 Blue Eyes: The iconic actress had on-screen magic in Young at Heart in 1965 with Frank SinatraDoris married second husband, George Weidler, a saxophonist, when she was 22. They lived in a trailer park and the marriage lasted just eight months. It was significant chiefly for Weidler introducing her to Christian Science — a faith notorious for hostility to modern medicine and its insistence that believers should heal themselves through prayer.Day would say of Weidler: \u0027We had a strong physical attraction for each other, but I didn\u0027t realise that it takes much more than that to make a marriage work.\u0027Even after they split up, they would occasionally reunite for bouts of passionate sex — behaviour that could not be more different from her screen persona and which fulfilled a need she never denied she had for physical relationships.She was also rumoured to have had an affair with Bob Hope — who she met frequently because Hope\u0027s musical director Les Brown was Doris\u0027s bandleader. Hope nicknamed her \u0027Jut Butt\u0027, explaining: \u0027You could play bridge on her ass.\u0027         Co-stars such as Kirk Douglas were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027Without any acting experience, Doris got her big Hollywood break when director Michael Curtiz — looking for an \u0027All-American Girl\u0027 —- cast her in the 1948 romantic comedy musical It\u0027s Magic.He spent most of the time during her screen test wiping away her tears. It was Curtiz who dubbed Day \u0027Miss Lachrymose\u0027 for her uncanny ability to cry on demand. Equally useful was her ability to memorise a script after reading it just once. The film instantly established Doris as a star at 26 and also set in stone — as far as Hollywood publicists were concerned — her image as squeaky clean. Co-stars were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027.Doris often played singers and hated lip-syncing so she usually sang live on the set.In 1951, aged 29, she married third husband Marty Melcher, a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future films. He was loathed in Hollywood, where he was known as \u0027Mr Day\u0027 for continually interfering in her career, making impossible demands that were usually for himself rather than her.He pressured her into making various films she had no interest in making, and turning down parts —such as the \u0027older woman\u0027 in The Graduate, that she wanted.         Doris, pictured with co-star Ronald Reagan, never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbolThey fought at work and in their private life. After he followed her into Christian Science, she complained bitterly that the faith became more important to him than their marriage.Christian Science almost proved the death of Doris while she was shooting the 1956 film Julie.Because of their shared religious faith, Melcher refused to let her see a doctor for weeks after she started haemorrhaging for what turned out to be an intestinal tumour.Eventually, she did see a doctor and had to have a hysterectomy. Decades later, Day — who returned to Christian Science in later life — would alarm friends concerned by her increasing frailty by baulking at taking even an aspirin.She left Melcher at least once but confided to friends that she needed —more than he did — the sexual side of their marriage. The star only learned Melcher had swindled her out of her £15 million fortune — leaving with her with debts of around £350,000 — after he died in 1968. He had also signed her up to a five-year contract for a TV series, The Doris Day Show, that she\u0027d known nothing about — although she accepted the part and it became a huge hit.Doris was charged with fraudulently trying to evade income tax and the allegation was only thrown out of court when she proved she\u0027d known nothing about what her husband had been up to.In the end she had a nervous breakdown — one symptom of which was when she ed fully clothed into a friend\u0027s swimming pool — but she eventually won $22 million (£17 million) in damages from Melcher\u0027s attorney and other associates who had mismanaged her money.In 1976, she married for the fourth time, to restaurateur Barry Comden. This time, Day studiously kept their marriage out of the limelight, not even mentioning him in her Who\u0027s Who entries, let alone allowing him to be photographed with her. However, they, too, ended up orcing six years later.All she could say was \u0027it is better that we live apart\u0027 while Comden claimed: \u0027She kicked me out of bed to make room for her animals.\u0027Doris had by then retired from showbusiness and public life, devoting her time to her pets and stray animals. She became known locally as deeply eccentric (although when a newspaper dubbed her a mad \u0027bag lady\u0027, she successfully sued). She would drive her own animal ambulance to a spot where she heard a dog or cat had been run over to care for it, and would appear in supermarkets counting out her discount coupons as she loaded up on pet supplies.She opened an animal hospital and turned her huge home over to her pets, serving them gourmet food and tucking dozens of cats and dogs into specially-made beds at night. Many dogs would pile on to her own kingsize bed.Doris never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbol. James Garner, who co-starred with her in two films, once described her as \u0027a very sexy lady who doesn\u0027t know how sexy she is\u0027.She largely cut herself off from her old life, not even attending her son\u0027s funeral when he died of cancer in 2004. Staff who looked after her complained she could be miserly and demanding, not even giving a former PA who broke a front tooth opening a pack of food the money to go to the dentist.In her later years, all but a handful of her smaller pets had to go as her carers grew terrified one might knock her over and kill her.The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romance. When she launched her last TV show — about dogs — in 1985, Hudson was at the press conference.She was stunned by his shattered physical appearance but, having no idea he had Aids, Doris reassured everyone he just had flu. Hudson died soon afterwards.The star once nicknamed The Virgin Queen for the purity of her roles went into hiding for weeks, spending most of the time doing what she always did so well: crying."},{"url":null,"title":"Students clash hijab Tehran University","story":"Share this article Fars news agency, which is close to ultra-conservatives, said scuffles broke out between the protesters and other students who supported compulsory hijabs. They \u0027were shouting slogans against attire laws and observance of hijab,\u0027 Ali Tolouie, the head of Tehran University Student Basij Organisation, told Fars. Mr Tolouie declared that the protesters\u0027 statement \u0027shows they are against Islam itself\u0027. There were no reports of any casualties or arrests.

Photograph: iStockShane gleefully volunteering to go bag-packing to raise funds for the rugby team was the last straw.Ironically, when the coach came to the classroom looking for volunteers, Shane was busy writing all the homework he had missed recently into his homework journal. He has taken photographs of the missed notes, as he will need one long, uninterrupted stretch of study time to go through them. Due to our school’s recent success in GAA, rugby and basketball, I have hardly seen Shane. He really isn’t that bothered though. Even though he is only in attendance for the third time in the last four weeks, he’s visibly over the moon at the opportunity to escape the classroom again and go out fundraising. She spent yesterday’s breaktime with me trying to understand the new and complex material she has missed recently. She’s an asset to her hockey, GAA and basketball teams, and all three have progressed to the later stages of their various leagues and competitions. She is an industrious student who would very much prefer not to have missed so many classes. When she was showing the strain yesterday, I asked her why she didn’t just relieve some of the pressure by narrowing her choice of extra-curricular activities. She admitted she would love to, but would feel as though she were letting her team down if she quit. Despite playing some of those sports with clubs outside school too, she feels a genuine camaraderie and team spirit with all three school teams and cannot bear to choose between them. Extra-curricular work is invaluable, but it must never come at a cost to the curricular work or to the child’s overall wellbeing. Promoting how talented a student is at a sport and how much you are doing for him by training him and bringing him to matches, only makes sense if you aren’t creating curricular problems for him. He will still have to take his exams, and it is a teacher’s responsibility to ensure that when the time comes, it won’t be a more traumatic experience as a result of time missed while away. It can be hard to wear a coach’s hat and a teacher’s hat at one and the same time, but part of involvement in such extras is teaching the students how to achieve good balance in their lives, and enabling them to find strategies to attend training and matches without accumulating a burden of missed schoolwork. Cannot do everythingLike everything else on a school campus, this area of school life simply needs careful managing. As adults, we learn very quickly that we cannot do everything and we must choose and prioritise. We must weigh up options and make informed decisions. These impact on others, and will sometimes be welcome and very popular with our circle, be it personal or professional. Other decisions will be less well received, whether it is reneging on a work commitment or turning down a social engagement. One of the eight key skills which underpin the new Junior Cycle is “managing myself”, and main elements are identified as knowing myself, making considered decisions, setting and achieving goals. Surely there is no better way to ease the pupils into this necessary life skill than by actively engaging them in a thorough analysis of their weekly school timetable and commitments. It’s an excellent practical exercise to ask them to assess how capable of it they are and if it is sustainable in their inidual circumstances. Going through this process may well involve students such as Shane and Laura consciously choosing and committing to three sports teams. Some students simply do not thrive on academic work, and their enthusiasm for school may well be driven by what it can offer in terms of other activities, which are in themselves learning situations. If Pupil A is at risk of school refusal or dropping out entirely and a high proportion of sporting activities keeps him in school, then isn’t a school week packed with extra-curricular activities the best option for him? If Pupil B has learning difficulties and struggles to keep up even while attending every class, how is it to his advantage to miss time unless this is unavoidable? I meet many parents who are taken aback by how many lessons their child has missed as a result of matches, despite surely knowing that school carries on as normal when only small portions of a class are away. Can they not connect the dots and see that a child playing for three school teams attends a significantly lower proportion of the year’s lessons than a child who confines their sporting commitments to local clubs? There is no better or right way here. What works for your child is what is better or right, whatever the profile of their week. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula. Commitment and collaboration are just two examples of qualities which are essential in an enriching workplace and best acquired through practice. It’s hard to argue that these skills can be learned any better in a classroom than on a sports field. The merits of the time on the sports field are therefore not in dispute here I am merely questioning any inidual’s capacity to juggle everything on offer without occasionally dropping a ball. Iniduals struggle when overloaded, hence the importance of managing oneself. The new Junior Cycle theory on this is sound, and achieving the correct curricularextra-curricular balance presents a fantastic opportunity for a practical and meaningful life lesson.

A thoroughbred horse previously bought for £240,000, with past links to a famous Irish trainer and to a stud farm owned by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, was found abandoned and nearly starved to death in a Cork barn.War Celeste, now a seven-year-old mare, was bred from a United States-based stallion called War Front, who commands a current stud fee of $250,000 (€222,500).Last year, the horse was found abandoned alongside 10 others, in a farm barn. The thoroughbred horse was emaciated, with its ribcage showing, and in such poor condition euthanising the animal was considered.Four of the horses, including War Celeste, were discovered locked into stable pens. In one stable horses were found standing on a mound of excrement several feet high. The other seven horses were found by an animal welfare charity elsewhere on the farm, left without access to hay or adequate water.At least three of the 11 horses had to be euthanised due to the condition they were recovered in. Two dogs in poor condition and a number of cats were also found at the farm.War Celeste has since been nursed back to health by My Lovely Horse Rescue, whose volunteers initially discovered the abandoned animals.Horse-racing clubThe horse was originally bought for £240,000 in 2013 by a horse-racing club, China Horse Club. Preparation for the auction sale was done by a Watership Down stud farm, which is owned by musical composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.After the sale the horse was moved to Ireland to be trained as a racehorse. At one point it was trained by famous Co Tipperary trainer David Wachman, who retired in 2016. However, the horse never raced, and was later sold as a brood mare, which is a horse used for breeding, in 2015.This was the last registered sale of the horse at auction, bought from the horse racing club for £15,000 by a bloodstock agent. It is unclear how the horse later came to reside on the Co Cork farm.Maddie Doyle, a volunteer with My Lovely Horse Rescue, said the charity regularly deals with cases of animals found in bad condition. “This case is probably one of the worst we’ve ever witnessed,” she said.The horses locked in stables “hadn’t seen daylight in a long time”, and had been without care for “at least weeks and weeks”, she said. The animals were emaciated, with overgrown feet, and later difficulties moving due to their confinement, Ms Doyle said.People were “uncomfortable” talking about cases where thoroughbred horses were abandoned, due to the significance of the horse-racing industry, she said.China Horse Club was set up by Teo Ah Khing, a wealthy architect, entrepreneur and racehorse enthusiast. A spokesman for the club said the animal was sold in “great condition” in 2015, and it was “disheartening” to learn of its abandonment.Gardaí in Cork are investigating the abandonment of the animals, and a Garda spokesman said officers were pursuing a “definite line of inquiry.”Gardaí are investigating a single suspect who had previously run the farm but is since believed to have left the country, one local Garda source said.Department of Agriculture veterinary inspectors seized the horses shortly after they were discovered, and several have been rehomed with rescue charities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3891247.1557785195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"commission to recommend pay rise for defence forces staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Public Service Pay Commission is likely to propose increases in military service allowances for Army personnel  and to patrol duty allowances for Naval Service members, sources said. Photograph: Alan BetsonIncreased take-home pay for members of the Defence Forces is likely to be recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission when it reports to the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe today.The commission, an independent body tasked by the Government with examining pay in the public sector, is expected to make its report on Defence Forces pay and the challenges of recruitment and retention of staff in the armed forces available to Mr Donohoe today.It is likely that the report will be brought to Cabinet next week with a recommendation that the pay increases be approved. These are in addition to basic pay, it is understood.Sources say the commission was likely to propose increases in military service allowances for personnel in the Army and to patrol duty allowances for members of the Naval Service.In addition, the commission is understood to have been looking closely at the reintroduction of a loyalty bonus for pilots in the Air Corps to persuade them to remain in military service. Many pilots have left the Air Corps to work for commercial airlines, leading to personnel shortages. A similar “service commitment scheme” for pilots which saw some personnel receive additional payments of up to €22,000 per year on top of salary was withdrawn a number of years ago.While official sources were tight-lipped last night, it is expected that the patrol duty allowance, currently payable at €48 per day to naval personnel at sea, would be increased to the levels paid before the financial crisis when they stood at about €53 to €55 per day depending on rank.The military service allowance, which currently ranges from €42-€123 per week, is also set to be increased.CampaignThe pay increases for military personnel come after a campaign by families and relatives of Defence Forces personnel, and have been supported by Opposition parties in the Dáil.Numbers in the Defence Forces have continued to fall despite recent recruitment campaigns. The full strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps combined should be a minimum of 9,500 personnel but has now fallen below 8,500 the lowest point since numbers were increased in the 1970s in response to the Troubles erupting.The increases also come after a pay deal with nurses and signals from Ministers at union conferences over the Easter period that the Government was willing to consider requests for specific concessions on pay and pensions.Minister for Health Simon Harris told doctors he would look at a new process to end the two-tier pay system, a move estimated to cost the exchequer €40 million.Minister for Education Joe McHugh told teachers that remaining issues on recent-entrant pay would be given “full consideration” either as part of a new pay review in the public service or in talks on a successor to the existing overall public-service pay agreement.The softening of the Government’s position on public-sector pay has also been signalled to the general public-service unions such as Fórsa, the largest union representing public servants, which recently said it would seek the restoration of a shorter working week.Unions are also pushing for a midterm review of the public-sector pay agreement later this year, which could open the door to further pay concessions.Meanwhile, Government sources have played down expectations that workers on community employment (CE) schemes will be granted access to public-sector pensions.Workers on CE schemes postponed over the weekend a strike due to begin yesterday following an assurance from the Department of Social Protection that senior officials would embark on a series of talks to address CE supervisors’ grievances. Chief among their demands was that they should be granted pensions on the terms available in the public sector.The Government has said they are employees of private-sector companies and ineligible for a benefit that would cost the exchequer hundreds of millions of euro.The Government forecast last year that granting pensions to 1,250 CE scheme supervisors could cost the State more than €500 million, because it would trigger knock-on claims across the community and voluntary sector."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3891289.1557780915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"department needed to address sectarianism says report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Duncan Morrow, Ulster University Lady Moyra Quigley and Ronnie Kells, Sir George Quigley Committee chair. Prof Morrow is the author of Sectarianism in Northern Ireland: A Review. Photograph: Kelvin BoyesPress EyePA Wire A government department should be set up to address sectarianism in Northern Ireland, according to a new report by Ulster University.The body would have responsibility for the development, co-ordination and oversight of anti-sectarian policies throughout the North.“Sectarianism should be addressed from the centre of government, in a thorough and concerted manner on the basis of clear principles and policies,” the report said.The recommendation is among more than 50 proposals outlined in Sectarianism in Northern Ireland: A Review, which will be launched at a conference in Belfast on Tuesday. It will be addressed by Senator George Mitchell, who chaired the peace talks that led to the signing of the Belfast Agreement, and a number of civic leaders.The report, by Prof Duncan Morrow, was commissioned by the Ulster Bank’s Sir George Quigley Fund, which aims to promote social wellbeing.Among the report’s suggestions are the setting up of a civic body which would be empowered to inform public debate and convey its findings to government.Anti-sectarian principlesIt also recommends that businesses could create a fund for community and social benefit and progress and support the integration of anti-sectarian principles into corporate social responsibility programmes.The report also suggests that the creation of a Youth Assembly should be a “priority” and consideration should be given to lowering the voting age to 16. Every school should plan its curriculum as “shared education”, it said.The Department of Justice and the NI Policing Board should establish a “priority fund” dedicated to repairing or establishing relationships between the police, young people and communities, especially where there is evidence of paramilitary pressure.The leaders of all major churches should unite in an agreed programme to encourage acceptance of and respect for other faiths.The report also highlights the potential for arts, sport and culture to create opportunities for shared experiences and learning and suggests an investment in a shared sports anthem for Northern Ireland.‘Duty of care’Prof Morrow said the “deeply tragic events of recent weeks sharpen the focus on just how dangerously close we remain to this residual threat”.“We have a duty of care and leadership to ensure that the expectation, aspiration and potential of the next and future generations is met and not stifled by sectarian polarisation,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3891028.1557781065!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new light shed on prospect of catholic majority in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Belfast, the changes are ‘striking’: the report describes it as a ‘shared city, where the Catholic population is younger and more confident’. Photograph: Getty Images It says much about Northern Ireland that the continued existence of sectarianism is not in doubt instead the question, posed in report published today by Ulster University, is what should be done about it.“We now have to ask if the capability exists to provide solutions to these problems or whether we must simply hope that with the passage of time they will somehow just go away,” the report states.Sectarianism in Northern Ireland: A Review, by Prof Duncan Morrow, makes more than 50 recommendations – including the establishment of a specific government department to tackle sectarianism – which are based on extensive consultation with a range of sectors and on substantial analysis of statistical and other factors.In so doing, the report sheds fresh light on changing demographics in Northern Ireland and how future trends might affect not only the fluid nature of sectarianism, but also questions of national identity.Underpinning this is “a clear statistical trend towards a change in the religious minority-majority structure” of Northern Ireland and the “measurable trend towards a Catholic majority”.‘Majority rule’In this context, the 2011 census was a “demographic watershed”. For the first time, the proportion of the population declaring themselves as Protestant or brought up Protestant fell below 50 per cent: “In a society characterised by debates over ‘majority rule’, where consent by a majority underpins the legitimacy of the state, the absence of a religious majority is an important symbolic marker,” the report states.There are other changes: only two of the North’s six counties, Antrim and Down, now have “significant Protestant majorities”, and only one – Lisburn – of its five official cities.“Within a decade, Belfast will almost certainly have a Catholic majority,” it states in effect, a majority Protestant Northern Ireland “is now restricted to the suburban area surrounding Belfast.”This trend away from a Protestant majority “is likely to continue”. The main drivers of change are differing birth and death rates between the two communities, the effect of migration, and loss of affiliation, which is more pronounced in urban areas and in the east of Northern Ireland.Both Queen’s and Ulster University have a majority of students from a Catholic background conversely, 63 per cent of students who study in Britain do not return to Northern Ireland, and the report cites other studies which have suggested their numbers are disproportionately Protestant.The report warns about extrapolating too much from these trends. “Translating statistics about religious background into clear consequences for politics and national identity is never straightforward. Irish national identity“It is evident from the data over many years that very few Protestants consider themselves to have an Irish national identity and that the vast majority of those who call themselves Irish also identify as Catholic.”It also highlights a “significant growth” in the number of people calling themselves “Northern Irish” “as a distinct identity” and this is appears to be “shared to a significant degree” across the population.“What is not yet clear is the extent to which ‘Northern Irish’ is a stable or shared category.”In Belfast, the changes are “striking”: the report describes it as a “shared city, where the Catholic population is younger and more confident.”This is particularly true in areas close to interfaces, and the report points out a difference in the profiles of Catholic and Protestant areas around the city’s so-called “peace walls”, even though both are among the most deprived in Northern Ireland. This is particularly true in areas close to interfaces, and the report points out a difference in the profiles of Catholic and Protestant areas around the city’s so-called “peace walls”, even though both are among the most deprived in Northern Ireland. ‘Community decline’“Catholic communities that are younger and poorer may experience restrictions on space andor availability of resources . . . older Protestant communities, which are losing residents, may experience a sense of community decline, dereliction and abandonment.”The report highlights the impact of the so-called “asymmetric dynamic” on politics: unionist politics, it says, often reflect the perception that Protestant areas face a reduction in the physical area of territorial control, the potentially expanding restriction of their area for community celebration regarding parades, flags and emblems, the perception of a growth in influence of feared enemies such as “republicans” and “dissidents” and a sense of cultural pessimism.By contrast, nationalist politicians “appear to be more optimistic about future prospects”. In the absence of fears of further cultural loss, concerns are mainly over housing issues and any continuing evidence of residual discrimination.In the context of demographic changes, the report states, “the narrative of ‘two sides of a wall may soon change into a narrative about growing and declining communities with different demands and real social impact”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3891266.1557779549!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar letter assured facebook s sandberg of business friendly climate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook: The  company announced plans last year to add a further 5,000 jobs to its Irish operation in the coming years, with a move to a new headquarters in Ballsbridge, Dublin. Photograph: Lino MirgelerAFPGetty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar assured Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg of the Government’s “commitment to supporting a business-friendly environment” in a private letter to the internet giant’s executive.Mr Varadkar wrote to Ms Sandberg three months ago, shortly after they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January. He told Facebook’s longtime second-in-command that he was “greatly encouraged to hear about Facebook’s positive experience of Ireland and to get a sense of your future plans”.The Silicon Valley-based company announced plans last year to add a further 5,000 jobs to its Irish operation in the coming years, with a move to a new headquarters at the former Bankcentre campus in Ballsbridge, Dublin.“The Government values Facebook’s investments in Ireland and assures you of our ongoing commitment to supporting a business-friendly environment,” Mr Varadkar wrote in his February 11th letter, released to The  by the Department of the Taoiseach under the Freedom of Information Act.“IDA officials will continue to work closely with your executives here to realise your plans in Ireland,” he added.The correspondence emerges weeks after an in-depth article in Brussels-based Politico Europe questioned whether the Government’s multinational-friendly economic policies made the country the right location for the pan-European regulation of social media giants, who were among the biggest employers in the State.Based in DublinEU internet privacy rules introduced a year ago, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), make Irish regulator the Data Protection Commission the European regulator for Facebook and other major internet companies because their European headquarters are based in Dublin.Previously released correspondence has shown how Mr Varadkar’s predecessor Enda Kenny, who led the government between 2011 and 2017, had a close working relationship with Ms Sandberg.According to an internal Facebook record released in March, Mr Kenny told Facebook executives at a private meeting in January 2013 that he “could exercise significant influence” during Ireland’s presidency of the EU in the first half of that year promoting Facebook’s interests on the reforms of EU data privacy laws.Mr Kenny has not commented on the Facebook memo, which drew criticism that the Government had a cosy relationship with the internet giant.Mr Varadkar’s February 11th letter was replying to an email sent by Ms Sandberg on January 27th.‘Continued investments’“I enjoyed spending time in Dublin earlier in the week and was particularly glad to have the opportunity to share more about our continued investments in Ireland. As promised, I’m attaching a photo to give you an idea of what we’re planning for the new office site,” Ms Sandberg wrote in her email.“I also appreciated your feedback on our ongoing efforts to strike the right balance between free expression and public safety. We are thinking carefully about this and will continue to engage constructively with your government.”The email was copied to Martin Fraser, the secretary to the Government, Martin Shanahan, the chief executive of IDA Ireland and Brian Murphy, one of Mr Varadkar’s advisers.Facebook’s public policy executives, Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister, Joel Kaplan and Niamh Sweeney, head of public policy for Facebook in Ireland, were also copied in on the email.Ms Sandberg had also sent an email to Mr Varadkar after they met in Davos a year earlier.“We all continue to be grateful for the work your government does to make Ireland a great place for our European headquarters,” she wrote in the email dated January 26th, 2018.“We will continue to invest in Dublin and look forward to growing our office over the coming year.”Heavily redactedAn emailed response from Mr Varadkar four days later was heavily redacted by FOI Act censors at the Department of the Taoiseach, but refers to an “interesting” conversation the pair had in Davos.“Let’s stay in touch as matters evolve,” said the Taoiseach of the unidentified subject matter.A follow-up response from Ms Sandberg on February 1st, 2018 was also heavily redacted.On the night of April 4th, 2018, Ms Sweeney sent the Taoiseach a detailed email informing him that almost 45,000 Facebook users in Ireland may have had their personal data compromised in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and outlined the steps the company had taken to prevent it happening again.“This represents 0.0516 per cent of the total number of people affected but any number is too many,” she wrote.She concluded her email telling Mr Varadkar: “We would welcome your feedback on the steps we’ve announced so far and any suggestions you have on what more we should be doing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

After a 15 minute surgery, the vast majority of patients will regain their sight.However barriers to treatment are significant. In many corners of the globe, the £28 operation represents a small fortune – if it is offered at all in local hospitals.  The coordinated approach to community health (Catch) programme, part-funded by the UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), has sought to close treatment gaps by tapping into existing networks established to eradicate trachoma.“Avoidable blindness could triple by 2050 unless efforts to improve eye health-care are stepped up across the world,” Moses Chege, Sightsavers project director for Catch, told The .Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachoma“Catch used innovative ways of improving this eye health-care, by piggybacking on trachoma camps to identify and treat people with other conditions,” he added.The fight against the so-called “disease of thorns” – which turns eyelashes against the globe of the eye and slowly blinds – has been ongoing for decades. Trachoma screening camps established by organisations such as Sightsavers across East Africa, where the disease was endemic, have had considerable success.But thousands of those who went in search of help did not receive treatment, as the trachoma camps were not equipped to tackle the eye conditions they were suffering from.The £5 million Catch programme, funded through the UK government’s aid match scheme, has addressed these gaps in eye care.Between 2014 and 2018, more than 64,600 cases of bacterial conjunctivitis were treated and 28,400 pairs of glasses were provided within the camps.Gladys Atto with patient Loumo Mariam, after performing sight-saving surgeryA further 21,000 people with cataracts who had surgery, having been provided with transport to their nearest hospital facility.“My life has totally changed,” said Loumo Mariam, who had cataract operation last year. “I can now move, look for water, for food. They will say I was half dead, but now I have risen back to life.”In her 60s, Loumo is from a small village in north-west Uganda. After a diagnosis at a trachoma camp in her village she was taken to hospital, completing the hours-long journey with 16 other patients.Her surgery was completed by Gladys Atto, a new ophthalmologist. It costs in the region of £20,000 to train a specialist eye doctor, and Dr Atto is one of 30 funded by Catch.Gladys Atto performing a cataract operation at at Moroto Regional Referral Hospital, North UgandaSome 650 existing health workers also received additional training in eye care - skills desperately required.The 30-year-old can perform as many as 30 cataract operations each day.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleBut as targets to eliminate trachoma are neared and the screening camps no longer required, the Catch project will have to adapt again. Sightsavers say the lessons learned will play a major part in further improving eye care in some of the world’s most remote communities.“It has also strengthened health systems so that this important work can continue,” he added.Sightsavers are currently raising funds for the \u0027End is in Sight\u0027 appeal.

On this job, there were a lot of gay, lesbian and straight people giving their input, and I think people forget that when they point the finger at actors and say that only straight actors should play straight parts.No-one ever points the finger at directors and writers, which I find odd. I think that\u0027s because we\u0027re the face.If people thought about it a little more intelligently, the question wouldn\u0027t come up so much.Jones has said that her character is a fascinating subject, who just happens to be a lesbian. The sex scenes in the show, she says, avoided being gratuitous.Writer Sally Wainwright added: “The thing I probably love most of all about Anne Lister is that she never felt sorry for herself.“In a world that could easily have had no place for her because she was conspicuously a “masculine oddity” (the word lesbian wasn’t used then), she refused to be invisible, she refused to conform and she refused to be down-hearted.”The full interviews can be read in Radio Times magazine, out today.  Brexit latest news: Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins heads to Brussels for \u0026#39talks on political declaration\u0026#39Trump\u0026#39s attorney general assigns prosecutor to investigate \u0026#39origin\u0026#39 of Russia investigationRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFive protesters and army major shot dead in Sudan protests as ousted president Bashir charged over crackdown US and Russia to discuss fate of Venezuela amid reports Putin will not prop up MaduroCalifornia jury orders Monsanto to pay $2 billion damages to a couple who got cancer from Roundup weedkillerComment: Lauren Laverne is not nosy enough to get to the unexpected emotional truths\u0026#39You could never take your eyes off her\u0026#39: the genius of Margot FonteynJeremy Kyle taken off air indefinitely after guest found dead a week \u0026#39after taking lie-detector test\u0026#39 on showComment: We need an urgent global response to the plague of plasticThere are more offenders in organised crime groups than soldiers in the army, says top police chief Comment: Cometh the hour, cometh the man – it\u0026#39s time for the Tories to send for Boris Save our species: The sad tale of Britain\u0026#39s disappearing dormousePrimary school exam stress is exacerbated by teachers who are \u0026#39manufacturing anxiety\u0026#39, says OfstedDeepest-ever sub e in Mariana Trench reveals rubbish littering ocean floorCountess Spencer: how I glammed up the English country house weekendAlaska air crash: At least four killed in mid-air seaplane collisionPlastics killing up to a million people a year, warns Sir David Attenborough  \u0026#39Deaths of despair\u0026#39 rising among middle-aged Britons, report warnsNHS threatening millions with fines for validly claiming free prescriptions, investigation findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deepest ever sub dive reveals rubbish littering ocean floor","story":"On the deepest e ever made by a human inside a submarine, a Texas investor and explorer found something he could have found in the gutter of nearly any street in the world: rubbish.Victor Vescovo, a retired naval officer, said he made the unsettling discovery as he descended nearly 6.8 miles (35,853 feet10,928 meters) to a point in the Pacific Ocean\u0027s Mariana Trench that is the deepest place on Earth. His e went 52 feet (16 meters) lower than the previous deepest descent in the trench in 1960.Mr Vescovo found undiscovered species as he visited places no human had gone before. On one occasion he spent four hours on the floor of the trench, viewing sea life ranging from shrimp-like anthropods with long legs and antennae to translucent sea pigs similar to a sea cucumber.He also saw angular metal or plastic objects, one with writing on it.It was very disappointing to see obvious human contamination of the deepest point in the ocean, Mr Vescovo told Reuters.An object described as \u0026#34manmade\u0026#34 is illuminated at top right by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchPlastic waste has reached epidemic proportions in the world\u0027s oceans with an estimated 100 million tonnes dumped there to date, according to the United Nations. Scientists have found large amounts of micro plastic in the guts of deep-dwelling ocean mammals like whales.A report published on Tuesday, one of the first to document the impact of discarded plastic on the health of the poorest people in the world, estimates that between 400,000 and one million people die every year because of diseases and accidents linked to poorly managed waste in developing countries.Mr Vescovo hoped his discovery of rubbish in the Mariana Trench would raise awareness about dumping in the oceans and pressure governments to better enforce existing regulations, or put new ones in place.It\u0027s not a big garbage collection pool, even though it\u0027s treated as such, Mr Vescovo said of the worlds\u0027 oceans.Undersea explorer Victor Vescovo pilots the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchHis discovery comes a year after a study revealed how human activities were affecting deep-sea ecosystems.Scientists from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokosuka found a plastic bag while exploring the deep trench. Other waste found by the probe include metal, rubber, fishing gear, glass and various other man-made items.In the last three weeks, the expedition has made four es in the Mariana Trench in his submarine, DSV Limiting Factor, collecting biological and rock samples.Sea creatures swim around a part of a submersible lander, illuminated by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor on the floor of the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchIt was the third time humans have ed to the deepest point in the ocean, known as Challenger Deep. Canadian movie maker James Cameron was the last to visit in 2012 in his submarine, reaching a depth of 35,787 feet (10,908 meters).Prior to Cameron\u0027s e, the first-ever expedition to Challenger Deep was made by the U.S. Navy in 1960, reaching a depth of 10,912 metersPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins heads to Brussels for \u0026#39talks on political declaration\u0026#39Trump\u0026#39s attorney general assigns prosecutor to investigate \u0026#39origin\u0026#39 of Russia investigationRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFive protesters and army major shot dead in Sudan protests as ousted president Bashir charged over crackdown US and Russia to discuss fate of Venezuela amid reports Putin will not prop up MaduroCalifornia jury orders Monsanto to pay $2 billion damages to a couple who got cancer from Roundup weedkillerComment: Lauren Laverne is not nosy enough to get to the unexpected emotional truths\u0026#39You could never take your eyes off her\u0026#39: the genius of Margot FonteynJeremy Kyle taken off air indefinitely after guest found dead a week \u0026#39after taking lie-detector test\u0026#39 on showComment: We need an urgent global response to the plague of plasticThere are more offenders in organised crime groups than soldiers in the army, says top police chief Comment: Cometh the hour, cometh the man – it\u0026#39s time for the Tories to send for Boris Countess Spencer: how I glammed up the English country house weekendSave our species: The sad tale of Britain\u0026#39s disappearing dormousePrimary school exam stress is exacerbated by teachers who are \u0026#39manufacturing anxiety\u0026#39, says OfstedAlaska air crash: At least four killed in mid-air seaplane collisionPlastics killing up to a million people a year, warns Sir David Attenborough  \u0026#39Deaths of despair\u0026#39 rising among middle-aged Britons, report warnsSuranne Jones: Straight actors unfairly criticised for taking LGBT rolesNHS threatening millions with fines for validly claiming free prescriptions, investigation findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 14 may 2019","story":"A member of the Filipino indigenous tribe \u0027Igorot\u0027 clad in traditional costume casts his election ballot at a school used as a polling station in Baguio City, Mountain Province, northern Philippines.

the practice of excluding disruptive pupils to improve results.Ms Spielman said on Monday: Good primary schools manage to run key stage tests often with children not even knowing that they\u0027re being tested.I was in a primary school not very long ago, I saw something that did actually concern me where the head was going around patting the Year 6s on the shoulder saying, ‘are you feeling okay about the tests, is everything going well for you?’ I thought that’s actually subliminally encouraging children to feel anxious.“Everybody should think about their behaviour because the mere act of talking about something might just help to ratchet things up.”In the same week that SATs and GCSEs begin, the new Ofsted publication is aimed at helping the inspectors spot “exam factories” and schools that narrow the curriculum to pander to test results.Ofsted\u0026#39s chief inspector Amanda Spielman said she is concerned that teachers are “encouraging children to feel anxious” “When you talk to some of the Oxbridge admissions tutors, for example, they say they know the difference between which schools are exam factories, which are very good at manufacturing grades but young people are arriving at university with very little of the intellectual development,” added Ms Spielman.She said: “We absolutely want to make sure that the inspection conversation helps us to discriminate between schools that are getting exams results the right way and one thats are taking shortcuts.”Revealed today is also crack down on schools who favour “off-rolling” low achieving pupils as a means of boosting themselves in the league tables.Mathew Purves, Ofsted’s Deputy Director of Schools said: “Data might tell us there has been unusual movements of pupils, but that doesn\u0027t tell us if off-rolling has taken place or not.“It’s a detailed set of forensic inspection conversations and it’s about getting to the heart of these decisions that have been made for these pupils. Were they made in their interest, or were they made in the school interest, or in the interest some kind of performance table?”As suggested back in January, school inspectors will also mark institutions on how much they help children “develop their character” which includes their resilience, confidence and independence.Ofsted has added a stand-alone category for “personal development” for the first time, as a way to encourage schools to prioritise extra-curricular activities.The new framework separates personal development from “behaviour and attitudes” which is also an inidual category for the first time.  Revealed today is also crack down on schools who favour “off-rolling” low achieving pupils as a means of boosting themselves in the league tables.It comes as the inspectors have recognised that bullying “is going to occur” in schools. The revised guidelines aim to make sure schools employ a culture of dealing with bullying rather than “sweeping it under the carpet”.The move follows research by Ofsted which revealed a rise in “low level” disruption such as children playing on their mobile phones and other electronic devices in the classroom.  It follows a consultation over nearly two years of teachers, headteachers, unions, academics and parents. The framework will be followed from September this year, following 250 pilot inspections.Following parent feedback on the January draft, Ofsted have chosen to add an element of inspection for schools that offer provision for learners with special education needs.They have also chosen to initiate all preparation off-site, discarding their original idea that allowed inspectors onto school sites at short notice, the day before inspections.Ms Spielman added: “Our goal is really simple: to be a force for improvement through our inspections. We want to provide parents with the assurance they need, support teachers and leaders to excel - and help make sure all children and learners to get the education they deserve.”Damian Hinds, the Education Secretary, said: Ofsted\u0027s role in the education system is of vital importance - and the introduction of this new framework is a major step in supporting our shared drive to raise standards across the school system so that every child can have access to a world class education.Brexit latest news: Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins heads to Brussels for \u0026#39talks on political declaration\u0026#39Trump\u0026#39s attorney general assigns prosecutor to investigate \u0026#39origin\u0026#39 of Russia investigationRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFive protesters and army major shot dead in Sudan protests as ousted president Bashir charged over crackdown US and Russia to discuss fate of Venezuela amid reports Putin will not prop up MaduroCalifornia jury orders Monsanto to pay $2 billion damages to a couple who got cancer from Roundup weedkillerComment: Lauren Laverne is not nosy enough to get to the unexpected emotional truths\u0026#39You could never take your eyes off her\u0026#39: the genius of Margot FonteynJeremy Kyle taken off air indefinitely after guest found dead a week \u0026#39after taking lie-detector test\u0026#39 on showComment: We need an urgent global response to the plague of plasticThere are more offenders in organised crime groups than soldiers in the army, says top police chief Comment: Cometh the hour, cometh the man – it\u0026#39s time for the Tories to send for Boris Countess Spencer: how I glammed up the English country house weekendSave our species: The sad tale of Britain\u0026#39s disappearing dormouseDeepest-ever sub e in Mariana Trench reveals rubbish littering ocean floorAlaska air crash: At least four killed in mid-air seaplane collisionPlastics killing up to a million people a year, warns Sir David Attenborough  \u0026#39Deaths of despair\u0026#39 rising among middle-aged Britons, report warnsSuranne Jones: Straight actors unfairly criticised for taking LGBT rolesNHS threatening millions with fines for validly claiming free prescriptions, investigation findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/13/TELEMMGLPICT000194570075_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNHPnaojp5PseXVWAlSJjp7Iy3YyRNvpV_-8fWzPLLSM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"save species sad tale britains disappearing dormouse","story":"A sleeping dormouse recorded by the Surrey Dormouse Group Perhaps unsurprisingly for a creature that spends three quarters of its life asleep, when I finally encounter a dormouse in the wild it is in a state of blissful repose.

If you don’t have an Apple TV box, you can still access the app on the latest Samsung TVs.\u0026nbspIn March, Apple revealed a new TV+ video subscription service at a star-studded event in Cupertino. The company said the service would be part of an updated Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad and Apple TV streaming box.\u0026nbspThat app has just gone live in over 100 countries, though the new programming from Apple won’t be a part of it until it launches in the autumn. But the app has been subtly –\u0026nbspthough comprehensively –\u0026nbspchanged.The TV app is what Apple wants to be your first port of call for TV programming, and it already has neat features. One of the most useful is the Watch Now tab which keeps track of what you’ve been watching and finds the next stuff for you to see. When you’re halfway through an episode, it’ll keep track of where you are so you can pick up from that point, whether that’s on your Apple TV or iPad, for instance.The updated app, which I’ve been trying and which looks very inviting, by the way, has had a new lick of digital paint, with more sections to choose from. The main design of a screen-filling image with tiles of the latest programmes or movies\u0026nbspremains, though those tiles are now widescreen instead of square for TV shows, and vertical posters for movies.More importantly, there’s now a range of recommendations which are personalised for the user based on what you’ve watched already, in a section now called For You.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

As they are added, many offer a free time-limited trial so you can be sure it’s a channel you want to watch.One useful feature is being able to download shows for offline watching, though it’s worth noting that Sky Q and Netflix already offer something similar.Speaking of Netflix, it’s not available within the TV app, though you can access the programming through the separate Netflix app. Amazon Prime Video, another rival, is part of the TV app and it’s true to say that the greater integration does help make the app a desirable destination. Especially since the Apple TV box’s universal search system scans programming from multiple sources. The multiple channels in the same app is one of the coolest features of the app, and is simple, intuitive and useful.iPhone owners can sue Apple over its apps, US Supreme Court decidesSaudi sisters call for \u0027inhuman\u0027 woman-monitoring app to be removedThere’s a new Kids section which aggregates suitable content into appealing sections so you can find programmes with your favourite characters, for example, more easily, though there are also isions by age appropriateness as well. Apple has staff who curate programmes, handpicking the best ones.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most striking change is that the Apple TV app is available on Samsung TVs now as well. It’s initially available on all 2019 Samsung smart TVs and some models from last year. If your Samsung TV has AirPlay 2 compatibility –\u0026nbspthat’s the video streaming system Apple uses –\u0026nbspyou can also play content directly from your iPad, say, to the TV. This was previously only possible via an Apple TV box before.Other TV brands including LG and Sony will follow later in the year.Channels you subscribe to are accessible to everyone in your family at no extra cost, so you can watch one thing on your telly while another family member consumes content simultaneously on their iPhone or iPad, for instance. This applies for up to six family members and subscriptions are shared via Apple ID and password.The TV app was already a seamless way to watch most of your programming, whether through purchased movies or catch-up services. Now, it’s more snazzily designed and the convenience of doing everything from within the app is better still.Adding TVs from other companies, and later streaming boxes from Amazon, for example, may affect sales of the Apple TV streaming box, but the added familiarity of an app that is largely the same on multiple platforms is a neat way to make the TV app a convenient destination.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBreaking through the $6,000 barrier was a moment of truth for bitcoin... it holds a major psychological significance for the community, said Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency expert\u0026nbspat the online trading platform eToro.We could see prices reach levels last seen at the start of 2019, potentially hitting the $12,000 to $14,000 range by the end of the year.Other major cryptocurrencies have been significantly boosted by bitcoin\u0027s turnaround in fortunes, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin.\u0026nbspThe combined market capitalisations of the top four alternative cryptocurrencies have risen by nearly $10 billion since the start of May.The cryptocurrency market\u0027s remarkable recovery comes despite traditional markets seeing a relative slowdown in growth since the start of the year.Given that global markets are having a bit of a wobble at the minute, bitcoin\u0027s price growth in recent weeks means it is one ot the strongest asset classes so far in 2019, Mr Peters said.Other experts have suggested similar positive movement in the months ahead, with financial adviser Nigel Green saying in April that the so-called crypto winter has come to an end.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Andy Martin meets one of the brains behind the projectClick to followThe IndependentStark raised thousands of pounds for his firm through public initiatives and private donationsAs a schoolboy, Adam Stark was torn between being a musician and a computer scientist. So while he was supposed to be studying IT at Queen Mary University\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspLondon, he was mainly moonlighting on bass guitar and keyboards in a band called Munro Fox. But he also did a bit of producing and engineering on the side. By the time he graduated and embarked on a PhD, there had been a convergence between his academic work and his “first love”. The subject of his dissertation was Musicians and Machines: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Live Performance.“It made perfect sense,” he says when we meet in the cafe at the British Library in London. “I had been studying the mathematical relation of the harmonic series. The problem was how to make machines more sensitive.” Stark is 36 now, managing director of MI.MU\u0026nbsp(pronounced Me-Mew), and has come up with the most musically sensitive glove in the history of the world.Music is now, inescapably, music tech. Computers are an integral part of music production. “But,” says Stark, “they are still stupid: they don’t understand changes in tempo.” His dream is to get a computer tapping its foot in time to the music. “Why can’t I play a G chord and the computer chimes in with me?” The idea of “machine musicianship” is not to turn musicians into clunky robots but to free them up and allow them to play with more soul and spontaneity.The MI.MU\u0026nbspglove may be the closest we have yet come to synchronising musician and machine. “I love going to gigs,” says Stark. “But when you see live performances of electronic music, it often looks as if they’re sending their emails.” A guy behind a box pressing buttons or twiddling knobs is never going to be as visceral or exciting as a drummer or a guitarist. The glove enables you to become a one-hand band. “It gives the electronic performer the same expressive power that acoustic musicians have.”We’ve always used our hands to communicate. With the advent of the glove, body language is now body music. But (a word of warning) you have to be a decent musician to start with. It’s not going to magically turn a clumsy wannabe into a virtuoso overnight.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

She wanted to do a live performance in her garden using a glove. “She needed something serious and professional, not a toy.” The seed had been planted by an opera singer who had used a glove, engineered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u0026nbspMedia\u0026nbspLab, to produce more vibrato. Gloves had also been used to control machinery. “But we had to start again from scratch,” says Stark. “They weren’t up to spec.”Stark pays tribute to all the people involved in the project. As well as musicians and techies (including Tom Mitchell of the University of the West of England in Bristol), they needed a textile specialist (Hannah Wilson) to make the gloves work and a designer (Rachel Freire) to bring style and flair and make them look and feel good. The summer of 2012 saw Imogen Heap performing a song, with the gloves, in a geodesic dome powered by the pedalling of massed cyclists in her back garden in Essex.Imogen Heap presents the glove to a summit in Lisbon last year (Getty)But that was just the start. They had made something wonderful: an item of clothing that controlled music wearable tech, but fitted, bespoke, to just one inidual artist. It was hugely over-designed and expensive. The point was to make one that worked potentially for anyone. That’s when MI.MU\u0026nbspwas born with a mission to “enable people to express themselves through tech”. The name means Me-Music, ie you are personalising the music you play, shaping it – with the movements of your own body – to give form to your mood and thoughts and personality.At the beginning, you needed a backpack, loaded with technical kit, wired to the gloves, and a team of people standing in the wings to make it work. Now, after years of research and development, the glove really is just a very streamlined, sinuous-looking glove, connected to a computer via bluetooth. Numerous artists, including Ariana Grande on her 2015 world tour, have road-tested them. And now they’re available to pre-order online direct from MI.MU\u0026nbspat £2,500 per pair (you can buy one at half the price).Harry Potter composer invents pair of gloves that makes musicBut what impressed me was Stark’s ability to drum up funding to keep the whole show on the road for years before the product could go on sale. Inidual musicians who believed in the concept chipped in thousands of pounds. But Stark was also able to win a number of grants, from Innovate UK (funded by the government) and an EU source, Horizon 2020. The company still had to finesse the sensors that were capable of recognising postures and measuring the bend of a finger or the orientation of a wrist. Are you clenching your fist? Pinching your fingers? The glove needs to know.Wearing these gloves is cool in a\u0026nbspway that holding a white stick\u0026nbspis notThe gloves are made of 60 per cent\u0026nbsprecycled fabric. MI.MU\u0026nbspuses\u0026nbspCarvico vita, a high performance sports fabric, and Yulex, a sustainable, plant-based alternative to neoprene. And they are produced in Leicester by Sew Systems, who helped them develop fabric bonding in place of stitching.The glove can be used by dancers and actors as well as musicians:\u0026nbsp“They’ve got the movement, now we can do the sound.” But Stark reckons that\u0026nbsp“gesture-based” tech\u0026nbsphas other potential uses. He foresees MI.MU-gloved surgeons carrying out remote operations in far-flung parts of the world via Skype. Meanwhile, he is still heading up a long-running musical project called Rumour Cubes\u0026nbspand there is talk of his old band, Munro Fox, reforming. At least they won’t need a huge vehicle to lug all their kit around. All they have to do is snap their fingers.View from the TopQueen Mary University of LondonOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not ready to return home to Washington DC\u0026nbspyet, the couple scoured Airbnb\u0026nbspfor holiday\u0026nbsprentals and found a cabin in the mountains of West Virginia in a town called Lost River. Neither of them had heard of the place before, but they instantly fell in love with its wild, forested landscape – and the solitude.“It didn’t feel like any place I’d been to before,” says\u0026nbspJonas, who grew up backpacking with her family near their home in northern California. “All the other places where I’d vacationed around here were full of people.” When her wife, Laurie, suggested buying property there, Jonas, an entrepreneur, wondered if there might be a business opportunity.Now, two years later, Jonas and two friends, Shawn Harrington and Andrew St\u0026nbspCyr, have launched Lost River Vacations, an eco-friendly tiny house retreat on a 22-acre property in Lost River. Two and a half hours away from the district, the retreat is scheduled to open in June.The three friends are all small businesses owners in the DC\u0026nbsparea, but what makes their story unique is not that they’re starting a trendy new venture – it’s that their trendy new venture is owned, managed, and supported almost exclusively by the deaf community. Jonas, Harrington, and St\u0026nbspCyr, who met as students at Gallaudet University, are deaf the tiny house itself was built by deaf carpenters a deaf-owned company, Catalyst+, will design hiking trails on the property and the walls of the tiny house will be decorated with artwork by deaf artists.That’s part of the purpose of Lost River Vacations – to support the deaf economy.“Deaf people and deaf businesses have been marginalised for a long time,” Harrington says\u0026nbspRed Bear Brewing Co, where Lost River Vacations launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to expand the retreat. “If you take a deaf business and a hearing business, people typically choose the hearing business,” Harrington says. By encouraging everyone to visit their retreat, the trio hopes that hearing people, who might otherwise be reluctant to hire deaf businesses and iniduals, will see the value deaf people can add to a project and be inspired to work with them.They\u0026nbspwill open with one tiny house that sleeps four available to rent. But the trio hopes to raise enough capital to build 10\u0026nbspmore small abodes, including a tree house and a yurt, in the years ahead. This past week, they raised enough money to build a second house that they hope will be up and running later this summer.The retreat, previously a hunting ground, is 2\u0026nbspmiles away from Lost River State Park. It lies outside the range of mobile-phone\u0026nbspservice and sits at an elevation of 1,850ft\u0026nbspwith views of mountains and forests – and no signs of other human inhabitants. (Urban travellers need not fear: “High-speed wifi,” the retreat’s website reads, “makes it easy to post your best pictures to Instagram!”)Google Doodle honours Charles-Michel de l’Épée, ‘father of deaf’More than 500 deaf people gathered for the fundraiser at Red Bear Brewing Co\u0026nbspover craft beers, sausages and free cake to support Lost River Vacations. All across the room, people in the crowd – which included government workers, small business owners, and students – were signing to one another while the deaf DJ, Nico DiMarco, blared songs like “No Scrubs” and “All the Single Ladies” loudly enough so that the audience could “feel” the beats and vibrations of the music. (DiMarco’s brother, Nyle, also deaf, was the 2015 winner of the reality show America’s Top Model.)It was no accident that the event was full of creative talent, says\u0026nbspCalvin Young, a filmmaker who created the marketing video for Lost River Vacations, as he interacted with the crowd at the brewery.“We have something called ‘deaf gain’,” says\u0026nbspYoung, explaining that when one sense like hearing is missing, that amplifies the others, like taste and sight\u0026nbsp– meaning that in the deaf community, there are a disproportionate number of cooks, artists\u0026nbspand designers. “Hearing people might focus on sound,” Young says, “but when I’m filming, I’ll focus on movement or the facial expression. There is no sound in my videos. I want people to see my film as I see them, through deaf eyes.”Rosemary Latin, the baker of the free cake, was sitting along a wall watching the party unfold. A pastry chef, she founded Rosemary’s Fabulous Cakes in Keedysville, Maryland in 2003. Many of her clients are deaf, but she also has a roster of hearing clients, some of whom didn’t realise she was deaf when they first approached her. “When they found out,” Latin says, “they were a little resistant at first.” They worried about how they’d communicate and work together. But Latin reassured them. She told them that they could communicate via texting rather than calling. “I had to be a bit more assertive,” she says.Entrepreneurs like Latin, Young\u0026nbspand Jonas and her partners are bucking trends in the deaf community. According to an analysis by the National Deaf Centre, which used data from the US\u0026nbspCensus’s 2014 American Community Survey, the employment rate among the deaf is 48 per cent compared to 72 per cent in the hearing community, and nearly half of all deaf people are not in the labour force compared to a quarter of hearing people.“The deaf community is starving for entrepreneurs,” says\u0026nbspRyan Maliszewski at Red Bear.Cyr, Jane Jonas\u0026nbspand Shawn Harrington\u0026nbspduring the\u0026nbspfundraiser at Red Bear Brewing Co\u0026nbspin Washington\u0026nbspDCMaliszewski directs the Gallaudet Innovation and\u0026nbspEntrepreneurship Institute, which launched in the autumn\u0026nbspof 2017. Most students at Gallaudet, he says, major in communication studies, interpretation\u0026nbspor social work, and go on to work in deaf-related roles, such as teachers in deaf schools. Though that’s fine, he also wants the students to not be afraid to think big. Being deaf, Maliszewski points out, equips students with a set of characteristics that makes them natural entrepreneurs – like assertiveness and the ability to quickly adapt and be resourceful.“Our community has some absolutely phenomenal talents, but they do not communicate using sound, so they are unknown,” Jonas says, “so it’s my passion to get their work and talents out there.”The other, major goal of Lost River Vacations is to expose more hearing people to the deaf community.of deaf people are unemployed, according to analysis by the National Deaf CentreThe retreat will welcome deaf and hearing people alike, and the three co-founders hope that hearing people who come will leave with a different perspective on deaf iniduals. Right now, Harrington explains, many hearing people see deafness as a disability, a term that implies victimhood and helplessness. They don’t understand how deaf people can function in a culture as auditory as ours. “Once when I was at a restaurant,” Harrington says, “a stranger gave me a $20 bill saying ‘I’m so sorry you’re deaf.’ But it’s like, no, I can pay for my own food! But they learn you’re deaf and they think everything is falling apart, that there’s something wrong with you.”It’s similar with parents, he explains. More than\u0026nbsp90 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, and many of these parents believe the only way for their children to succeed is by learning to speak. There is a major schism in the deaf community between people who embrace sign language\u0026nbspas their primary method of communication and those who want themselves or their children to assimilate into hearing culture with cochlear implants and speech therapy.NHS to offer hundreds more deaf people life-changing implantBritish Sign Language GCSE may be introduced after deaf boy’s campaign‘Deaf students far less likely to attend prestigious UK universities’Growing up, Jonas sat in the middle of that schism. She was raised by hearing parents in Berkeley, California. Her mother, a high-school foreign language teacher, understood the critical importance of language to the development of a young child and so learned to sign with Jonas. But Jonas’s parents also sent her to thousands of hours of speech therapy classes. Eventually, they enrolled her in deaf schools. Jonas thrived academically and when the time came to choose a college, she decided to attend Gallaudet. She considered going to a more mainstream school like UC Santa Cruz, where she’d been accepted, but Jonas realised she didn’t want to spend the next four years of her life speaking and learning through an interpreter. She wanted to “figure out how to be a deaf person in the world,” she says.Jonas, Harrington, and St\u0026nbspCyr want to show deaf children, their parents\u0026nbspand the hearing community that it’s possible to be productive and successful while embracing one’s deaf identity.Seeing Lost River Vacations launch, Maliszewski says, gave him goosebumps. “I want students to hear more of these stories,” he says, “and say, ‘Oh, if they can do it, I can do it, too.’”Audiology and DeafnessOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prominent among them will be its continued interests in rail franchises, which Coastal doesn’t think are worth having. But that’ll likely be just the starter for ten. \u0026nbspFirst certainly has some questions to answer.It’s shares were in a trough before Coast started agitating, and it’s been losing money if you look at the raw numbers rather than the adjusted ones the company would prefer people concentrated on. It lost a CEO last year and the rail business is beset with uncertainties, with the government wanting operators to take responsibility for a wonky pension and a review into the future of the industry\u0026nbspunder way.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGiven that it was commissioned by a Department for Transport run by Calamity Chris Grayling, it’s understandable why investors might be worried about First’s continued involvement in the sector, notwithstanding its arguments about the handsome returns that it has made from it.\u0026nbspThing is, there is a route for Coastal to achieve what it wants\u0026nbspwithout the need for EGMs, boardroom coups, or websites listing grievances. It could table a takeover bid after which it would be free to appoint whomever it wanted to run the thing and implement its strategy.Of course, that would involve the outfit buying out all the other shareholders at a premium and\u0026nbspCoast\u0026nbspdoesn’t want to do that, hence all the noise\u0026nbsp(this sort of thing is great fun for those of us in the media).\u0026nbspDirectors are, of course, charged with acting in the interests of all shareholders. But don’t kid yourself.

This morning the bank sought to stop the rot\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent Bank has sought to reassure investors and customers that all is well with the institution“Meet the new bankers, same as the old bankers.”That was The Independent’s headline at the top of a piece I wrote back in 2016, having delved into the backgrounds of the bosses of the challenger banks the government hoped would shake up Britain’s moribund banking industry. More than half of them were linked through having worked for Fred Goodwin’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which ended up nearly breaking the UK economy.\u0026nbspGiven the rash of negative stories about  Bank (its boss Craig Donaldson is one of the RBS alumni who were featured in that story), would that headline today read\u0026nbsp“meet the new banks, same as the old banks”?\u0026nbsp Bank reassures customers’ their money safe after WhatsApp rumour Bank should not let recent failures alter its course Bank and Starling get millions from RBS competition fundThere was even, over the weekend, an incidence of people queuing to withdraw cash in west London, which brought back uncomfortable memories of a certain Northern Rock.\u0026nbspFor goodness sake, calm down, said the bank this morning, in response to some of the wild rumours flying around social media. We’re not even close to being in the sort of situation the Rock was in. Yes, we’re raising £350m from our investors, but it’s to finance growth, not to bail us out and it’s going well. We’ll complete before the end of June. So move along, there really is nothing to see here.\u0026nbspThe trouble for  is that it created a rod for its own back when it had to admit that it had messed up with the risk classification of some of its loans for regulatory purposes – a big no no – and reported some disappointing results at the start of the year.\u0026nbspThe shares behaved as if they’d taken a right to the nose from Canelo\u0026nbspAlvarez. They’ve been rolling around on the floor ever since. Shorting the stock has been a favoured tactic of hedge fund managers with their eyes on new yachts. In the space of not much more than a year, a stock that had reached the giddy heights of £35 has fallen back to just over £5. It was on the slide again this morning.\u0026nbspThe world outside London’s financial centre has taken note of this. It has only added fuel to the brush fires that Donaldson and his team are now trying to put out.\u0026nbspThey’ve pointed to the awards  has been winning for customer service, the fact that it’s opening branches when others are closing them, the profits it has declared.Your money is safe, and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme covers you up to £85,000 anyway, has been the message.\u0026nbspProblem is, bitter past experience tells people there’s no smoke without fire and logic says that if they’re worried it’s safer to get out. Even though depositor protection has markedly improved since the Rock hit the rocks, getting compensation takes time and causes inconvenience and worry.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

No jobs cuts are expected prior to that date.Director of Honda UK Jason Smith\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It is with a heavy heart that today we confirm the closure of Honda’s factory in Swindon. We understand the impact this decision has on our associates, suppliers and the wider community. We are committed to continuing to support them throughout the next phases of the consultation process.”The Japanese carmaker had announced plans in February to leave the site in South Marston near Swindon. It said the change was not as a result of Brexit but because it is shifting focus to electric cars with most demand expected to be in Asia.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersAfter consulting\u0026nbspwith the government and external consultants engaged by the Unite union, closure was deemed to be inevitable.Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Clearly, this is a disappointing decision, despite the best efforts of local MPs, civic and business leaders and the trade unions since Honda’s initial announcement in February. We recognise this is a worrying time for affected employees, their families and businesses in the supply chain.”Business secretary Greg Clark has set up a local taskforce which\u0026nbspaims to ensure that\u0026nbspemployees are able to move on to new skilled employment. That taskforce is due to hold its next meeting next week.Honda is one of a number of car manufacturers to cut back its presence in the UK this year. Nissan said in January that it would build its new X-Trail model in Japan instead of Sunderland, despite earlier reassurances.Ford is planning to offer redundancy to more than 500 staff at its Essex office, while Jaguar Land Rover confirmed in January that it would cut 4,500 jobs from its 40,000-strong UK workforce as it attempts to deal with a sharp drop in demand in China.I can’t blame Honda for leaving, this country keeps letting them downUnite national officer for automotive industries\u0026nbspDes Quinn said he believed there was a case for keeping the plant open and that the government would have provided public funding.“It would have made Honda a global leader in emerging battery technology and in a strong position to exploit the growing global market for electric vehicles in the coming years,” Mr Quinn said.“Instead we have this body blow which is nothing short of a betrayal of the workforce, customers and the wider supply chain which relies on Honda Swindon for work.“Unite can only conclude that Honda is taking a strategic decision to retreat out of Europe in favour of protecting its North American operations and avoiding president Trump’s tariff threat on cars made in Europe.”Honda said it was closing\u0026nbspthe Swindon factory as part of a broader global strategy “in response to changes to the automotive industry”.The company also faces the reality of uncertain tariffs on vehicle exports from the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, Japan and the EU recently finalised a trade deal that will see tariffs on Japanese vehicles imported into the trading bloc reduced from 10 per cent\u0026nbspto zero.In a statement on Monday, Honda said: “As previously communicated in February, Honda is accelerating its electrification plans, and as a result resources, capabilities and production systems for electrified vehicles will be focused in regions with a high volume of customer demand.“This concludes the first phase of the collective consultation process. The second phase – which includes agreeing associate redundancy packages and identifying the impact on inidual roles up until production ceases in 2021 – will begin immediately.“Honda will also intensify its engagement with the Swindon taskforce set up by secretary of state Greg Clark, in order to work with government and a broad range of stakeholders to mitigate the impact of this decision on the wider community.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It prompts often-unnecessary fear and distress from some of the millions who receive it.\u0026nbspAnd worse, as it’s a gateway document, this reverberates across society, and therefore risks wrongly deterring many from a future of higher education.”The report, which calls for the current student loan statement to be redesigned, will be presented to the government and to Philip Augar, who is leading the review of post-18 education and funding.National deficit rises by £12bn in change to student loan accountingAmatey Doku, vice president higher education at\u0026nbspNational Union of Students (NUS), welcomed “a clearer, more detailed student loan statement” and calls for it to be more difficult to change loan repayment terms.But he warned: This report must not be used to suggest that students and graduates endorse the current funding system even if they would welcome clearer information, and improved loan statement should not be a Trojan horse to rebrand loans as a ‘graduate contribution scheme’ if their underlying mechanics remain the same.It would be more misleading to students and the public to downplay student loan arrangements which result in the poorest graduating with higher debts than the richest, and where the repayment system is flawed and regressive.\u0026nbspWe must start with a fundamental redesign of student finance, not its resulting paperwork.”A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said they welcomed the contribution to the government’s review of post-18 education and funding – which includes “looking at how information about student finance can be communicated as clearly as possible to borrowers.”They added: “Student loan statements are currently issued annually, setting out the balance, repayments and interest for borrowers but we are continually working to improve the repayment system.\u0026nbspWe are exploring how students taking out a student loan can have better access to much more up-to-date information on their repayments.”A Student Loans Company (SLC) spokesperson said they were working towards making more repayment information available to customers online.They added: “We are already engaged with customers to explore how best to present repayment information and always welcome discussion on how to make our communications transparent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That left it riven with cliffs called thrust faults, marked all over its surface.Now a new analysis, using data from Nasa missions, suggests that the Moon could still be shrinking today. As it does, it is experiencing moonquakes along those thrust faults, with the planet shaking along those cliffs.Scientists compare the process to the way a grape will gradually wrinkle up, adding lines as it cools and shrinks. But unlike a grape\u0027s skin, the crust around the Moon cannot stretch and is instead brittle, making it break apart as the shrinking happens.The faults form when the crust moves around, and one part of the crust is pushed up over another. They form unusual-looking cliffs that can be seen from the surface, standing tall and many miles long.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

It helped shed new light on those moonquakes, including allowing for a better understanding of where they are actually coming from.Rock smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse and left huge craterOnce that location data was generated, it could be laid on top of the images of the thrust faults that were taken from a 2010 study that used pictures from Nasa\u0027s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.Comparing the two, they found that at least eight of the rumbles were coming from movement of plates beneath the Moon\u0027s surface, not from asteroid impacts or other explanations. That helped confirm that the Moon is still experiencing true tectonic activity, according to the new paper published in Nature Geoscience.The instruments left by Apollo astronauts in the past finished their work in 1977. But scientists think this shaking and shrinking is still happening to this day, with images seeming to show evidence of recent movement, such as boulders and landslides that appear to have recently fallen over.Nasa\u0027s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LROC NAC frame M190844037LR NASAGSFCArizona State UniversitySmithsonian)We found that a number of the quakes recorded in the Apollo data happened very close to the faults seen in the LRO imagery, said\u0026nbspNicholas Schmerr, an assistant professor of geology at the University of Maryland, in a statement.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s quite likely that the faults are still active today. You don\u0027t often get to see active tectonics anywhere but Earth, so it\u0027s very exciting to think these faults may still be producing moonquakes.The seismic data was taken from instruments that astronauts dropped onto the surface during Apollo missions. The one left by Apollo 11 died after a few weeks – but the rest kept measuring, eventually picking up 28 different, shallow moonquakes between\u0026nbsp1969 and 1977.Of those quakes, eight were picked up near to the faults that could be seen in images of the Moon\u0027s surface. That led them to conclude the two were connected.What\u0027s more, most of the shakes happened when the Moon was at the point of its orbit furthest away from the Earth. That happens because the stress from Earth\u0027s gravity disrupts its crust.We think it\u0027s very likely that these eight quakes were produced by faults slipping as stress built up when the lunar crust was compressed by global contraction and tidal forces, indicating that the Apollo seismometers recorded the shrinking moon and the moon is still tectonically active, said Thomas Watters, lead author of the research paper and senior scientist in the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.Jeff Bezos wants to help Trump return the US to the moonWater just below surface of moon ejected by meteoroid strikesScientists now hope to return to the Moon and learn more about what is happening to it. The Trump administration has ordered Nasa to head back as soon as it can, and hopes to have astronauts back on its surface in five years.For me, these findings emphasize that we need to go back to the moon, Schmerr said. We learned a lot from the Apollo missions, but they really only scratched the surface. With a larger network of modern seismometers, we could make huge strides in our understanding of the moon\u0027s geology.This provides some very promising low-hanging fruit for science on a future mission to the moon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several reported that the screen flickered and froze after being folded and unfolded a number of times.In March Samsung claimed to have overcome any issues with the folding screen, releasing a video showing an elaborate testing process\u0026nbspto prove the durability of the new smartphone.According to the tech giant, a Galaxy Fold device could withstand 200,000 folds and unfolds - the equivalent of 100 folds per day for five years - without breaking.Samsung subjected the device to several rounds of extensive tests in its state-of-the-art reliability labs to make sure that the Galaxy Fold is ready to come to market, Samsung wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbspWhile the extent of the test may seem like overkill to some, Samsung viewed it as vital to ensuring the durability of the device\u0027s hinged design and Infinity Flex Display.Samsung is yet to provide an exact release date for the problematic phone, though DJ Koh\u0027s comments to The Korea Herald suggest it will be before the end of May deadline that the firm originally laid out to customers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is incredibly rare to find sea life trapped in amber because the\u0026nbspfossilised resin is produced by\u0026nbspland-based trees.The find was a big surprise, Professor Bo Wang from\u0026nbspNanjing\u0026nbspInstitute of Geology and Palaeontology told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspWe never imagined we would find an ammonite in amber. This is the first record of ammonite in amber, and also the first marine macrofossil in amber.\u0026nbspAll the shells in the amber are empty and have no soft tissue, according to researchers at the institute\u0026nbspfrom the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They believe this proves\u0026nbspthe organisms were long dead by the time they were engulfed in the resin.NIGPAS)The outer shell of the ammonite is also broken and the entrance is full of sand. Scientists believe it would have washed up on a sandy beach covered with shells that was close to resin-producing trees.\u0026nbspThe sample also contains flying insects which were probably trapped by the resin as it was pouring out of the tree.As, the ammonite which is\u0026nbsp33mm\u0026nbsplong, 9.5mm wide,\u0026nbsp29mm\u0026nbsphigh and weighs 6.08g,\u0026nbspflowed down the trunk it trapped organisms near the foot of the tree and when it reached the beach it entombed the shells.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Money for old bones: Dinosaur fossils become big business Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The amber also contains other marine fauna such as sea snails and sea\u0026nbspslaters.\u0026nbspOf the terrestrial fauna found in the amber, mites are the most abundant, according to the paper\u0026nbsppublished in PNAS.\u0026nbspFossils of massive ‘lion’ larger than polar bear discovered in KenyaScientists enraged as T-Rex skeleton is put on eBay for £2.25mScientists used X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to obtain high-resolution images of the ammonite.It is the same as the X-ray examination in the hospital, but the resolution is much higher, Prof\u0026nbspWang said.\u0026nbspHe added: We took several thousands of images and combined them together to get a 3D photo. Micro-CT is also a non-destructive testing, so it does not destroy the amber.Researchers found the ammonite was a juvenile Puzosia (Bhimaites) living during the late Albian-early Cenomanian age. Its presence in the amber helped scientists date the deposit.It also shows that a\u0026nbspMyanman\u0026nbspamber forest existed\u0026nbspnear a dynamic coastal environment\u0026nbsp99-million-year-old.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with a cunning twist of using some form of proportional voting to try to avoid all options being defeated, as happened last time.However, few in government believe they will find a way through, without Labour backing.

When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itA Labour spokesman said simply that the shadow cabinet and trade unions would be updated on what has been discussed.And Downing Street said:\u0026nbsp“In preparation for an update to Cabinet tomorrow, today’s meeting took stock across the range of issues discussed in talks over the last few weeks. We continue to seek to agree a way forward in order to secure our orderly withdrawal from the EU.”Tuesday\u0027s Cabinet meeting is expected to feature a substantial debate on the state of talks, with some Tories warning that Ms May has no prospect of securing a deal which could win the backing of her own party.Some urged her to stand down after the May 23 Euro-elections, which polls suggest will deliver a drubbing for her party.The latest YouGov study for The Times put the Tories on just 10 per cent\u0026nbspfor the European poll, in an unprecedented fifth place behind Liberal Democrats and Greens. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party enjoyed a comfortable lead on 34 per cent,\u0026nbspahead of\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s\u0026nbsp16 per cent.Ms May will be pressed to set out a timetable for her departure when she meets the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee on Thursday, amid speculation that they will clear the way for an early no-confidence vote if she refuses.One member of the 1922 executive, Nigel Evans, said he hoped\u0026nbspMs May will use Thursday’s meeting to ask chairman Sir Graham Brady to fire the starting pistol in the race to replace her.Are the cross-party Brexit talks near collapse and what happens next?Asked whether he expected a Tory humiliation in the May 23 vote, Mr Evans said: Humiliation? No, it\u0027s worse than that.”Leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at the complete vacuum of leadership at Westminster, and pleaded with Tory voters to stick with the party in order to provide a base for a new leader to rebuild.And former minister Ed Vaizey said Ms May should go after the Euro-elections, naming Michael Gove as his preferred replacement.“The only thing I can see that would keep her in office would be if by some miracle she can produce a deal with Labour and argue that she needs time to see if she can get it through Parliament,” he told Channel 4 News.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said it was crunch week for the cross-party negotiations, but rejected the possibility of a second referendum as “a betrayal of what people voted for”.But Sir Keir Starmer, warned it would be “impossible”\u0026nbspto get an agreement through Parliament without the promise of a confirmatory ballot, as up to 150 Labour MPs would reject it.And Mr Watson\u0026nbspsaid it would be “very, very difficult” to construct a deal which could secure Commons approval without a referendum.In direct contradiction of close Corbyn ally Barry Gardiner’s insistence that Labour was “not a remain party”, Mr Watson said it was “a remain and reform party” in the context of the Euro-elections.Their stance puts them at odds with Mr Corbyn’s position that a second referendum remains an option only to prevent no-deal or a “damaging Tory Brexit”.One Labour opponent of a People’s Vote, backbencher Stephen Kinnock, warned that talks risk being “torpedoed” if Labour introduced an “additional red line” of a second referendum.Campaigning in Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Farage denounced calls for a confirmatory referendum as “the most outrageous proposal I\u0027ve ever seen”.He said Labour was “vulnerable in the most extraordinary way” in Leave areas and predicted a second referendum could pave the way for a\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspParty majority at the next general election.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are in a multipolar world without the assurance provided by unquestioned American dominance.”The only way to “defend Enlightenment values” was to invest in cyberwarfare and “the immense capabilities of artificial intelligence will transform the conduct of warfare”.Mr Hunt added: “Our aim, as ever, is to deter and avoid the horror of war in the knowledge that strength is the surest guarantee of peace.“The outcome of such investment should demonstrate beyond doubt that, when we say Britain stands for the defence of democratic values, when we promise never to leave our great ally, the United States, to perform this task alone, then we are as good as our word.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

but he clearly still have reservations.The shadow Brexit secretary is seen as one of the influential voices backing a second referendum, working behind the scenes to shift Labour towards a carefully construction position.In his strongest intervention yet, Sir Keir said\u0026nbspprobably 120 if not 150 of the party\u0027s 229 MPs could vote against the deal unless it was linked to a second referendum.He said: I\u0027ve made it clear that at this stage, at this eleventh\u0026nbsphour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote.Sir Keir has also been clear that any referendum must have an option to remain on the ballot paper.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has traditionally been in the Eurosceptic camp but he has been open to discussions with backbenchers over pursuing a fresh public vote.His first pursuit will always be a general election but he moved the dial by saying Labour would inevitably back a second referendum if an election was not possible.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s influential deputy leader played his cards close to his chest for a while.However Mr Watson\u0026nbsphas since come out a second referendum, arguing that Labour cannot sit on the fence of such an important issue.The shadow culture secretary has kept the pressure on Mr Corbyn, making several high-profile interventions in favour of a fresh public vote.The shadow home secretary is a close ally of Mr Corbyn, and has remained aligned to\u0026nbspthe Labour leader on all things Brexit.Last year, Ms Abbott warned pro-EU\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto be careful what they wished for, as she said\u0026nbspLeave was likely to win if there was a new Brexit referendum.She recently said Labour\u0027s attempt\u0026nbspto appeal to both sides was courageous and principled in the face of criticism that the party was sitting on the fence.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry\u0026nbsphas been a voice for a second referendum in the shadow cabinet.As well as speaking out about the need for a public vote, she has also been clear that an option to remain in the EU should be on the ballot paper.Ms Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is also a close ally of the Labour leader.\u0026nbspShe has publicly expressed her reservations about a second referendum, and also hinted that Labour could sign up to a Brexit deal without a confirmatory vote.The outspoken international trade secretary famously described Labour\u0027s Brexit policy as bollocks.Mr Gardiner recently said Labour was not a remain party now and it had accepted the result of the referendum.A former frontbencher, Ms Cooper resigned from the shadow cabinet in protest at Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership.Now the chair of the home affairs committee, Ms Cooper has become an effective backbench campaigner against a no-deal Brexit.However she has never explicitly supported a second referendum.The Brexit committee chairman has made his support for a public vote known, saying it is the only way to break the Brexit deadlock.Mr Benn\u0026nbspalso spoke in favour of having remain as an option on the ballot paper.The Labour Party chairman is openly opposed to a second referendum, defying an order from Mr Corbyn to back it in a series of Commons votes.He said:\u0026nbsp“There were 17.4m people who voted to leave the European Union.Any attempt to try to cast their vote aside, as if they didn’t mean it or didn’t understand the consequences, whereas everybody else did, is a bit of a slur on the iniduals who took the time to vote, many of them for the first time.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they would. And there ARE Tory Remainiacs who, in their religious zeal to engineer a second chance to halt Brexit, appear ready to shred everything : their Government, their party and their own jobs.The EU, justiably emboldened, now brazenly interferes in our politics.The EU Parliament’s odious Guy Verhofstadt campaigns alongside Vince “B***ocks to Democracy” Cable of the Lib Dems. Donald Tusk tells Brussels to give us enough time for a second vote he is certain would overturn the first.They’re cocksure . . . they have done this so often where, after all. Yet they simply have no grasp of the rage among British voters — both Leavers and former Remainers are determined to uphold our democracy.That was the Government’s goal too once. Now  We’re not sure.In  days the Brexit Party can put the EU and its Westminster stooges straight.EVEN now the Tories could save themselves with a new leader.Unlike Theresa May, he or she needs to be determined to exit the EU with no dealnecessary — AND sell it to MPs.That may look the tallest of tall orders.But civil service preparations have made huge strides. The worst effects can be mitigated. Many Remainer MPs still spread panic about it, knowing only that they are meant to.The new Tory leader must back No Deal, or use the genuine threat of it to improve Mrs May’s deal with the EU.It is indeed the party’s only chance.A MEASURE of how far our once great Parliament has sunk is that Labour MP Richard Burgon may soon run the justice system.Five years ago this thick Corbynista called Zionism, the right of Jews to their homeland, “the enemy of peace”. “I am proud to say,” he crowed, “I wouldn’t be a member of ‘Labour Friends of Israel’.”Then the spotlight fell on his party’s anti-Semitism. Burgon denied saying any of it, only for footage to turn up revealing he did. But the Shadow Justice Secretary insists his denials weren’t lies. He just forgot what he’d said.So that’s OK, then.Imagine our future under Corbyn’s prejudice-fuelled mob: With Marxists casually spitting out bile, making ­denials, then excuses.And this one would run our courts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must try to find a balance.The royals have long-established traditions and do not like change.But given how intense le is for new parents, who can blame Meghan and Harry for wanting to enjoy it alone for a bit Most women avoid cameras for weeks after giving birth. So having a photo taken, under pressure to look gorgeous, scrutinised from every angle, just a couple of days after giving birth  That is a huge ask.I didn’t get out of my pyjamas for a week both times after I had children.Harry and Meghan did a fantastic job introducing Archie to the world.I loved how Harry carried his baby in, already the hands-on father he wants to be, alight with the joy of new fatherhood.However, it was impossible not to think about how wonderful Diana would have been as a grandmother.The birth of a son must be bittersweet for Harry, knowing Diana will never meet Archie.While some grumbled about the two-day wait to show off the baby, others recommend a “babymoon” for parents to shut out the rest of the world and bond with their baby for a week or two.Something tells me that would have been Meghan and Harry’s preference, so this was a compromise.They understand they are public figures.Archie is seventh in line to the throne and his parents know that taxpayers, who in part pay their salary, expected to meet the baby at some point.Most of us only wish to send our love, wish the new parents well and share the moment with them.Within hours of the birth, Meghan’s half-sister had suggested the new arrival meant Meghan was morally obliged to reconnect with her father, Thomas Markle.Let’s be clear. Meghan doesn’t have to do any such thing.She is better off without a father she can’t trust.If your own family are not up to scratch, you make your own based on love, trust and happiness.Given how happy Meghan and Harry look with Archie, they are doing just fine with that.A couple of things really stood out for me about the way they introduced their baby to the world.First, didn’t Meghan look amazing in her Grace Wales Bonner-designed dress I love the fact she chose white, which clearly showed her post-baby bump.She knows what a role model is.And she knows better than to create unrealistic aspirations for women who have just given birth.After all, most mothers still have the bump for at least a few weeks after having a baby.Then there was the look of sheer happiness on the Queen’s face as she looked down at her new great-grandson.Even with her many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she radiated a delight she shares with grandmothers up and down the land.It was just beautul to behold.MAMMA mia! Looking at the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue – featuring model and entrepreneur Tyra Banks – it’s impossible to believe Tyra’s first cover was  years ago and she came out of “modelling retirement” for the shoot.The very idea of wearing a yellow string bikini – at any age, let alone  – is unimaginable to most of us mere mortals.Butyou’ve got it, flaunt it . . . and Tyra certainly still has it.I AM increasingly convinced the only way to grow old gracefully is simply to accept that it’s happening.So I feel bad for Katie Price, who at  had another facelt last month in Turkey.On Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain, the ex-model discussed her “addiction” to plastic surgery.She explained how she had her own fat injected under her eyes and had the side of her face “lted” in a bid to look more youthful.It sounds horric. Choosing to have serious surgery to look a bit younger is baffling.Maybe she feels defined by her looks and will do anything to hang on to them.When I look at pictures of Katie or watch her on TV, I wish she would be kinder to herself and love herself more.She should worry more about how she feels than how she looks.She needs a best friend – someone who knows everything about her and still loves her – to tell her to stop scratching the wrong itch.Katie should give up the plastic surgery and learn to love herself the way she are . . . wrinkles and all.NOT sure I’ll be taking up Lisa Snowdon’s tip for keeping an eye on how much she eats – using chopsticks for every meal instead of a kne and fork.The TV presenter, , says they slow down her eating, so she feels full more quickly.But whatyou are having soup I HAD a chuckle about the fact that Gregg Wallace’s favoured comment on his we Anne-Marie’s Instagram account is the suggestion that she print out a photo.Someone has compiled a mega-tweet of the many times he has commented on his -year-old partner’s photos, demanding she “print it”.When it comes to social media, that sort of defeats the object.Gregg, I feel for you. It’s hard getting older – and it sucks not understanding the modern way of doing things.WHEN Donald Trump refused to publish his tax s, I assumed it was because he didn’t want people to know how much money he had.It turns out it was because he had so little.His tax s reveal he “lost more money than almost any other American taxpayer for a decade, after his hotels and casinos racked up .BILLION dollars in losses”.So not quite the billionaire he claims he is . . .  or the ace businessman.PERHAPS the most surprising news of this week is that although more alcohol is now being drunk around the world, we Brits are not responsible for the rise.We call them snowflakes but, very often, the young people I meet are much more focused and impressive than my generation ever was.APPARENTLY it’s not just booze we Brits are giving up. Thanks to technology, we are now having less SEX than ever before, too.A major study found there has been a steep decline in rates of intimacy since , with fewer than half of Britons now having sex once a week.Scientists said that “le in the digital age” was partly to blame – with couples now too distracted by Netflix, social media or their phones to focus on each other.But seriously,you prefer Netflix or your phone to sex with your partner... well, it’s time for a orce, I’d say.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the minimum NATO spending target – to %, or an extra £bn a year.Mr Hunt’s intervention risks a fresh Cabinet row by infuriating new Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt.Neither she nor No were briefed on Mr Hunt’s speech until a few hours before he made it, it also emerged.One Cabinet source dubbed it “poor form”, as well as a tit-for-tat invitation for others to “have views on his brief”.Issuing a broad vision for post-Brexit Britain that ranged well beyond his brief, Mr Hunt also hinted tax cuts will be needed once we quit the EU – issuing a call to “put fuel in the engine of the British economy”.Mr Hunt also warned that a nuke deal row raised risks of an Iran-US war “by accident” — ahead of his talks with White House Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.His defence pledge received a warm welcome from former-forces Tory MPs.Ex-Army officer-turned Johnny Mercer said: “If we are to be the party of defence, it’s about time we proved it with the proper resourcing”.Yes, Labour: The party run by delusional peacenik Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to scrap our nuclear deterrent and cannot see “any circumstances” in which he would deploy troops.The man who said: “Wouldn’t it be wonderfulevery politician, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, abolished their army ”Yet somehow, as Government cuts let our military strength wither, Labour’s defence spokeswoman Nia Grfith managed to talk tougher on nukes, troop numbers and spending than the Tories.So Jeremy Hunt’s latest salvo is a very welcome statement of intent.It is vital, the Foreign Secretary says, that we stand with America in defending the West’s democracies against the new, rising threats from an “aggressive” Russia and “assertive” China. And against new forms of war entirely.That, he says, means a sharp increase in spending to avoid our US allies fearing they are propping up Nato alone.It will set an example to EU nations who underspend and take for granted their safety, underwritten by American might.“Strength is the surest guarantee of peace,” Mr Hunt says. That’s dead right.It’s a simple concept old hippies like Corbyn, inclined instead to capitulate and hope for mercy, will never grasp.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Among these cases, a large proportion is related to a disruption of this neuronal pathway commonly known as the melanocortin pathway.We observed the deletion of the ACBP gene in astrocytes of the arcuate nucleus promotes obesity.In mice that were genetically modied to be obese, we observed in the laboratory that injecting them daily with ACBP led to a reduction of food intake and weight loss in the order of  per cent over five days - a mechanism that relies on the activation of POMC neurons.Uncovering the neurological causes of obesity could combat one of the biggest health problems in the world.It affects one-in-four adults in the UK and more than a third in the US - potentially leading to diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, musculoskeletal disorders and premature death.Although its driven by environmental factors - such as limitless access to sugar and fat-laden foods and increasingly sedentary lestyles - not everyone becomes overweight.It has been estimated genetics contribute up to  percent towards a persons vulnerability to piling on the pounds.Most mutations occur in the hypothalamus - a region of grey matter that monitors levels of the hormone leptin that is secreted by fat cells.Prof Alquier and colleagues said staying in shape is more brain-related than previously thought - regardless of exercise levels or food intake.He pointed out the study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation is at the basic research stage and was carried out in laboratory experiments on mice.Prof Alquier urged caution in translating the findings to humans. But he said they may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for obesity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Initial figures suggest at least  people were turned away from polling stations across eight of the ten regions targeted to test out the plan. Some  voters were turned away in Derby alone. And on average  voters failed to vote in each pilot this year, an increase from  in pilots held around last year’s local elections. Dferent voter ID schemes are on trial in each region, each requiring some combination of photo ID or other kinds of ID. On election night the Mirror revealed an -year-old woman was denied the right to vote in Pendle, where a total of  people were turned away. The pensioner attacked the “stupid” system after taking a taxi to her local polling station in Pendle, Lancashire, only to be told she couldn’t vote. She told the Mirror she brought a photograph of herself, rather than a photo ID, after she misunderstood the instructions.   Cat Smith, Labour ’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement, said: As we feared, legitimate and honest voters have been denied their right to vote because of these undemocratic and unpopular pilot schemes.Time and time again Labour has warned that Voter ID will make it harder for people to vote but the Conservatives have pushed on with their blatant attempt to rig the result of future elections by voter suppression. After another round of shambolic pilot schemes, itaposs clear that Voter ID has no place in our democracy and should be abandoned immediately. It came as a cross-party letter urged ministers to abandon the plan, saying it would disproportionately affect vulnerable people and communities and was an attempt at voter suppression.”   The letter, from Labour, the Liberal Democrats , SNP , Plaid Cymru and the Green Party read: “The Windrush scandal has demonstrated very clearly that it can be more dficult for some communities to provide official documentation than others.“As representatives of major opposition parties, we believe that what is really going on here is a blatant attempt by the Conservatives to rig the result of future elections by making it harder for people to vote – it’s voter suppression. “At a time when millions of people are missing from the electoral register, we won’t allow this government to close down our democracy. “In light of the overwhelming evidence base, we are of the collective view that these dangerous voter ID trials must be scrapped as a matter of urgency.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt demands more cash","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt demands more cash for military as Tory leadership battle escalatesThe Foreign Secretary used a major policy speech to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet at London’s Mansion House to back calls for extra cash for the militaryShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsHunt is seen as a front runner to replace Theresa May at No \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Jeremy Hunt has demanded a hike in defence spending as he launched the latest salvo in his thinly-veiled bid to succeed Theresa May .The Foreign Secretary used a major policy speech to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet at London’s Mansion House to back calls for extra cash for the military - a key plea from high-profile Conservative backbenchers. Britain is one of a handful of NATO nations to meet the alliance benchmark of pumping % of GDP into its Armed Forces – and a host of prominent Tory backbenchers want a lt. Many see it as a rallying point for hawkish right-wingers, and a potential party leadership candidate would boost their hopes by pressing for a rise.    Warning of the mounting threats from “more aggressive Russia and a more assertive China”, Mr Hunt said: “I believe it is time for the next Strategic Defence and Security Review to ask whether, over the coming decade, we should decisively increase the proportion of GDP we devote to defence. “Any additional funds would of course need to be for new capabilities and not simply plugging gaps in existing plans – and our aim, as ever, is to deter and avoid the horror of war in the knowledge that strength is the surest guarantee of peace. “The outcome of such investment should demonstrate beyond doubt that when we say Britain stands for the defence of democratic values, when we promise never to leave our great ally, the United States, to perform this task alone then we are as good as our word and in doing so we encourage other democracies who share our values to follow suit.” Just seven of  NATO countries meet the % guideline, despite mounting demands from Donald Trump for European states to stump up more cash. The US injected .% of GDP into defence last year, with the UK hitting .%.    But the Commons Defence Committee, retired top brass and a host of senior Tories have ramped up calls for extra money. Being seen as sympathetic to those pleas will boost Mr Hunt’s chances of claiming the Conservative crown when Mrs May finally quits No. Mr Hunt, who meets NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, has yet to confirm he will run to replace the Prime Minister. Declared hopefuls so far include International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom and former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey.

The Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee accuses the Government of overlooking sporting and cultural activities in favour of arresting and jailing youngsters over Britain’s blade culture. Walking, football and choral singing could also be key to solving social problems in health, education and urban regeneration, it claims. The report recommends that sport and culture are “better integrated within the work and policy objectives” of Whitehall departments to make them a “mainstream” way of delivering policy. Committee chairman Damian Collins said: “We cannot break the debilitating cycle of gang violence and kne crime just by arresting those who commit offences.    “Government statistics clearly show that custodial sentences in and of themselves do not necessarily rehabilitate young offenders. “In schools we have seen that sport and culture can improve educational attainment as well as the well-being of the students. “Social activities like group singing and walking football can improve the mental and physical health of those who take part. “More needs to be done to co-ordinate and invest in community initiatives, share evidence of success and encourage others to emulate examples of best practice.” The report highlights boxing and martial arts programmes as particularly useful in reaching young people, and calls for a Government review of their effectiveness in prisons.

I spoke to the checkout girl and gave her the serial number of the ticket. She inputted it and said: ‘Well done, you’ve won...three lucky dips’. I asked hershe was sure, and then I asked to speak to a manager. I am absolutely gutted. I thought, ‘this is it, it’s for real, my numbers have come up’. I never thought to check my numbers, I didnapost think a company as large as Camelot could have got it wrong, I didnapost understand.    His roller-coaster ride to riches and back began on Wednesday evening when he had his lotto card checked at the Farnworth Tesco store, Lancs., - a store where he worked earlier in his career. Dean said: “I’d gone in to do a bit of shopping and I thought I’d check to see how I’d gone on in the previous Saturday’s draw. “All the other staff applauded me. “The receipt said I’d won a prize, that the store would not be able to pay it out and that I should contact Camelot immediately.” Unfortunately, the phone lines were closed for the night so Dean went online and learned that he had potentially won at least £,. He then set about about sharing the good news with his nearest and dearest. When the Camelot phone lines reopened at am on Thursday an excited Dean, who is currently in the process of renovating his £, home, made the phone call he thought would change his le for ever. It emerged that because the Wednesday lottery draw was in progress while Dean had his Saturday ticket checked, the checkout girl got that particular receipt message.  Dean said: When I had purchased the ticket I had bought one for both the Saturday and Wednesday draw. As the Wednesday draw was in the process of taking place, it looks like this was an automated message instead which would have been given for any win. I was absolutely gutted. It is back to the drawing board now. A spokesman for Camelot said: “In this instance, the player attempted to claim a prize during a aposdraw breakapos, when National Lottery sales are suspended while a draw takes place. The prize couldn’t be paid out at that time - because the ticket was still entered into a aposliveapos draw - so a validation slip was printed instead. To clary, this generic slip is used for a number of scenarios - itaposs not exclusively used for high-tier prizes. Poor Dean was relieved he had the day off on Thursday so he didnapost have to face his colleagues . He said: I just watched television and my mum made me some comfort food, which wasnapost much comfort.

That’s because Geordie student Alisha, now , who was duly announced as Miss England, had been suffering hearing loss for four years. “It was very scary,” she recalls. “I was OK with one-on-one ­conversations indoors, but I ­struggled to keep upI was talking to two or more people. When I was in a crowded place, everything was just noise to me and I could never make voices and conversations out.“I’d go completely deaf outside in windy weather and wouldn’t go to a rock concert or anything really loud. It was annoying and embarrassing because I’d have to ask people to repeat themselves.“When I was asked a question by the Miss England judges, I had to ask for that to be repeated.”    Alisha, who was born in ­Gateshead and raised in Newcastle, recalls, “In , I noticed that my hearing was going in one ear. The problem came and went. I was only  and assumed it was temporary. But when I hit  it became worse so I visited my GP. He checked my ear health and said it was fine. “The problem got worse but I was told repeatedly there was nothing wrong.” Then, last August, just before her th birthday, Alisha visited Boots for a hearing test. She wasn’t prepared for the news that she had premature hearing loss in both of her ears. “I knew I had an issue with my right ear, which is why I had gone for help, but apparently my right ear was only slightly worse than my left, which I hadn’t realised. The audiologist performed the test twice because he couldn’t believe that an -year-old could have such bad hearing loss.” Alisha was devastated. “I was told my hearing could stay that way forever, or it could deteriorate further. I was shocked. I thought I was too young for something like this to happen.” At the time, Alisha was studying Crime Scene Investigation And Forensic Science at Teesside University, hoping to become a detective.    She had no idea how the diagnosis would affect her future. The audiologist referred her on to an ear specialist for further investigations, so she simply had to wait. Her confidence was knocked, and Alisha almost didn’t compete in the Miss England competition the following month for fear her dficulties would hold her back, but finally resolved to go for it. “I decided that I couldn’t let it get me down,” she explains. “I began to learn sign language and to lip read, sothe worst was to happen I’d have options and it would not be the end of the world. I’ll be honest, I’m still not great at signing.” Since taking the title, Alisha has been busy fulfilling official duties as Miss England, all the while still waiting for her appointment with the specialist. So when, during an interview on BBC Breakfast in April this year, Alisha had to ask co-hosts Louise Minchin and Dan Walker to repeat their questions, her hearing ­problems were spotted by an employee of private healthcare company Hidden Hearing, who invited her into the company’s Newcastle branch for further tests. “They told me the problem could be ­hereditary, that I could have been born with damage to the tiny bones in my ears, or perhaps I’d hit my head as a child which could cause damage to the nerves or bones. “If my problem is to do with the bones rather than nerves it’s unlikely to get worse. An operation could fix them but that comes with the risk of nerve damage. I felt that, for me, the best option was hearing aids.” Hidden Hearing fitted Alisha with their Oticon Opn S hearing aids, which – unlike traditional aids which restrict focus to one sound at a time – give your brain access to more sounds around you. “I wear them all the time, except when I go to sleep,” says Alisha. “They’re making a massive ­dference. Now I can even hear what somebody behind me is saying. They’re also discreet, but I wouldn’t be embarrassedpeople know I wear them. Lots of people lose their hearing.” “I will probably have to wear hearing aids for the rest of my le, but I’m fine about that,” she adds. “They’re already making my le so much better.”For further information, visit hiddenhearing "},{"url":null,"title":"moped gang exposed amanda holden","story":"NewsMoped gang exposed by Amanda Holden caught in dramatic CCTV as theyre jailedFootage of a police chase around the streets of London has been released by the politan Police after members of the gang were jailed for a total of  yearsShareCommentsByHelen William:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video moped-gang-who-terried-amanda-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe moment a brazen moped gang who have been jailed for a string of bold professional, planned and organised high profile raids across London were caught has been captured in dramatic CCTV footage. One of their crimes was a shocking attempted robbery where a mother was threatened with her three-year-old being snatched away from her. Footage went viral after being circulated on social media by Britainaposs Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, who asked the public to call  or u know these scumbags. Now the politan Police has released CCTV of a police chase of a moped, which can be seen swerving around the streets. The chase then continues on foot before they are finally caught. Among the bold crimes committed by the gang between July  and June  was the theft of BBC camera equipment filming the Oxford versus Cambridge boat race. Judge Georgina Kent told the -strong gang, who were crowded into the dock at Kingston Crown Court: Many offences were committed using motorbikes or mopeds, often stolen with  number plates. Many offences offences were committed at night. She added: The motorbike helmets and clothing, often all in black, were an effective disguise and created an intimidating appearance. The motorbikes provided a quick getaway. Many of these offences were committed in public view because you were confident you could get away with it.    In what the judge described as an exceptionally serious and shocking attempted robbery which had a degree of planning, four gang members were caught on CCTV targeting a woman with a young child in broad daylight in Richmond. Pheobe Ruele was walking hand-in-hand with her son whom she had just picked up from nursery when two motorcycles road past, pulled into the road and waited for her on June  last year. The court heard that John McFadyen, , grabbed her arm hard enough to leave finger-mark bruises and told her: Give me your rings. Iaposm going to hurt your child and take him away. Footage shows the terried woman dragging her child into the road before builders chase the gang away, brandishing scaffolding poles.  The judge noted that fortunately there were no cars in the vicinity at that moment but added that Ms Ruele is now afraid for her childrenaposs safety when she takes them to and from school. The judge said she had no doubt this offence would have struck fear into any parent who heard about it. The judge added: A mother and her three-year-old son are extremely vulnerable. The threats that were made were calculated to exploit that vulnerability. To threaten a mother with violence towards a very young child and threaten to take the child away is a most effective and distressing threat. The footage went viral after being circulated on social media by Britainaposs Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, who asked the public to call  or u know these scumbags.  Taking the gang off the streets has helped cut moped-enabled crime in the capital by % in the space of a year, according to the politan Police. The defendants, who are aged between  and , also used their mopeds to block traffic before taking an angle grinder to cameras rigged up to capture the boat race on March  last year. Although their first attempt on Putney Bridge was interrupted by off-duty police officer Steven Wagstaff, a highly-specialised BBC camera worth an estimated £, was stolen by Barnes Bridge just an hour later. Of the first incident, the judge said: One of the riders rode at Mr Wagstaff, kicking out with his foot. Another threatened to stab him and one of the pillionthreatened to stab him with the angle grinder. The gang escaped empty-handed.  The gang, who were all linked to ringleader Terry Marsh, , were sentenced for offences including conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to burgle,conspiracy to steal, criminal damage and handling stolen goods. Three gang members - Omar Tafat, , Josh Myers, , and Kian Taylor,  - were arrested on May  last year following a high-speed police chase. It lasted more than  minutes and spanned  London boroughs, with all three piled onto the same bike. At one point they even drove the wrong way up the A into oncoming traffic to try to shake off the helicopter, police motorbikes and dog units chasing them. They had arranged for an associate to wait by the roadside with a can of fuel to try to escape. The three, who had tried to film the escapade, were arrested when they crashed by South Ealing Cemetery.    The gang first came to police attention on December   when they carried out a ram-raid on high-end outdoor clothing company Altimus Ltd in High Street Kensington using a stolen Range Rover and several mopeds. They made off with thousands of poundsapos worth of Canada Goose and Nicole Benisti jackets which can retail at up to £,. Within a month, the gang had ed to the same store to carry out a second raid, violently assaulting the security guard hired to protect the premises and throwing him out into the street. The two raids cost the business £, in lost goods, and a total of £, including damage. The judge said the security guard, who was just doing his job, suffered head injuries, bruises to his body and a foot injury. She added: Since then he felt unprotected when he goes to work and he is afraid that something like this could happen again.  Other brazen attacks included spraying a police car with fire foam extinguishers as officers waited for a stolen moped to be collected, and making off with the bike. They also targeted two unmarked police cars, stealing an officeraposs bag from one and smashing another up with a hammer in a bid to do as much damage as possible. In April they raided three Kensington-based businesses, making off with thousands of pounds of electronic equipment - one company alone lost £, worth of MacBooks and other Apple products. Although the majority of their activity was focused in south-west London, four defendants travelled to Redditch in Worcestershire in January last year where they stole three motorbikes worth a total of £, after their owner accidentally posted his address after advertising them on eBay. Investigating officers said the gang were highly forensically aware and managed to carry out a number of raids without leaving any DNA evidence, forcing the police to painstakingly analyse huge volumes of mobile phone data to link the defendants and the offences. Marsh alone had three handsets and  dferent SIM cards in a bid to avoid being tracked down by mobile phone data.    Following the arrest of Tafat, Myers and Taylor in May, a further five gang members were arrested in July last year, with the remaining defendants apprehended after caches of evidence found at their co-conspiratorsapos addresses were analysed. Tafat, , of Fulham, was jailed for a total of eight years and five months after being sentenced for a count of conspiracy to steal, attempted robbery, the theft and attempted theft of BBC cameras, going equipped to steal, criminal damage to a police car and breach of a criminal behaviour order. Myers, , of Shepherds Bush, was sentenced to eight years in a young offenders institution and disqualied from driving. He had pleaded guilty to attempted theft, going equipped to steal, criminal damage to a police car, dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualied, possession of an offensive weapon and conspiracy to steal. He was also found guilty of two further counts of robbery and possession of an offensive weapon at trial.  Taylor, of no fixed address, admitted attempted theft, going equipped to steal, criminal damage to a police car, dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualied and possession of an offensive weapon, and was found guilty of robbery after trial. He was sentenced to a total of nine years and four months at a young offenders institution and given a driving disqualication. Steven Weller, , of Ealing, was given consecutive sentences of  months for conspiracy to rob, four month for conspiracy to steal and  months for conspiracy to burgle, and was sentenced to a total of six years and seven months. The court heard Marsh was supremely organised and diligent in rotating the Sim cards in the telephones he used and was the common denominator in the crime spree. Marsh, of Fulham, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to burgle.    The -year-old was jailed for a total of  years and two months. He was given consecutive sentences of  months for conspiracy to rob,  months for conspiracy to steal and  months for conspiracy to burgle. After admitting a series of offences, Moran, , of Fulham, was give concurrent suspended sentences of two months for conspiracy to steal,  months for conspiracy to burgle and a month for handling stolen goods. He was given a total sentence of  months, suspended for  months with a six-month curfew. John McFadyen, , of Feltham, was jailed for  months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob, while his brother Isaac, , admitted conspiracy to rob was sentenced to  months in a young offenders institution.  Mitchell Leaver,  of Battersea, was given a -month suspended sentence and and a three-month curfew after admitting conspiracy to burgle. Scott Leaver, , of Lambeth, was sentenced to  monthsapos imprisonment after being found guilty of the same charge after trial. The judge sentenced Aaron Pask, , of White City, to a total of six years and eight months after his convictions for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to steal and burglary. Ram Monk, , of no fixed address, was sentenced to two years and eight months after being found guilty of conspiracy to burgle.

An inquest heard Stephanie had given birth to her first daughter in March  and been diagnosed with postnatal depression three months later as her daughter suffered with colic. But her family saw no warning signs that she was planning to take her own le.    She had been out for lunch with a relative and her daughter at the Weathervane pub, in Meir Park, on the day of her death. In a statement read out at yesterdayaposs inquest, Stephanieaposs partner James Walton said: Iaposve been in a relationship with Steph for  months. We found out we were having a baby together, moved in together, and were so happy. Following the birth of our daughter, Steph suffered with postnatal depression. Our daughter was having stomach problems and we discovered she had a dairy intolerance. It was a hard time for both of us, especially waking up every two hours, we didnapost know what was wrong. Steph was admitted to a parent and baby unit to receive some support. It started to become easier and Steph went back to work as a carer at UK Care Management. She loved caring for people, although she did not enjoy the long hours. It restricted time with her daughter as she did -hour shts two days a week. This was due to change to three days, that was the only thing playing on Stephaposs mind, she just wanted to be a mum. The inquest heard Stephanie had attempted to kill herself twice before and her dad committed suicide when she was a child. James last saw her alive at am on March  when he made her a cup of tea and took their baby into her. Stephanie and the relative shared three bottles of wine during their meal at the Weathervane. They then walked to Tesco, at Meir Park, before the relative took Stephanieaposs daughter home. A dog-walker saw Stephanie sitting cross-legged on the bridge at .pm on March . She said: She turned to me and smiled. She looked very well presented and did not look upset. So I carried on walking my dog. I looked back but carried on walking down and I called  and then  to raise concerns. But the inquest heard Stephanie fell to her death before the police could arrive. The dog-walker added: I didnapost have time to go over. Recording a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Sarah Murphy said: I want to stress that having heard the evidence of Mr Walton there was absolutely no way that Mr Walton, or any of her family, could have known that that was her intention. We heard she had a lovely time in the afternoon, there was absolutely no indication that that was going through her mind. I hope her family and friends go away knowing there was nothing they could have done to prevent this. She was taking medication and had sought help. She was a good mother and had ed to work, doing the best she could for her family.If you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available   by calling   "},{"url":null,"title":"mum three 45 loses three","story":"NewsMum-of-three, , loses three stone by ditching bread and butterDawne Dickey, from Belfast, dropped an incredible four dress sizes after changing her dietShareCommentsBySarah Scott:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMum Dawne has lost three stone after ditching one thing from her diet \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three has lost three stone by ditching her biggest vice - bread and butter.

Beth Martin, , was training to become part of the UKaposs Border Force when she had an unexpected arrival. Unaware she was expecting, the size six student had been undertaking extreme physical activity such as army and police riot training throughout her pregnancy - and during her labour. Known as a aposcryptic pregnancyapos, Bethaposs baby Maizie, now seven months old, had grown behind Bethaposs ribs, showing no physical bump - and has even failed to show up on two pregnancy tests. Staying the same size for the entire duration of her pregnancy, Beth, from St Anneaposs, Blackpool had put tiredness down to her intensive training.   And when she finally went into labour, she put contraction pains down to a severe case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome .Beth said, Iaposd taken a pregnancy tests two months before Maizie was born in October, . Someone at work had said I looked pregnant and I remember thinking how rude she was. I was doing a course into unormed public services and had my heart set on becoming part of Border Force. My education was sport based, about  hours a week of intense physical activity. The week before Iaposd had Maizie, I was doing riot police force training, where I had horses chasing me - it seemed surreal.  Beth had noticed she had gained a small amount of weight, and became breathless easily - but all the pregnancy tests she took came back negative. When she began getting stabbing pains in her abdomen after training at college, Beth rang NHS  for advice. After realising Beth was spotting, the call handler quickly realised the teen was in labour and sent her straight to A+E. Little Maizie Loraine Martin was born after  hours of labour,  hours of pushing  less than  hours preparation for Beth, weighing lbs oz. Beth added, By the time I got to the hospital I was in so much pain.  A nurse told me straight away I looked pregnant - and then I discovered Iaposve been in labour for  hours. I had seven hours to prepare for the fact I was about to become a mum. My two older brothers - Leo,  and Liam , both thought I was playing a prank.

And forecasters believe tomorrow, Wednesday, will be even hotter at C. There will be some winds in southern coastal areas but much of the UK will be basking in sunshine today. Unusually, those in the Highlands of Scotland could be the warmest of all where temperatures could hit C. According to the Met Office , Tuesday will see high pressure drt further eastwards. It means for a lot of us it will be sunny weather by day - but we will have chilly nights.  Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: “It’s going to be another sunny day. “It will be a bit breezy along the English channel coast but for most places lots of sunshine. “But quite quickly those temperatures will be falling once more and it will turn a bit chilly yet again on Wednesday morning so again expect a fresh start to the day.  Despite that “fresh start” Mr Deakin warned that there will be more sunshine for many across the UK. Meteorologist Craig Snell told The Sun Online: Weaposre going to be expecting very dry weather with plenty of sun within the next three days. The temperature will peak on Wednesday, reaching C in parts of Scotland and northern England. Weaposre going to see some rain creep in the the second half of the week, as temperatures will begin to settle down on Friday.    The Met Office website says: A cold start with frost in places, but soon clearing in the sunshine. Skies will stay mainly clear, except for the odd patch of cloud It will be warm during the afternoon, although a little fresher along some coasts. Wednesdayaposs is similar and reads: After a chilly start it will be another warm, dry and sunny day across the UK.  Some thin, high cloud may turn the sunshine a little hazy in the west. Come Friday however, and periods of rain may signal a slide back into the dreary weather that was cast over the isle last week. An unsettled weekend will see rain, cloud and stronger winds taking daytime temperatures below the seasonal average.

The photographer who took pictures of the scene in Monterey Bay, Calornia, US, joked he would have soiled himself had he been on the fishing vessel. Footage of the spectacle shows a fisherman standing spellbound on the vessel, watching as the whale flies up into the air before plunging back down into the water. Douglas Croft, who captured the moment alongside Kate Cummings, told reporters: It was quite exciting!    Salmon season coincides with the time when humpbacks are ing to Monterey Bay to feed for the summer and there were hundreds of boats on the bay fishing. This whale had breached a couple of times before this and many times they’ll just keep doing it. I went below deck to shoot from a porthole close to the water line. That’s what gives this amazing perspective of looking up at the whale. That the breach was directly behind the fishing boat really shows the size. Since the boat is closer, it should look bigger, but the whale is huge! If I’d been the fisherman, I’d probably need some new underwear.    Kate said she had fun capturing the moment on video, which was filmed shortly after the whale was spotted emerging from the water further away on April . She added: Sometimes when whales breach multiple times, theyaposre also heading a specic direction when theyaposre underwater building momentum for the next breach. I figured the next breach would be around the fisherman because the whale was heading that way and sure enough! Though I didnapost expect the whale and the boat to line up so perfectly.

As much as I’m leader of the club they always help me out in terms of leading the team as much as I do.“There are plenty of boys who could take it on.”Keeper Joe Lewis signed a new five-year deal with Aberdeen two weeks ago and rarely misses a minute for the Dons, while defender Andy Considine – who also committed to the club – is the longest-serving player at Pittodrie.Considine has had a great season, playing mostly at centre-back.Scott McKenna captained Scotland in last summer’s friendlies against Peru and Mexico, as well as skippering Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup final loss to Celtic in Shinnie’s absence.Devlin’s had a stop-start season at Pittodrie after making his comeback from a serious knee injury at the start of the campaign. He joined from Hamilton Accies – where he was club captain – during his recovery last January.Meanwhile, Shinnie delved deeper into his reasons for choosing Derby, with several English Championship sides chasing his signature, as well as a new deal – which would’ve made him the Dons’ best-paid player – on the table at Pittodrie.Derby are in the Premier League play-offs and have a real desire to get back into the world’s richest league, which impressed the Aberdonian.Shinnie said: “I’ve got a chance to go down to a club who are trying to push for the Premier League.“They’ve still got a chance this year, and when I went down and spoke to them it was all about trying to get that promotion.“To have the chance to go down and help them do thatwas important for me. It’s a challenge I’ll look forward to after my business is done here.”Shinnie described the “nice” bonus for a midfielder that Derby are managed by one of England’s best ever in Cha legend Frank Lampard.Lampard – more attack-minded than the combative Shinnie – scored  Premier League goals in  appearances.He was appointed Rams boss – his first chance in the dug-out – at the beginning of this term.Shinnie said: “It’s a nice added bonus to have the calibre of players hewas .

To get a song after being on the pitch for  seconds which was nice! I really enjoyed it and appreciated it from the fans.“They understand my role here and I’m just trying to do my best for the team and the club.“I’m the happiest guy when we win. Maybe when you are younger you don’t celebrate it the same way because you’ve not played, but now I feel I’m genuinely happy. EvenI’m not playing it’s great to be part of the winning side.“You’re always learning as a footballer and I think that should always happen in any job. It’s about improving and learning and goalkeeping isn’t any dferent.“Goalkeeping changes and every year you just want to improve that little part of the game that you’ve not managed to do so yet.

She added: “We need to have designated crossings where we know we are % safe and no bikes.”Aberdeen City Council has said officers will report back to the operational delivery committee on the safety of the area next Thursday.Niall Foley, engagement manager with Guide Dogs Scotland, said: “There is a forthcoming meeting where they will be considering the street design and we would like them to listen to the concerns of people with sight loss, particularly with regards to installing controlled crossings so people with sight loss have a safe and clear space to cross the road.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 06","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIn some ways it is like Groundhog Day, but yet again we are looking at severe cuts in health and social care services.At last week#s Kilmory meeting of the board in charge of these services # see page  # there was frustration at the pace at which these proposed cuts are being brought to the table.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby youngsters lead oban to victory","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowYoung Mid Argyll rugby players Drew Buckley, Anya Gritten and Amber Russell took part in the Glasgow Warriors championship with their Oban U Girls team mates on Wednesday February .The girls won all four of their games, scoring a remarkable  tries and conceding only two.They also played in the first round of the Scottish Cup in Oban against East Kilbride on Sunday February , progressing to the next round after an  impressive - points victory.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

But Auchinleck Estate is carving its own niche in tourism. And its history is every bit as fascinating as nearby Dumfries House Estate. You could argue that renowned biographer James Boswell elevates Auchinleck to even greater signicance than its neighbour. The Boswells had been at Auchinleck for  years before the two rival Georgian ‘big hooses’ were built in the s. “The original Auchinleck House, now a ruin, dates from ,” says historian Billy Cooper. “James IV gave Thomas Boswell the land, but the pair of them were to die together at Flodden in . “There’s an even earlier castle on the estate, and we’re hoping to locate a medieval graveyard.” Billy, , from Ochiltree, along with others, has founded a Friends of Boswell group of volunteers. “It’s a gem of a place –unchanged for centuries, and I just love the history of it all,” he says. Retired policeman Billy has been a guide at Culzean Castle and Dumfries House –but Auchinleck Estate excites him even more. “There’s gothic bridges over gorges, there’s a grotto, and there’s lots more to discover. “When Dr Johnson travelled here in , he had hardly seen a tree since Carlisle, and was impressed with planting done at Auchinleck,” said Billy. Rory Boswell, who runs the farm on Auchinleck Estate, is delighted to have the friends’ group on board. He said: “Since childhood, I’ve loved this wild, rustic place. “We’re the Boswells, we live here, we farm here, we’re still here.” Rory, , recounts a story of two old men, in their s, who used to make tea at the spring, when he was just a lad. He said: “There’s clearly health benefits to people enjoying access to the estate.” The friends are helping to restore gardens and walks that can be enjoyed by all. Rory said: “I have a brother in the army, so I’m pleased that groups like Combat Stress are getting involved.” He is rearing magnicent Highland Cattle, and hopes that one day there will be a steak restaurant alongside the very popular Boswell’s Coach House. Volunteer Mari Welsh, from Auchinleck, says she gets a great feeling of health and well-being from being on the rugged estate. She said: “Boswell was a great writer, and we in the friends group believe we are writing new chapters in the story. “We’re gradually improving the paths and the garden, and we hope tomarshes to ponds.” Mari’s brother, Craig Ferguson, has sketched out ideas of what the estate could become, with enhancements. “There’s so much potential here,” he says. “It’s a truly beautul place on our doorstep.” The friends group are launching guided walks of Auchinleck Estate on Sunday, May . These will leave from the car park at Boswell’s Coach House at .am and .pm.

That gave me a lump in my throat, looking back along the line of children, staff and friends, all making our way to the new school.The new school sits proudly on top of the hill adjacent to Neidpath Road where Mary has been the friendly face that has greeted visitors to the school for nearly a decade.When asked what she loved about the job, Mary said it had been both ldquorewarding and erse. She added: ldquoNo two days are the same.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week we have learned how CCTV has helped detected a serious crime in one Borders town.ldquoThis motion follows a refusal of the councilrsquos chief executive to allow the original report to be procedurally

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

Over the year, the condition of  natural features improved to favourable or recovering condition, while  deteriorated to unfavourable condition.There is little that can be done to reverse some of the sites in trouble, at least at a local level. That is because they are the result of global environmental change, such as declining seabird populations which are thought to be related to changes in prey distribution. Climate change is also believed to be a factor in the decline of a number of sites and poses a long-term threat to Scotlandrsquos nature.However, the SNH report, which coincides with Invasive Species Week, shows that ldquoaliens remain the single biggest reason for features being in unfavourable condition, representing % of all negative pressures, followed by overgrazing .Not all ldquoinvasive species are necessarily foreign . Gorse, bracken and nettles, which occur naturally in Scotland, can be just as destructive as non-native plants and animals such as giant hogweed.They can hurt important habitats and the flora and fauna they support by competing for nutrients and light.SNH has been working with partners across Scotland to address these and other pressures and put important natural sites on the road to recovery.Sally Thomas, SNH Director of People and Nature, said: ldquoItrsquos encouraging to see that the majority of natural features in Scotland are either in good condition or on the road to recovery.ldquoHowever, these findings also clearly illustrate the challenges that nature faces and we know that more needs to be done.ldquoThatrsquos why we are working closely with partners, farmers and landowners to help them to manage sites in a way that tackles invasive species and overgrazing on protected areas and ensures that our natural heritage is safeguarded for future generations.Examples of this work in action include Lower Wick River Site of Special Scientic Interestin Caithness where the control of toxic giant hogweed is making headway, preventing the plants from flowering and resulting in a signicant decline in their numbers, and Ballantrae Shingle Beach SSSI in South Ayrshire, which is also improving following the treatment of invasive Japanese knotweed at the site.At Dumbrock Loch Meadows SSSI a management agreement with the landowner of the largest lowland grassland in Stirlingshire has resulted in better managed grazing, bracken treatment and the removal of Japanese knotweed.Meanwhile at Cleugh SSSI in Dumfries and Galloway the condition of the grassland is recovering following a similar management agreement, one of hundreds, to reduce grazing pressure and remove encroaching scrub and thistles - allowing flowering plants to thrive.SNH is also leading the four-year partnership Scottish Invasive Species Initiativeproject, which is working to control invasive non-native species along riversides in Northern Scotland.SNHrsquos recently announced Bioersity Challenge Fund of up to pound million is also targeting funding at projects that will help our most at-risk habitats and species, connect existing nature reserves and protected areas and tackle invasive species.Not everyone is happy. Labourrsquos Claudia Beamish said the Scottish Government was ldquo continuing to fail our most vulnerable wild places. with improvement ldquoflatlining.She added: ldquoSome of this can be attributed to invasive species but, as the First Minister herself admitted, the government is hitting only  of the  Aichi targets on bioersity and it is patently obvious that the SNP Governmentrsquos actions are not enough."},{"url":null,"title":"young-scots-learning-about-the-nations-history-through-netflix","story":"But yet many young Scots have a very limited knowledge of the key people from the countryrsquos past who helped shape its future.According to a new survey, more than half of  to -year-olds donrsquot know Robert the Bruce led the Scots to victory against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn.The poll of , Scots found  per cent also did not know William Wallace defeated the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, while a similar percentage were unaware Mary Queen of Scots was held prisoner for  years.Asked who invented the television, only  per cent knew it was Helensburgh-born engineer, John Logie Baird and over a third did not know Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes novels.Nearly a third of Scots aged - did not know Burke and Hare murdered people in Edinburgh to sell for medical research.The survey, commissioned by The Edinburgh Dungeon tourist attraction, also shows one in six Scots saying they they did not learn their history at school.Instead, they rely on cinema and television including the recent Mary Queen of Scots film, starring Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, and Netflixrsquo show Outlaw King, with Chris Pine in the title role of Robert the Bruce.Read more:Scottish schools to serve vegan meals after human rights challengeDespite the lack of knowledge, the survey showed Scots of all ages have an appetite to learn more about their history, with  per cent cent saying they would have liked more of the subject at school. However, four in five said it should be taught in a more engaging and interactive way.The lack of awareness of key historical events highlighted by the survey does not surprise Professor Murray Pittock, from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Critical Studies.He said the importance of the study of Scottish history in schools had been eroded over the past  years.ldquoAwareness of Scottish history is poor generally.

There is now a compulsory Scottish question in the history Higher and Scottish Studies has been introduced as part of the Curriculum for Excellence.However, Mr Pittock is concerned that for many people television and film still provides them with their understanding of their own history.ldquoOne of the reasons why there has been such a fuss about films like Braveheart is because it is the way too many people get their history.ldquoPeople should not get all their history through drama. Outlaw King happens to be academically advised and is done to a pretty high standard, but there are a lot of things in it you could question.ldquoA lot of these productions are not historically accurate. They are entertainment and liberties are taken with the facts so people are left with a  understanding.ldquoThe answer is to ensure the widespread teaching of Scottish literature and history in Scottish primary schools and in the early years of secondary school.ldquoBut one of the most important aspects of this is to stop making it a political issue asthis is a Nationalist agenda is totally wrong.

The basis for a referendum was well-documented in .Askedit is, therefore, up to the UK Parliament to decide the limits of devolution, Mr Mundell tells The Herald: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the way in which you are construing that because devolution means that certain matters are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, so like education and health, these are almost a full responsibility.ldquoI put through orders in this Parliament to ensure that policies I donrsquot agree with in Scotland are in force free prescriptions, I didnrsquot agree with that policy at that time. I have put through the orders in this Parliament in relation to devolved matters even though I donrsquot agree with them because I accept the Scottish Parliament has responsibility. On the constitution, it is a matter that is reserved to the Westminster ParliamenthellipldquoThe Scottish Parliament is entitled to express an opinion and a view in relation to other matters but it is not the definitive view of Scotland.The Cabinet minister explains how the nature of devolution means it has limits. ldquoI have never suggested devolution is independence itrsquos not. The judgement the people of Scotland made was: yes devolution of the issues and subsequent issues is the way forward because we have benefited from having two parliaments and from the best of both worlds as it is sometimes construed.Tony Blair: Scotland is right to stay in EU but it would be wrong to leave the UKMr Mundell expresses concern about how voters and, indeed, politicians conflate the Scottish Parliament with the Scottish Government the public mindset, he believes, needs to change.ldquoMost people who have negativities towards the Scottish Parliament, what they mean is they donrsquot like the Scottish Government. Whereas here at Westminster, despite all its flawshellippeople donrsquot think John Bercow is running the country. They understand the House of Commons is dferent from Theresa May and her Government. We havenrsquot sufficiently been able to dferentiate the Scottish Parliament as an institution[from the Scottish Government].Noting how no one is to blame for this situation, he says: ldquoMy dear friend Michael Russell, I have had to pull him up many times in discussions he has had here where he says the Scottish Parliament this and the Scottish Parliament that and he means the Scottish Government. They can conflate the two.ldquoThe Parliament is dferent from the Government and for us the institution develops, grows, matures. All of these additional powers and responsibilities it is taking on or will eventually take on, when the Scottish Government can get round to dealing with them, we need to see that dferentiation so people think the Parliament is dferent from the people who are running the Government.The Scottish Secretary admits that the Conservatives, who vehemently opposed devolution before the  referendum fearing a Yes vote could break up the Union, should have been quicker to accept the new settlement, which was voted for by nearly  per cent of Scotland on a  per cent turnout.He claims the Tories made a ldquoperfectly legitimate case in opposing devolution but ldquoonce it had become clear it was the settled will of the Scottish people, that it was going to happen, it would have been better to have accepted that earlier.Sir John Curtice: Devolution was supposed to kill nationalism stone dead - its very much aliveMr Mundell, who has held his Cabinet post since , goes on: ldquoI always pay tribute to David McLetchie[the late Scottish Conservative leader] because what he did was as a leader he took us into that Parliament and acted in a combative but a constructive way and the  Tory MSPs who were elected in  and all their successors have always embraced and worked for that Parliament and for devolution. Once the referendum decision had been made, they completely put behind their previous position.The -year-old MP for or Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale makes clear Holyrood has now established itself as part of Scottish le but its potential has been unfulfilled, not because of the Parliament itself but because of the governments since .ldquoThe initial Labour-Liberal Governments were dull they didnrsquot take any risks really in terms of what they did. The smoking ban was probably the biggest challenge to orthodoxy that took place and I commend the Parliament for that decision.ldquoSince [when the SNP took power] the constitution has ultimately dominated, he complains, claiming the Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon administrations have held back the development of Scottish devolution.ldquoEducation is the biggest indictment, declares Mr Mundell. ldquoIf,  years ago as we took our oath, people would have said after  years of this Parliament there would be more young people leaving school without any qualications at all, people would have been stunned.ldquoThey believed as I did that this Parliament was about enhancing and taking forward Scottish education and its traditions and its dferences and making it even better and that has not happened.ldquoI put a large part of that down to  years when the Scottish Parliament has spent focusing entirely on and such a big part of its emotional effort on the constitution. Itrsquos unfulfilled.When it is pointed out how the Tories bang on about the possibility of Scottish independence because the constitution is just as good electorally and politically for them as it is for the SNP, Mundell says: ldquoI can make a commitment right now thatNicola Sturgeon takes independence and another referendum off the table, Irsquoll stop speaking about it. I can give that absolute commitmenthellip Two weeks ago, the First Minister set out how there has to be another referendum, she wants to have a bill and Citizensrsquo Assemblies. I donrsquot want to have any of those things.But The Herald points out Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues would never take independence off the table and he knows it given the SNPrsquos raison drsquoetre is to campaign for an independent Scotland.He adds: ldquoThe SNPrsquos route to independence used to be they would deliver good government people will think we have done such a good job, we should be given the whole responsibility.

He used it to store sailing equipment and to launch his dinghy and also allowed local residents access to the facility.But he failed to apply for council planning permission and has now been told the isolated hut will have to come down before the end of the year. Mr Steven, of Tarbert, erected the remote unit three years ago after retiring to the area with his we.He told planners the boathouse was to be used as a launch pad for sailing his boat off the west coast of Scotland.He was told by Argyll and Bute Council the building was unauthorised but applied for retrospective planning permission.That was thrown out, but he took his fight to the Scottish Government, who have now sided with the council and ordered he knock it down.The council argued the timber building had a lsquosevere detrimentrsquo to the landscape, but Mr Steven insisted it was in such a remote location that it had no effect on the environment.He said: ldquoThe use of term ldquoto the severe detriment of the landscape quality again is subjective and seems designed to increase the negative aspects of the building.ldquoIt cannot be seen from any public areas, nor adjacent dwelling homes, nor the passing ferry traffic.ldquoIt requires further substantiation as to how it can be described as ldquosevere detriment.For example, we can understand the use of ldquosevere detrimentthe hut were placed in the middle of George Square in Glasgow or beside the castle on the top of the hill in Tarbert.ldquoIt seems inappropriate to apply such strong language in terms of this small hut and its modest, remote surroundings. It is a small hut, after all.Mr Steven added: ldquoWe really cannot see who or what is currently being harmed by the hut, we are open to any suggestions which would not result in the ultimate removal of this storage facility for all our boating paraphernalia and deprive the residents of Nether Auchans of a valued asset.ldquoNo one gains from its removal and at least five incoming families to the area would suffer.ldquoWe regret hugely the amount of time, effort and money on the part of ourselves, the council and the Scottish Government, this innocuous, innocent and relatively minor issue is causing. It is embarrassing.ldquoWe have made our lives here. From the degree of challenge and lack of pragmatism we have met, it is impossible to feel anything other than disappointed and unwelcome by an overly bureaucratic, inappropriate application of a process designed to protect our environment from infinitely greater threats than our storage shed.In a written ruling, government reporter Malcolm Mahony said: ldquoMr Steven explains that he built his present home at Nether Auchans primarily because the loch provided excellent summer mooring with a slipway for dinghy access.ldquoThe council argues that the building has the domestic character and appearance of ancillary residential structure, and would normally relate visually and ally to the curtilage of a residential dwelling house.ldquoHowever, it is beyond any residential curtilage and outwith the appellantrsquos ownership. It is inappropriate to, and visually incongruous within the sensitive, open and undeveloped landscape, and the isolated coastal location.ldquoMr Stevens has offered to further screen or adapt the building and its immediate area.

Gradually, the system clicked in and there was more process and procedure.Of course, Holyrood had to dferentiate itself from Westminster. ldquoWe tried to do everything dferently from the voting to the chamber everything had to be dferent.Mr Mundell says the new parliament was not like the Commons. ldquoThere was a greater camaraderie and affinity across members, particularly when everyone had arrived, it was new and it was a very exciting time. The hope and anticipation was tangible.But that did not last long as political enmity started to kick in.ldquoThe partisanship you see now, itrsquos very polarised now. At that period, we had a majority government, which no one ever anticipated and what you had as well, although you had a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, the Liberals had quite a lot of wild cards in that people like Donald Gorrie and John Farquhar Munroe, Labour had people like John MacAllion.

It has hardly been a seismic change, particularly given that % of UK children are educated by the state. But anything that takes account of the fact that three Bs from a socially disadvantaged child who cares for a sick parent might be worth the same as three As from a wealthy child whose parents invested in ongoing tuition has got to be a positive step on the road to social equality.Or so you would think. The problem is that some private-school parents, who have paid through the nose to ensure their child can tap into the type of privilege an Oxbridge education iniably brings, have cried foul, blaming social engineering on behalf of those further down the hierarchy of power for their own child missing out.There is a clear irony in the idea that social engineering could be working against any student educated at an Oxbridge feeder school, when school ties rather than academic achievement have often been enough to secure places in the past. Even the chair of the Independent Schools Council admitted as much when he noted that ldquoindependent schools report that their marginal candidates no longer tend to get into Cambridge but their good candidates are as successful as ever. Heaven forbid that those bright enough,not rich enough, might be successful too.Such attitudes are nothing new, with members of dominant groups regularly playing the discrimination card when they feel minorities are encroaching on their patch. Back in  Jonathan Sumption, then a Supreme Court judge who got his own break in law thanks to the intervention of a family friend, huffed that measures to improve the woeful lack of gender ersity in the judiciary ldquocould have appalling consequences for justice because they might ldquomake male candidates feel that the cards are stacked against them. Similarly, the BBC faced accusations of discriminating against whites when, in , it sought to make its newsroom more representative of the population it serves by making a traineeship open to black, Asian or non-white ethnic minority applicants only.While those making such arguments say they fear that bright-enough rich kids and talented-enough white men will lose out to less-bright poor kids or less-talented minorities, what they really fear is that long-established power imbalances may be tipping out of their favour. For them, the prospect of equality is a scary one.It neednrsquot be. Just as no privately educated student smart enough to study at Oxbridge has anything to fear from a state-educated pupil who is smart enough too, no man cut out for high office needs be afraid of missing out to a woman who has also got what it takes. Thatrsquos the beauty of equality: it would make room for everyone deserving of a place.The problem with the knee-jerk reactions of those who fear losing out, those who cry discrimination from their established positions of power, is that it can have very real consequences for those who are already being discriminated against because the balance of power remains so unequal.Take Glasgow. Last week the city councilrsquos licensing committee threw out an application for a female-only taxi business on the basis that it would discriminate against men. Though the vast majority of taxis in the city are driven by men, a reality that some women find intimidatory, the council baulked at the idea of female passengers being able to choose only female drivers and female drivers being matched only with female fares.Committee convenor Alex Wilson, the SNP member for Cardonald, opposed the plan on the basis that ldquothe whole not picking up male passengers is a concern to me while, in a rare show of unity across the political ide, Conservative member Robert Connolly said the idea of a service run by women for women ldquois essentially sexism towards males.Their words shame them. Sexism, just like any other form of discrimination, works because one party - men - has more power than another - women. Some men choose to wield that power through sex attacks and violence, and it is not discriminatory for women to want to protect themselves from that.Sure it would be a pain for a man to have to wait a few minutes to catch a ride home, just like it would be galling for an Oxford-bound student to have to settle for Bristol University instead. But unless and until we live in a world where all things are equal, theyrsquore really not in a position to complain."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-extremist-brexit-party-is-not-the-voice-of-leave-voters","story":" No Deal was overwhelmingly defeated in Parliament.

The only connection with Scotland seems to be the word \"Scotland\" printed on the front.Scotland was split down the middle in the independence referendum, voting  , a result likely to be replicated should Nicola Sturgeon be foolish enough to try again. But in other ways, Scotland is not ided. Scotland supports having its own parliament. Scotland wants to stay in the EU.What Scotland does not like is interlopers who try to take advantage. The latest in the long line of people who think Scots are daft and can be taken for a ride is the Brexit Party. Its election document shows three candidates, one from London, one from Lowestoft, the other from Sussex. Two other candidates are a property developer and a CEO of a property company.The Brexit party is masquerading as a party for the common man, whereas it is nothing of the sort. It is a right-wing party stuffed full of disaffected Tories. The last time Nigel Farage came to Edinburgh, he had to be rescued by the police. Time to send this banker packing, back to the City of London, without the votes he needs to keep on the gravy train.Phil Tate,Edinburgh.ANDREW Marr was quite right to question Nigel Farage about the policies a Farage-led or influenced government would adopt and to quote previous comments on issues such as immigration, NHS and smaller government. After all, he claims the EU election would herald the end of two-party government so these questions are hardly irrelevant.Sadly, Marrs robust and persistent line only seems to be reserved for certain iniduals or parties and not the likes of Nicola Sturgeon, who iniably gets off with an approach only a few notches above asking what her favourite colour is.

Yet the composition of our parliament is much more reflective of the votes cast, than Westminster is. The SNPis the most popular Scottish party with the public. It is a centrist, social democrat party, yet cannot find a partner for a coalition among the others. It is surely ironic that the Big Two are now both ldquoseparatist when it comes to one union, yet refuse to form any partnership with the SNP because of its ldquoseparatism toward another union. The Scottish LibDems  I honestly have no idea what role they wish to play in Scotland, other than costing the public a fortune in Freedom of Information requests.But we should have concerns over the distancing of the elected from the electorate.

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations. It will feature many of the ordinary people who have had an impact on the Parliament during its -year history. Ken said: “We are always trying to find new ways of engaging with the public and, in many ways, that’s what the exhibition and the th anniversary is all about.”The community and engagement unit is also trying to track down the babies who were born on July , .The youngsters share their birthday with the Parliament and were a big part of the th anniversary. The hope is that they can all be reunited on Saturday, June , for the th birthday party.For more information on events, visit www.parliament.scot.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Transport Scotland will evaluate bids received, with a view to having a new public service contract in place by  October .#Mr Wheelhouse added: #Simultaneously, Transport Scotland will continue its engagement with the European Commission to seek an early resolution to Pentland Ferries’ outstanding State aid complaint about the subsidies payable under the next public services contract.#Further information about Transport Scotland’s engagement with the Commission and any implications for the tender procedure will be announced in due course.#Responding to confirmation by the Scottish Government that the tendering of the Northern Isles ferry contract will proceed as set out in the original documentation, Orkney’s MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is welcome confirmation by the Minister that there should be no slippage in the timing for tendering the next Northern Isles ferry contract. However, the timeframe is tight and will be challenging for both bidders.“We need to see real improvements delivered through the next contract, including an increase in freight capacity and restoration of sailings on the Pentland Firth route.“Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to shed any light on when passengers on the Northern Isles routes can expect to benefit from RET.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

Having studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris, I was consistently struck by the long-lasting and little-known links that unite us: the Auld Alliance is not merely a gimmick beloved of rugby fans, it has united our peoples more deeply than we acknowledge today. Thousands of French people in the Berry and Anjou regions are descendants of Scots who settled there after fighting to help France regain its independence with Charles VII. When my grandfather was born, any French or Scottish citizen could still automatically obtain dual nationality!Were France to turn her back on this friendship forged with Scotland over the centuries, she would be neglecting her own history. We cannot build anything unless we enhance the coherence and strong links we have with our past. What’s more, French politicians cannot remain indferent to the burning question of your national destiny, one that has been asked for several years. Nicola Sturgeon has announced that legislation to organise a new referendum on Scotland’s independence by  will be presented shortly. At this time, Europe and France must speak with one voice on the European future of Scotland. This issue is fundamental. The result of the  independence referendum was influenced by this European aspect, given that by leaving the UK, Scotland may also have been obliged to leave the EU. In the end, because of the demagogues that pushed for Brexit, Scotland will most likely be unable to stay in the EU anyway!Deeply attached to the project of European construction, the Scots are being pushed towards the exit against their will. Such a situation deserves better than a closed door. The European Commission led by José Manuel Barroso made a big mistake in  when it explicitly closed the door to a deeply pro-European people, who have been fully-fledged members of the Community for the past  years. In stating that Scotland would have no place in Europe, it did not live up to its role, which had obvious repercussions on the result of the vote, undermining the project of an independent Scotland. Former French President François Hollande did not offer a helping hand in , committing an enormous error when he deemed that the issue of Scottish independence was merely one of British domestic politics. That is not true - the destiny of the Scottish people is a deeply European issue! France has no vocation to support or to oppose the will of the Scottish people to become an independent state, since this question is to be answered by those living in Scotland. However, France’s role is to state very clearly that in the event of independence, Scotland would have its place in the European Union, and should not be deprived of its European destiny. I called on the French President to express this position very clearly on the future of Scotland and Europe. Emmanuel Macron must not follow in his predecessor’s footsteps: the silence of European leaders on Scotland’s future does a disservice to the European ideal. How can Europe be revivedwe refuse to open our arms to one of our continent’s most pro-European peoples  Europe’s legitimacy is strengthened when it helps us do better what we cannot do alone, whether that means fighting climate change, creating a balance of power with China, or leading the US in terms of articial intelligence. To achieve this, we need the Scots who understood that Europe was not just a huge single market, but a powerful tool for our peoples. I deeply believe that an independent Scotland would have its place in Europe with no conditions and without delay, something of which it cannot be deprived. The deadlines and conditions imposed during the joining process are dependent on candidate states complying with EU treaties and regulations known as “acquis communautaires”. In this case, an independent Scotland would become one of the most developed states in the EU, having complied with the “acquis” for several decades. Now that the Spanish veto has been lted, nothing would prevent Scotland’s integration by way of an exceptional procedure, similar to the one used by the EEC when it integrated the German Democratic Republic in . The signicant choice you have to make by  belongs to you. With this in mind, remember that across the Channel, you can count on friends who have not forgotten that the Scots are a great European people, and that Scotland is a friend and a historical ally of France.Jean-Christophe Lagarde is a French MP and head of UDI party and Les Européens campaign©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch too late to stop brexit party bandwagon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Dead policies walking. Dead excuses on parade. Watching UK Education Secretary Damian Hinds on the Andrew Marr programme yesterday, I was reminded of Iain Duncan Smith#s #quiet man# routine # that last embarrassing attempt to postpone his inevitable removal as Tory leader. This time of course it won#t just be a politician but an entire party that fails. And the sure signs are wooden TV performances, where answers to straight questions sound like something from a Monty Python sketch.Will there be a Tory campaign launch for the European elections  No, we don’t think that’s necessary. Will there be a manesto  Well, we have lots of policies, I can explain themyou like.Within the context of the Brexit quagmire, this may seem unremarkable. But there are basic conventions about elections and one is that political parties publish manestos so voters know what they’re voting for. I can’t think of another election in which the governing party has failed to comply with this most fundamental part of the pact between politicians and voters. The most astonishing thing is that Theresa May thinks she’s got away with it, like a child hiding behind a book who thinks the rest of the world has disappeared. But politics doesn’t work that way, as the Conservatives are about to discover, courtesy of Nigel Farage.The latest opinion polls suggest the Brexit Party is set to win the forthcoming Euro elections and could potentially become the largest party at any subsequent Westminster poll.  per cent of Tory members say they’ll back Farage along with  per cent of Tory councillors. Asked how she’d be voting by Radio  Live, Brexiteer Tory MP Maria Caulfield answered “I don’t know.” But actually, this is no dferent to the last European elections in  when Nigel Farage unleashed his much-promised political earthquake. Ukip stormed to victory with  per cent of the vote and  MEPs, precipitating David Cameron’s promise of an EU referendum in the Tories’  manesto. That general election saw Ukip come third in terms of the popular vote, but ended up with just one MP thanks to Westminster’s broken first-past-the-post system. The Tories’ .m votes produced  seats – Ukip’s .m votes produced just one seat. The Greens were similarly cheated. Evenyou oppose Ukip’s politics, go figure how that can be called democracy.Farage’s opponents heaved a sigh of relief. It might not have been the ideal way to defeat him, but any port in a storm. How wrong they were. Voters may not have been storming the barricades demanding PR and the unelected House of Lords unaccountably produces less voter ire than the unelected European Commission – but let’s not misread the signs. Like referred pain in the human body, the hurt of Brexit relates to dys where in the body politic. Broken British democracy is the problem and it feeds the Ukip Brexit insurgency. Not being elected has actually suited Farage. It has let him play the martyr, evade political scrutiny during his fraudulent Brexit campaign, then slip away when the going got rough. Because his real, popular support was unacknowledged by British democracy, Farage was able to guilt-trip and browbeat broadcasters, becoming a near constant presence on opinion-forming news outlets. Above all, the unelectable Farage needed no manesto. He just made it up as he went along. And now the Tory party, the government of this country, is playing the same low game.Is it too late to stop the Brexit Party bandwagon  Yes, it is.Farage ran amok on Question Time last week, speaking over every contributor and leaving the programme unwatchable for all but his supporters. Aunty retrieved itself somewhat yesterday when Andrew Marr gamely challenged Farage on his oft-overlooked far right policy stances which include replacing the NHS with a system of private health insurance. But that will hardly dent his support. Ukip has moved so far to the racist right that Farage looks almost respectable, and having Boris – the “lovable face of far right-wing lunacy” - as Tory leadership contender doesn’t hurt either. For voters who believe Brexit is the panacea for all Britain’s ills, there’s still only one game in town.But the newness of his latest party vehicle shouldn’t disguise the fact Farage is still the old Farage. The added potency of the Brexit Party this time round derives from one simple fact. In the five years since his party won European elections but got no formal role within British politics, absolutely nothing has changed. The Tories still haven’t made their minds up about Brexit, neither has Labour. Britain is still the most centralised top-down society in Europe and in a quarter of seats it still doesn’t matteryou turn out and vote or not. From the Scottish perspective, the only change since  is Holyrood’s imminent loss of devolved powers.So, Farage is tactically right to bang on about democracy at every turn. Of course, he wouldn’t know itdemocracy smacked him in the face and he doesn’t specy solutions beyond Brexit lest he accidentally refocus English voters on the real, immediate dangers of their own ailing, archaic system. But he’s absolutely on the money. It’s democracy, stupid - precisely because the main UK parties will not modernise the British state. The final straw is the Tory decision to flout electoral convention and pretend the European poll isn’t even happening. Nigel is not the only insurgent newkid on the block. The Lib Dems made a recovery at the local elections and, the Greens also did well. Indeed, all the parties with a clear vision of the future have picked up support. In Scotland, where the SNP has unequivocally nailed its colours to the European mast, it’ll be interesting to seethe recent declaration of a climate emergency by Nicola Sturgeon helps her or the Scottish Greens. The surprising decision by the hitherto Labour-supporting Sunday Mail to back Patrick Harvie’s party may be early evidence of a profound realignment, though some Yes supporters think it’s just a ruse to split the independence vote. The awkward truth could be that voters are more impatient for change than governing parties north and south of the border.What a dference a month makes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon snp remains focused on indyref2","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP remains focused on delivering a second independence referendum as the party steps up its campaign ahead of next week#s European elections.Speaking to the media this morning, the first minister said that a strong performance from the Nationalists at the May  poll would send “the strongest possible message that Scotland does not want Brexit”.The SNP leader added that legislation would be brought forward later this month as part of the intitial steps required to stage a possible IndyRef.But the Scottish Conservatives said it was time to deliver a “sensible Brexit”.Ms Sturgeon told MSPs last month that she wanted to stage a second referendum by Brexit takes place.: Sturgeon offers support to SNP MP at centre of bullying claim“My focus as SNP leader is firstly on winning the European elections next week because that’s how we send the strongest possible message that Scotland doesn’t want Brexit,” the first minister said in an interview today.“Then of course the legislation we’ll bring forward later this month in taking the steps to give people in Scotland a choice of independence later in this term of parliament. That’s my focus as SNP leader and that’s what the party is focused on.”Current polling suggests the SNP is on course to better its performance at the last European elections in , when it ed two of Scotland’s six MEPs.The Nationalist leader has previously called for Labour voters to back her party over Jeremy Corbyn’s “confused” stance on Brexit.Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: “Nicola Sturgeon has made clear today that, as she puts it, ‘her focus’ at these elections is a second independence referendum.“Once again we see the reality: it doesn’t matter what the election is– Nicola Sturgeon’s priority is always to try and use it to push through the one thing she cares about – independence.“Only by voting Scottish Conservative and Unionist on May rd can people send her a message - no to any more referendums.“It’s time to respect the results of the referendums we have held, deliver a sensible Brexit and then let Scotland and the whole UK move on.”European elections are held every five years, with the UK electing  MEPs to sit in the -member Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"rift over fresh referendum leaves brexit talks running out of road","story":"Cross-party Brexit talks were believed to be close to collapse last night after Downing Street firmly rejected demands for any compromise deal to include a referendum that could keep the UK in the EU.Senior figures from both parties met again last night, but the gulf between them appears to be growing with Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer warning that an agreement was “impossible” without a “confirmatory vote”.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said Theresa May was “focused on delivering the result of the first referendum”.Reports that Tory MPs have been placed on a three-line whip later this week raised speculation that the government could make a final attempt to hold votes on a Brexit outcome before European elections on  May.Mrs May’s spokesman said the government was prepared to hold ‘definitive votes’ once Labour’s support is secured.“If we were able to make progress with Labour then we would look to bring the bill before the House of Commons before the European elections,” he said.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said this week would be “crunch week”, adding that another public vote “would be a betrayal of what people voted for, and we want to implement the first referendum”.Today’s Cabinet meeting will consider the state of cross-party talks. “There will be a substantive Cabinet discussion on wherever we have got to,” a senior government source said.But Mr Starmer suggested a deal was beyond reach, warning that “probably not ” of the party’s  MPs could vote against it unless it was linked to a second referendum.“I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote,” he said.And Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said he thought the way out of the impasse was a “confirmatory ballot” on Theresa May’s agreement, saying it would be “dficult” for his party to assist in the UK’s exit from the EU without another referendum.Mr Watson told the BBC: “If a deal could be found that inspires enough votes in Westminster then fine, but it seemed to me that that’s very, very dficult.“And so my idea of a confirmatory ballot is not a religious point or a point of ideology, it’s just how do you get an outcome, how do you sort this out “And one way to do it are these two minority positions - the Prime Minister’s deal and those that think the people should have a say on the deal - plug them together and you build a majority.”Mr Watson also insisted Labour was a “remain and reform” party, in defiance of several of Jeremy Corbyn’s allies who have called for the opposition to respect the Brexit referendum result.Targeting Labour voters on a European election campaign stop in Yorkshire, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage claimed a new referendum would help him win a majority in Parliament at the next general election.Speaking in Pontefract, part of Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s constituency, Mr Farage said: “A confirmatory vote, it sounds all nice and fluffy, what does it mean  It means we stay in the European Union as we are, or we nominally leave and stay permanently part of a customs union and with single market rules.“They wouldn’t even give the public the option of actually leaving.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing.

After a warm welcome at reception wemade our way to our Executive room on the hotel’s first floor. The room was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom – a welcome slate of fresh fruit and bouquet of flowers was a wonderful touch.Over a cup of tea we were able to see more guests arrive throughout the afternoon who were accessing the hotel’s popular apartments and it was a quick change before heading out for dinner at Malone Lodge’s Kne and Fork Grill and Deli. The hotel’s restaurant is beautully laid-out with burgundy leather banquettes and ornate glass cases containing antique cutlery. Our sitting was for .pm and already there was a buzz in the restaurant with both couples and families celebrating birthdays and other special occasions. Once settled we had a look over Malone Lodge’s All Day Menu, which is served both in the main restaurant and Macklin’s lounge. Light bites included soup of the day, classic Caesar salad, chicken wings and beetroot and goat’s cheese salad. My partner and I decided to start things off with two servings of the goat’s cheese, which was delicious – pearls of tangy goat’s cheese were perfectly dressed accompanied by a scattering of caramelised walnuts and leaves.We surveyed a mouth-watering menu but it was a dish of chicken and chorizo carbonara served with a wedge of garlic bread and rocket that won out, along with a fillet of salmon with cockles, carrots, celery and lemon persillade sauce. My salmon main was a plump fillet with crispy skin sat atop a mound of creamy mash, green beans, roasted parsnip and caullower. Across the table the pasta was hailed a success. Generous side portions of onion rings and sweet potato fries ensured we had no room for dessert, tea or coffee but opted for a drink in the lounge where we promptly sank into one of their luxurious Queen-sized armchairs and did something we hadn’t done in a while – relax.The hotel staff in Malone Lodge are at the top of their game when it comes to going above and beyond to ensure your stay is a memorable one. This was further demonstrated at a very busy breakfast service the next morning. Nothing was too much trouble as we were guided to bowls of fresh fruit, granola, juices and toast with the option on offer to opt for something cooked to order. Full Irish, porridge, scrambled eggs and homemade pancakes are there for the taking, but we opted for the muffin, bacon and avocado combination, which hit the spot along with pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea.Malone Lodge Hotel offers a first class experience from the minute you step into their reception, until, sadly, in our case, you check out and back to reality.The hotel is within walking distance of Queen’s University, Botanic Gardens and a host of other South Belfast attractions. We particularly enjoyed the café culture of the surrounding area. The hotel boasts its own private car park which is becoming something of a rarity these days and it’s a mre step out of the vehicle and in to the hotel.Malone Lodge offers the perfect stay to all and, for us, on this occasion, a memorable one.For more information visit Malone Lodge Hotel and Apartments at www.malonelodgebelfast or Tel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"carry your passport says man quizzed on belfast to dublin bus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

in the cross-party talks agreed that no Parliament can bind a future government and pointed out that most EU trade deals have a six- month exit clause.Meanwhile, Mrs May’s chief negotiator Olly

customs union-based deal with Labour will very likely lose the support of Conservative MPs, like us, who backed the Withdrawal Agreement in March… and you would be unlikely to gain as many Labour MPs to compensate,” they wrote, according to The Times.“More fundamentally, you would have lost the loyal middle of the Conservative Party, split our party and with likely nothing to show for it.”Their

Monday of the Parliamentary Labour Party, pro-Remain MP Peter Kyle told the Labour leader their message on a second referendum had been too complicated and had left voters perplexed.“I urge you to simply our policy so people realise we are speaking with absolute sincerity,” he told Mr Corbyn.Pro-Brexit MP John Mann called on Mr Corbyn to give Labour MPs a free vote on Brexit issues to reflect the isions within the party and the country.“Labour voters are ided in a very big way,” he told him.“If you don’t get this right you cannot be prime minister.”Mr Corbyn acknowledged the MPs’ “frustrations” and said he understood the need to simply their message, telling them: “I get that.”A Labour source said: “Our message is about bringing the country together.“That means people who voted Leave and people who voted for Remain.”Earlier, Sir Keir and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson threw their weight behind calls for any Brexit deal to be put to a second referendum – something Mr

between the Conservatives and Labour could clear the Commons unless it guaranteed the deal would be put back to the public for a “confirmatory vote”.Sir Keir made the comments ahead of crunch talks between Cabinet ministers and senior Labour figures on Monday, although speculation was growing over whether the negotiations will succeed.Speaking to , the leading Labour negotiator said his colleagues and the party leadership would have to decide “in the coming days”it was worth continuing with the talks.I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory voteSir Keir StarmerMeanwhile, The Times reported that the Prime Minister has been urged by Cabinet ministers to pull out of the talks and move to indicative votes by MPs.Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to be among those who have lost faith with the plan to strike a cross-party deal, while on Sunday Education Secretary Damian Hinds expressed support for finding a “stable majority” by allowing MPs to vote on dferent options.In the wake of dire local election results for the Tories and Labour and looming European elections – which could see Nigel Farage’s newcomer Brexit Party make unprecedented gains – both parties are under pressure to make progress on Britain’s EU departure.“I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote,” Sir Keir said.The shadow minister said that “probably not ” of the party’s  MPs could vote against the deal unless it was linked to a second referendum.“If the point of the exercise is to get a sustainable majority, over several weeks or months of delivering on the implementation, you can’t leave a confirmatory vote out of the package,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May is under pressure to make progress on Brexit Sir Keir signalled that Labour expects movement from the Government this week in order to keep the talks on track, telling the paper it “would be wrong in principle to use up much more time simply exploring each other’s positions”.“I do think we do probably in the coming days need to make that assessment.”The issue of a confirmatory referendum has been an internal battleground within Labour ranks, with Sir Keir pushing for one but shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, also part of the negotiating team, less keen.Sir Keir highlighted how the party lost  lost seats in this month’s council elections, which he said were a sign Labour was losing the trust of Remain as well as Leave voters.The party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is expected to call for a second vote in a speech on Monday.Mr Watson will reportedly invoke the late Labour leader John Smith, saying the heavyweight would have backed a “people’s vote as a way out of this destructive mess”.The Sun says Mr Watson will tell the Fabian Society that Mr Smith, who was tipped to become prime minister before his death  years ago, saw “anti-EU sentiment” as “wrong-headed”.The BBC reported that Mr Watson will “plead” with voters to back Labour in next week’s European Parliament elections, despite the party’s Brexit stance.“There are only two forces that can win this election – that nasty nationalism of the Farage Brexit Party, or the tolerant, compassionate outward-looking patriotism of the Labour Party,” he will say.I think well get an absolute maulingHuw Merriman, Conservative politicianA ComRes general election poll published on the weekend found Mr Farage’s Brexit Party had overtaken the Tories for the first time, taking a one-point lead.That level of support would see the Brexit Party win  seats, becoming the UK’s second biggest party after Labour, with .Speaking to the BBC Radio  Westminster Hour on Sunday night, the Chancellor’s parliamentary aide, Huw Merriman, said the Tories will suffer “an absolute mauling” in next week’s European Parliament elections.“The public will blame the Conservative government because we were the party that brought forward the referendum,” said Mr Merriman, who backs a second referendum.“And so for those that didn’t want it and wanted Remain, they’ll blame us for having tried to take us out.“And for those that voted to leave, they’ll blame us for having not got the country out of the EU.“We’re at the perfect storm, so yes, I think we’ll get an absolute mauling.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bullied spurs fan cheered on by hundreds as she recreates nowfamous dance

Kechiche has denied it.The decision to give Alain Delon, the -year-old French acting legend of Le Samourai and The Leopard, an honorary Palme d’Or prompted an online petition against it.Deon has acknowledged slapping women in the past and said he opposes the adoption of children by same-sex parents.Fremaux said Delon comes from another generation and that he’s free to express his views, whatever they are.“We’re not giving Alain Delon the Nobel Peace Prize,” said Fremaux."},{"url":null,"title":"british government cannot allowed hide role conflict mccartney","story":"The British government is \"clearly still intent\" on covering up its role in the conflict after Britains information watchdog ruled that a report calling for the shakeup of the RUC would remain secret more than  years after it was written, Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney said.

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

Unfortunately it hasn’t been respected. We have a remain parliament. Therefore, parliament has not been able to deliver on Brexit in the way that it should have been delivered upon.“We have a prime minister, frankly, who doesn’t have the vision for the United Kingdom post-Brexit that we all want to see. We want to see a United Kingdom that is strong post-Brexit, that has a strong relationship with Europe ... but we have to deliver on the wishes of the people.“I mean, democracy is at risk herewe do not respect the wishes of the people in the referendum and that’s why we believe we should defend the Union and deliver on Brexit.”DUP MEP Diane Dodds also implicitly looked beyond Mrs May, saying that Brexit should be delivered “whoever the prime minister happens to be”.Speaking at the manesto launch in Seaview football stadium in north Belfast, Mrs Foster stressed her desire to see unionists transfer from the DUP to other pro-Union candidates. Although that is in line with past DUP policy, that message is prominently reinforced on the cover of DUP election literature, an allusionto the concern that with UUP veteran Jim Nicholson not standing again and a falling unionist vote, unionism might not hold its two MEP seats.When asked which two unionists she wanted to see ed, Mrs Foster declined to give a clear answer, saying: “Well, obviously I want to see Diane Dodds ed first ... and then it is for the electorate to decide in terms of the other unionist that is ed. We want to send a very clear message to defend the Union and to deliver on Brexit ... the first priority is always to defend the Union. We are a unionist party – the clue is in the title – so we want to see two unionists ed.”When asked why unionists should not vote tactically for Jim Allister or Danny Kennedy in an attempt to secure two unionist seats, Mrs Dodds said: “It is incredibly important for us that you vote Dodds number one because we want to send a message to London and Brussels that the will of the people cannot be overturned, that the referendum result must be respected – and with due respect to all the other parties in the election, it is only the DUP that has the strength to actually deliver on that.” She added: “This is about sending a huge big message to London and to Brussels that we want to leave the European Union and we want to leave together.”With the possibility that the MEPs elected next week will not serve more than a few months in their posts, yesterday’s manesto launch focused largely on the principle of leaving the EU rather than what Mrs Dodds will dothat does not happen.However, the manesto sets out her decade of experience as an MEP, describing her as a “champion for the interests of Northern Ireland”.

The manesto also sets out her support for an EU-wide end to cross-border mobile phone roaming charges, a particular problem for those living in border counties.With Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not standing in Northern Ireland, the DUP has set out a manesto which presents the party as the most firmly pro-Brexit major party in the contest.The DUP, which led the campaign for a leave vote in Northern Ireland during the  referendum, is fighting the election under the slogan ‘Defend the Union Deliver Brexit’.Writing in the party’s manesto, Arlene Foster said of the  referendum: “It was not an English vote, a Scottish vote, a Welsh vote or a Northern Irish vote but a British vote to leave. It is often forgotten that it was the ‘Leave’ vote in Scotland and Northern Ireland that gave the Leave campaign its UK majority.”She added: “I recognise that within unionism there was a ergence between Leave and Remain. However, our common unionism means we can all unite in respecting the result and that we should leave as one United kingdom.”Mrs Dodds’ election literature reinforces the DUP’s opposition to the backstop in Theresa May’s proposed deal with the EU, something it says would threaten the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK and mean that Northern Ireland “would sit in a separate legal position from the rest of the United Kingdom in economic and trade terms”.The candidate said: “We believed the result of the referendum in  must be honoured.

Young people from across Northern Ireland will also join the audience at the UU’s Belfast campus.The report launch comes amid renewed efforts at Stormont to restore the power-sharing institutions after more than two years without a ing government.Professor Morrow said the recent murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry should focus minds on the need to act.“The deeply tragic events of recent weeks sharpen the focus on just how dangerously close we remain to this residual threat,” he said.Arlene Foster rounds on Theresa May over lack of vision for post-Brexit UK Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The young people taking part reflect the hope and optimism that we all hold for Northern Ireland, but we have a duty of care and leadership to ensure that the expectation, aspiration and potential of the next and future generations is met and not stled by sectarian polarisation. We hope that the review’s recommendations will make possible the step change needed.”The Sir George Quigley Fund was set up by the Ulster Bank in honour of its former chairman. The leading civil servant and businessman was a strong advocate of initiatives to tackle sectarianism.Ronnie Kells, chair of the Quigley Fund committee, said: “We acknowledge the extremely positive contribution made over the years by many iniduals and organisations to address sectarianism, often working silently and unrecognised.“Regrettably, sectarianism still lingers at the heart of our society and acts as a barrier to prosperity and as an insult to a civilised community. This scourge of several generations will persist unless resolute and sustained action is taken to address it.“Everyone has a role to play in addressing this problem – it is not the sole responsibility of government or the political parties in Northern Ireland. “Civic society needs to work with them to ensure it is placed at the top of the public agenda alongside the economy as a key priority. We trust that our conference will help to establish the foundations for a credible solution driven by collegiate and concerted civic leadership and action.”try catch  TrendingFirefighter who died in NI motorbike crash named locallySunday Times Rich List : These are the  richest people in Northern IrelandMichael Dunlop wrist injury could jeopardise prospects at North West  and Isle of Man TTOne person rushed to hospital after pedestrian and lorry incident -

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

years in the business  ","story":"Edward Wilson CBE, Chairman of Ulster Carpets, has retired after over half a century at the leading luxury carpet manufacturer. Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
