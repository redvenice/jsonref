It is a basic existence. We work all the hours that God sends because we have to.\u0027We do not understand things about saving the planet or what is or is not organic. For us it is all about work and survival.\u0027         Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong KongMrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176).The couple start work at 9.30am and finish at 5.30pm, six days per week. They are only given 25 minutes for lunch and are not provided with any formal contracts.Their salaries may seem low by western standards but in Mr Gopal\u0027s case, he earns above the national average monthly salary of 13,000 rupees (£154). His wife however falls below this threshold meaning their combined income is barely enough for a family of eight. Neither of their sons are in full-time employment and have just started their own hand printing business from home. The family survives on a mainly vegetarian diet of rice, lentils and vegetables, which have increased in price in recent times. A kilo of lentils, for example, can cost anything up to 200 rupees (£2.37) while most vegetables are less than half that. The average price of a bottle of beer is also 200 rupees.Mr Gopal, aged 55, said: \u0027Even though by Indian standards my salary is just above average as a family, if you combine our income, we are poor and things are very hard. We do not know about the world of the rich and famous who buy the things we make. We do not even know which countries it is being sent to. \u0027My job is very demanding and requires a lot of skill but it is not very well paid. Sadly, it is all I know, this is the only thing that I\u0027ve done all my life.\u0027When shown a picture of Meghan holding baby Archie in the blanket he helped make, Mr Gopal beamed with pride. He added: \u0027I do not know who these people are but we had heard that somebody very famous was using our dohar. This must be them.

She shares it with her husband, two sons, their wives and two grandchildren. They live in two rooms, which are poorly lit due to intermittent electricity while there is also a limited water supply.

As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176)         Mrs Regar, a seamstress, helping add finishing touches to what they have dubbed \u0027the Royal blanket\u0027 produced pay slips showing she earns an average of 6,000 rupees per month (above)\u0027Perhaps they might want to come and visit me one day to see how I made it? I might be poor but I feel very proud that royal people are using this blanket.\u0027When MailOnline visited the Nayika factory, workers were busy hand block printing reams of organic cotton which form the outer layers of the dohar. These are then stuffed with mulmul, fine, soft cotton and then stitched to complete the blanket. Since Meghan appeared in public with Archie wrapped in it, orders have gone through the roof and around 2,000 are currently being made to meet demand. The hand-crafted blanket has sold out on the Malabar Baby website and is available for pre-order only. It is described as being \u0027simple but chic,\u0027 and makes \u0027cuddle time lots of fun at home or on the go.\u0027Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry. Workers are paid a fixed monthly salary, as opposed to each item they make, child labour is strictly forbidden and there is a high level of cleanliness. While concerns have been raised over salaries, employees describe the management as \u0027fair.\u0027         Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry.

We make all the Malabar Baby range and ensure that this is done to a very high standard.\u0027We were very shocked to learn of the royal approval for our product. We told all the workers about it but I don\u0027t think they really understood the significance of this. But we are delighted that the Royal family of Great Britain are using something that we have made. It is a true honour.\u0027When asked about the meagre wages of some of the workers, Mr Mohammed replied: \u0027These are industry standard rates. We do not set them.\u0027Our workers enjoy good conditions, much better than you\u0027ll find at other factories. We pay them the correct rate and treat them well.\u0027Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American businesswoman Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong Kong. She came up with the idea after being unable to find baby wear and accessories that she felt were affordable and of high quality.She named the company after the exclusive area of Mumbai where he family lives.During a visit to the Nayika factor earlier this year, Anjali posted a photograph of herself with Mrs Regar on social media to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day but incorrectly called her Anita.  A spokeswoman for the company told MailOnline: \u0027Malabar Baby is a small, family run business that prides itself on producing high quality products which are slow made in small batches. \u0027The dohar blanket takes between 5 - 7 days to make and requires the work of highly skilled block printers to produce. The founder is passionate about encouraging people to buy less and buy better quality, but offering products at an accessible price point so they can be enjoyed by all,\u0027 they added. "},{"url":null,"title":"Jack Grealish Connor Wickham separate bust ups revellers exclusive London club","story":"Share this article          It is not known what started the altercation but police confirmed they did not attend the scene         In the photographs, Grealish can be seen remonstrating at someone while other revellers look onA witness said he saw the Crystal Palace striker leave the club when another reveller said something to him \u0027out of the blue\u0027 which kicked off the scrap.Both players had been involved in pre-season matches on Saturday with Wickham scoring past Bristol City and Grealish assisting two against Charlton Athletic. It is not the first time that Jack Grealish has come under the spotlight for his off-the-field antics.The talented star, who has often been linked with big-money moves to top clubs, was pictured passed out drunk in Tenerife in 2015.

The money lost on the annex meant she had to be put in a care home.                The Elmhurst family paid £43,200 for Hudson Garden Rooms to build this annex for their mother Carolyn to live in. They have since gone bust and left them £37,500 out of pocket            Holly Elmhurst, 49 (left) enlisted Hudson Garden Rooms to build a four-room annex in her sister Samantha\u0027s (right) garden for her mother Carolyn Lerski, 76 (pictured) to live inMs Elmhurst, who claims surveyors have told her fixing the build will cost a further £37,500, said: \u0027They said they could build exactly what my mother wanted, and have the work done in three months.\u0027But they didn\u0027t put proper drains in, the guttering just hangs over the garden, the floor wasn\u0027t finished, the ceiling is damp on it.\u0027We had to pay someone else to fit some decking so my mum could walk inside the property.\u0027The property is unlivable, and now mum has had to live in a care home.\u0027Ms Elmhurst\u0027s sister Samantha, 51, has also been fighting to have the problem resolved.She said: \u0027The company director has never set foot in this place since the first day and didn\u0027t even check what his workers had done.\u0027My mum had a brain aneurysm in 2016 whilst build was happening, which led to dementia and her being bound to a wheelchair.\u0027           Building work on the garden annex (pictured) stopped after three months and they later found the company had gone bust            Inside the garden lodge the ceilings were damp, lighting fittings not attached properly and door frames wonky Single mother-of-two Carolyn moved out of her previous rented accommodation in Norwich so she could be closer to her family but thought the annex was the perfect solution to maintain some independence.Holly claims she and her family began to notice problems with the build soon after it work started, with construction halting completely in July 2016.They claim the outbuilding has no ventilation system, foul water drainage, partly un-insulated floors, doors and windows that do not meet fire safety rules, damp staining on the ceiling after an un-insulated water pipe froze and burst and water pipes which were installed halfway up the side of the house rather than being buried.They were forced to spend thousands on legal fees and claim surveyors told them it will cost a further £37,500 to repair the errors.            Damp marks soon appeared on the ceiling of the four-room annex in Norwich            Work was unfinished on the kitchen (pictured) leaving the family battling a court case But they also insist they can\u0027t get any money back now the company has gone bust.  Samantha said: \u0027The company liquidated itself despite owing £400,000 to creditors - this information can be found on Companies House.\u0027It\u0027s awful they\u0027re still able to do this. The way all of us have been treated has been dreadful.\u0027The unacceptable and ugly soil and water pipes that Hudsons \u0027draped\u0027 around our patio area are a constant reminder of their shoddy work.\u0027When you think about what has happened too much, it\u0027s just awful.\u0027Holly has since set up a JustGiving account to try and recuperate her mum\u0027s lost money and pay for alternative retirement care.            Since the botched building job Mrs Lerski has had a brain aneurysm and been diagnosed with dementia            The money lost on the annex (pictured) meant she (pictured in a wheelchair with daughters Holly and Samantha) had to be put in a care home"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/30/00/16653106-0-image-m-4_1564443027494.jpg","title":"Google camp guests Harry Styles Katy Perry Orlando Bloom Leonardo DiCaprio Bradley Cooper","story":"Copy Katy in a floral jumpsuit by Faithfull The BrandShop similar at NET-A-PORTERKaty Perry is living it up in Ibiza and of course, the singer was looking her usual stylish self as she enjoyed her holiday.Like many other A-listers, it seems Katy has fallen for the charms of fashion-pack favourite label, Faithfull The Brand.

It is very different from what say Sophie Wessex or Kate Middleton have offered.\u0027Vogue, which is edited by Edward Enninful has confirmed Meghan was not paid for her guest editorship and none of the money raised by magazine\u0027s advertising or cover price will go to charity.Vogue\u0027s owner Conde Nast however contributes to good causes throughout the year.

Now, some writers are losing faith in ‘the Mike Pence rule’Joshua Harris was just 22 in 1997 when he published I Kissed Dating Goodbye, a dating guidebook for young Christians that advised them to do anything but. Dating was a “training ground for orce”, he argued in the book, which sold almost 1m copies worldwide. It also made Harris a superstar in the Christian purity movement, a pro-abstinence crusade that began in evangelical churches in the 1990s and became well-known in the purity ring-wearing hands of Jessica Simpson and the Jonas Brothers. Many authors came after Harris – John and Stasi Eldredge, Hayley DiMarco, Tim and Beverly LaHaye – all of them in the US, where religious publishing is worth $1.22bn (£1bn) a year.Now 44, Harris made headlines this week when he revealed he no longer considers himself a Christian. He has been issuing apologies for his own books over the last decade, even making a documentary called I Survived Kissing Dating Goodbye. On his Instagram this week, he wrote: “I have lived in repentance for the past several years – repenting of my self-righteousness, my fear-based approach to life, the teaching of my books, my views of women in the church, and my approach to parenting to name a few.”Dianna E Anderson, who left the purity movement in her 20s and is the author of Damaged Goods: New Perspectives on Christian Purity, says its relationship guides have inflicted lasting damage on young people desperate to preserve their holiness while battling hormones.“As a woman, I was taught that women don’t feel or experience desire, so I suppressed any and all thoughts along that way, to the point where I was practically asexual all the way up until I was 23, and I didn’t date until I was 25,” she says. “Turns out it’s really hard to date when you’re a super-repressed purity-obsessed evangelical.”Most Christian purity guidebooks dish out similar advice. The golden rule: no sex before marriage, ever. The relationships are always heterosexual and monogamous, while the sex is always deeply conventional – a mindset that has left a generation of Christian teens muddled on the “purity” of acts like oral sex, and inspired the Garfunkel and Oates tune The Loophole.Anderson still lives with the after-effects of being raised on such ideas. As a teenager, she believed that women didn’t feel arousal and men were uncontrollable, which “caused me to imagine that losing my virginity would essentially be rape. That if I wasn’t married, then the only other way I would lose my purity would be if I wasn’t strong enough and a date raped me. Of course, I didn’t see it as rape – I saw it as a man being animalistic and just giving in to his sin. I had no mechanism for understanding that I could possibly consent, and that it would be something I would want to do. In my teenage, evangelical imagination, I hoped and prayed to be put in a scary sexual assault situation so that I could prove how faithful I was to God.”Harris is now leaving his wife after 21 years of marriage. Anderson says disillusionment is not uncommon in a movement built on the fallacy that if you marry young and abstain, you’ll be happy. But she does not think others will follow Harris’s lead, as criticism tends to make them double down on their beliefs. “You see this throughout the Southern Baptist Convention, and through the abuse scandals at Harris’s former denomination, Sovereign Grace Ministries. They refuse to acknowledge that a sexual ethic based simply on telling women they have to say no until they’re married, at which point they cannot say no any more, is flawed.”For many like Anderson, Harris’s apology is too late, having spawned a whole subgenre of books by authors who won’t also recognise the damage they have done.“I don’t think evangelicals should be contributing to the conversation about purity and sex anymore. It’s time for them to listen,” she says. “As a queer woman, I was so repressed that I didn’t discover my own queer identity until I was in my late 20s, and I feel like important parts of myself were stolen from me because of this theology. At this point, it’s their job to listen. Unfortunately, they don’t seem ready to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0256bb316edeb4c9dc524291382d12348b6edf65/254_84_3089_1853/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d94b7958c78abb93e2c97840c1f3026","title":"aston martin shares plunge after carmaker posts near 80m loss","story":"Demand from dealers for firm’s luxury vehicles slumped in the UK and across EuropeAston Martin Lagonda’s shares plunged by more than a fifth after the luxury carmaker reported a near-£80m loss in the first half as demand from dealers slumped in the UK and across Europe.The beleaguered company, which last week issued a shock profit warning that sparked a share price fall of more than a quarter, reported a pre-tax loss of £78.8m in the six months to the end of June.Aston Martin has slashed its annual sales forecast from a range of 7,100 to 7,300, saying it now expects to sell 6,500, reflecting low orders from car dealers concerned that they will not be able to sell them.Palmer said that the company has so far only had to spend a “negligible” amount on Brexit preparations but did not want a no-deal exit from the European Union.“In the case of a deal we are prepared and relatively well insulated but not immune,” he said. “Obviously, we do not want a no-deal Brexit because of the disruption that causes with issues at the border.

But is it achievable?The Champs Élysées is one of the most famous streets in the world, but you could say the French were beaten to it by the Mughals. About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India’s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height.It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages.In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or chandni – giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (chowk means open market space). On hot summer evenings, the Bishti, a tribe of water carriers, would sprinkle water from their goat-hide canteens to cool the street.But while the Champs Élysées has retained its grandeur, Chandi Chowk and the area around it have degenerated into a mess of heaving crowds, dense traffic, decrepit buildings, pavements taken over by hawkers, tangled overhead electrical wires and general mayhem. The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India.In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva’s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date.On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground.Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia’s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods – but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning.“This is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,” says Sachdeva. “It represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.”He says western designs don’t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people.One of the first decisions he made was to not recreate the canal. “We know from our other projects that we can’t look after bodies of water in India. They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.”Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction.Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage.Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their havelis – mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter – and moved to modern houses in south Delhi.Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city – New Delhi – on the south side of Old Delhi.Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world. Most living here want it preserved as a beautiful historic quarter where visitors can walk without fear of being run over and where residents can enjoy a good quality of life.“It’s about restoring the original beauty of Old Delhi but it’s also about being good for business,” says Santosh Verma, the owner of a stationery shop. “We need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos.”The revamp of the entire area has been discussed for more than 15 years but no government has had the will to push it through. Sachdeva believes the Chandni Chowk project will kickstart the transformation of the whole Old Delhi area, but he has run into his own problems.A group of conservationists and architects have filed petitions in the Delhi high court objecting to one major feature of Sachdeva’s design: the placing of utilities in the central median. They claim this will act as a “wall” between the two sides of the street and destroy the area’s visual integrity.“In redeveloping an area you must respect its heritage, but the spirit of this processional avenue is being destroyed with this design,” says AG Krishna Menon, an architect and urban planner. “You can’t put electrical transformers and public toilets in the middle. It breaks up the whole vista. They need to be somewhere else.”In his studio on the fringes of the capital, Sachdeva sounds weary rather than angry. His design has already been through numerous consultations with multiple stakeholders. While he respects the need for democratic debate, he insists there is no other suitable location for the toilets. As for the transformers, if he had placed them away from the central median and closer to the shops and pavements, the shopkeepers would have been up in arms.“They would have objected. It’s also a safety hazard. Transformers have caught fire in the area. We have to keep them away from the shops and sidewalks,” he says. “Moreover, this is not a conservation project. It is not conserving a monument like the Taj Mahal. This is about re-developing a living street where people live and work. You have to strike a balance between heritage and their needs.”Sachdeva hopes the high court judge will let the scheme proceed. “People here have been waiting a long time for this transformation,” he adds. “We can’t disappoint them.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

Our experts weigh inAll of the Democratic participants in last night’s debate harshly criticized the American economic system that rewards the most advantaged and further marginalizes the disadvantaged – but this winner-take-all system is also at work in the Democratic primaries. Even though nearly all the candidates delivered energetic, policy-dense, and largely gaffe-free performances, the end result is that the most prominent figures on the stage – Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – will remain in the top echelon of candidates, while most of the rest are finished.Though the debate did nothing to change the candidates’ relative positioning, it did surface the differences between the Democratic party’s progressive wing (led by Sanders and Warren) and its moderate wing (here represented by most of the other candidates), which are significant and have real bearing on whether the Democrats will end up moving too far to the left to be able to defeat Trump in 2020.If John Delaney and Tim Ryan had been substantial candidates, their criticisms of the progressives’ positions on issues like decriminalization of border crossings, healthcare for undocumented immigrants, abolition of private insurance under Medicare for All, imposition of a wealth tax, the Green New Deal and opposition to free trade might have put Sanders and Warren on the defensive. But since they are in fact back-bench representatives whose candidacies may have gasped their last after the debate ended, their critiques merely provided an opportunity for the progressives to grandstand about how Democrats need to show moral courage and not imitate Republicans.All in all, however, this event felt like an undercard to the following evening’s much-anticipated rematch between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Democrats may remember it as a missed opportunity to get at the real issues iding the party, which might have been discussed in a more illuminating way if there had been fewer candidates on stage.But black voters know that campaign promises rarely materialize once a candidate becomes president, so one’s reputation, trustworthiness, and passion tend to be what wins black support. On this score, the candidates were who we thought they were. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were the only two on stage who entered the evening with observable black support in their coalition, and it will remain that way after tonight. Though Marianne Williamson managed a few applause lines on race, Joe Biden’s comfortable lead with black voters – and, thus, the inside track to the nomination – is quite safe.With 45 minutes of Tuesday’s Democratic debate dedicated to healthcare, it gave Senator Bernie Sanders ample time to distinguish himself from the candidate pool. Sanders offered his expected talking points on the failures of the current system and policy solutions, but he also called out CNN’s own advertising dollars from healthcare companies and the moderators for parroting conservative talking points.He broke from his relatively congenial approach in the first debate with pointed digs at John Delaney – who may be the most diametrically opposed candidate to the senator politically – epitomizing the break between tepid Democratic politics of old and popular policies on the left. Sanders clarified that healthcare is not a “business” when Representative Delaney attempted to flaunt his corporate savvy, and he noted that healthcare was not something to profit from, as Delaney has in his career.Despite questioning that appeared more like an interrogation, Sanders handled these opening minutes expertly and he stayed focused throughout, keeping his eyes on the need for structural change to improve the livelihood of the working class.Elizabeth Warren won Tuesday’s debate but it was far from a knockout. John Delaney, a former three-term Maryland congressman and businessman, stood toe-to-toe with Warren and Bernie Sanders during the two-plus-hour contest and exited unbowed.Delaney hammered away at Medicare for All, which would outlaw private health insurance and raise taxes on the middle class. He became another reminder that the Democratic party is populated by moderates too – as if Joe Biden’s frontrunner status weren’t enough.It was only after Delaney had dinged the evening’s presumptive co-stars that Warren pushed back: “I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president … to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for.” She also made a case for electability.Warren’s performance won’t propel her to the lead. More likely, it will boost her chances of derailing Sanders and emerging as the last progressive standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e0ad79820be7bbc2b196480771e844dcc8315a/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a88bf21ba2de3b2ce8a6d569870a105","title":"i was only going to give up alcohol for a month but i wasnt prepared for the impact it had","story":"I drank to pretend my life was more interesting. Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed itNow what? I have given up alcohol for a month. That’s nothing special. Thousands of people do Dry July or Feb Fast or some random month. But it is a big thing. I hadn’t had 30 days off alcohol my entire adult life.The reason I thought it was a good idea isn’t unique either. It’s boringly familiar. I’m middle aged and, after drinking modestly for decades, it had crept up. One glass of wine a night became two, and then three and – no point in skirting around the facts here – too often it was a bottle, sometimes more. Occasionally, if I was particularly anxious, I’d buy a bottle of wine during the day and drink the lot.There’s shame in even writing that, but it’s true. Over the past few years, my husband and I had countless discussions and a few raging arguments about cutting back alcohol, and we tried the obligatory “alcohol-free nights”. But in the jargon of the online crowd experimenting with the previously unthinkable, I was “sober curious”.One of my main worries was what on earth I would do in the evenings. Drinking was what I “did” – preferably alone in my head or watching some Netflix show or offering random opinions on Twitter.Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed it. Work was interesting but I lacked ambition. I avoided people, not especially enjoying everyday things like going for a walk, or a seeing a movie, or meeting friends for lunch. It took me a few years to grasp it, but alcohol was controlling my life to an extent that I found it hard to hide, even to myself. I had watched my father commit the slow suicide of the middle class, slumped drunk in front of the television. I had contempt for him at the time, and I was becoming him.Every person is different. Jill Stark was a young single woman when she wrote High Sobriety, and her tussle with alcohol was about social binge drinking. Peter FitzSimons wanted to lose weight and shape up and I envied his blokey pragmatism – “stop being a piss-head” seemed as good advice as any. I have friends with demanding jobs raising young children alone and they really, really feel like a drink after all-day playdates.I often quoted Hemingway: “I drink to make other people more interesting.” But it wasn’t true. I drank to pretend that my life was more interesting than it was, to escape from everyday problems, and because I enjoyed it. Or maybe that’s self-justifying crap. Maybe it’s just that alcohol is an addictive substance like all of those illicit drugs we demonise and, over the years, I had become addicted.So, now what? The problem with giving up alcohol for a month is that it’s ridiculously, unexpectedly good. I had entirely novel experiences. Like meeting friends for a drink before the theatre and not drinking. Like not drinking on a Friday night. Like going to a family lunch and sipping mineral water. Like going to a book launch and standing around for an hour without drinking the warm, cheap white wine.The month wasn’t entirely alcohol free. I drank one night, on Monday 15 July. It was the day my healthy, vibrant, full-of-life mother, out of the blue, was diagnosed with a very serious illness. My first thought was automatic – “I need a drink” – and I drank a bottle of red wine, feeling overwhelmed by sadness, trawling through the internet to read up on the disease, and expecting the worst about how my family would emotionally cope.But what happened the next day was, for me, astonishing. I had a slightly hungover thought: “Drinking won’t help. It won’t help me, and it won’t help Mum. Drinking will make things worse.” I had never had such a thought in my life.There is a sense of achievement in doing something you weren’t quite sure you could do, even something relatively modest as giving up booze for a month. But I wasn’t expecting the scale and scope of its impact. After two weeks or so, I posted on my Facebook page: “Have discovered (a bit of a surprise to be honest), am a better, kinder, more present, more energetic, more productive, happier person when I don’t drink. What a bummer!”I was only going to give up for one month but these things were hard to dismiss. I was more mentally available for friends and family, a better listener, less swift to judge. I was more productive, and the stir of ambition returned. I ate better, exercised more. I slept like a baby, no longer waking up feeling foggy. I was a happier person.As an over-researcher, I read countless articles and several books. Alcohol is a toxic, addictive substance that our body works hard to expel. That’s it. I’m not preaching but it’s the truth and we all kind of know it. It’s so ubiquitous, so glamorised in popular culture, so cleverly advertised, we’re in communal denial, although that seems to be slowly changing.It’s difficult to argue with the largest and most detailed research into the global impact of alcohol, which found that the idea that “moderate drinking” was harmless or even beneficial was a myth (one that the alcohol industry promotes relentlessly). The more you drink, the worse the risks, but even occasional drinking is bad for you.Alcohol causes several forms of cancer and increases your risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Its role in violence is undeniable. In Australia, it causes more harm than any other drug. The evidence is there, but still, what a bummer. If I’m honest, what I missed most is that feeling 30 minutes or so after the first drink. The feeling of bliss, when problems float away. I was indeed invincible, witty, about to do brilliant things any moment now. Short-lived, un-ironic, self-aggrandisement.Could that feeling, however brief, whatever the price, be worth it? Part of me still thinks yes. Surely I can reduce drinking and still get to feel that euphoria, that numbing of incessant thoughts, that fading of inhibition.But after one month, the benefits of sobriety outweighed the benefits of alcohol, no matter how hard I tried to spin it. While my husband looks forward to Alcohol August, I am thinking of going another month without booze. I can’t say I won’t drink again – the thought is terrifying – but the ledger leans too far one way to be ignored.Cheers to that.• Comments on this piece will be premoderated"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b874254e2ce7cbc997f5a55be2df8584aa6ea1/0_327_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2101d5604312723d32926581c3962bd","title":"crocodile found with surgical plate in its stomach","story":"The orthopaedic device was discovered inside 4.7m animal that died in central Queensland last monthAn orthopaedic plate found in the stomach of a Queensland crocodile could possibly bring closure to the family of a missing person.The plate, with six stainless steel screws, was inside the 4.7-metre MJ, who died a month ago after a fight with another large crocodile at Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton.Farm workers who cut open his gut to try to establish a cause of death found the approximately 10cm-long metal object.They have been told the Swiss-made plate is “quite an old model”, said the farm manager, John Lever, but an identification code has been worn off owing to acidity in the animal’s stomach.“It could have been used in a pet or in human surgery, we don’t know,” Lever told Australian Associated Press. “It could have been in the crocodile’s stomach for 45, 50 years.”Staff have been discussing the discovery with social media users and doctors but police are not yet involved.The croc had been at the farm about six years after being bought from another farm in north Queensland, Lever said.Inquiries about its habitat in the wild are being made with the original farm.Lever said his instinct was the plate had belonged to a human.“That’d be our desire – if we can help solve a cold case,” he said. “If we could put some minds at rest, it would be absolutely delightful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57625fac7d728edf4734a48255990ea23953101d/66_0_3368_2021/master/3368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3c3358dcae40c0f8d3dc04b78e2c7e4","title":"tweet web cloud technology transforms meaning of nature words","story":"Usage changes from describing outdoors to depicting digital life in just one generationTweet, web, stream and cloud may once have evoked the wild outdoors, but they are now predominantly used to describe technology, according to new linguistic research.A study of datasets of informal conversations from different decades has found that the implied meaning of some common nature words in Britain has almost completely changed in a single generation.The meaning of “tweet” has changed most dramatically, with all mentions of the word in the 1990s referring to birdsong and just one in 100 in the 2010s retaining that natural meaning, with all other usages referring to social media posts.Dr Robbie Love, a linguistics fellow at the University of Leeds who conducted the study for the National Trust, said: “Language represents what’s important to a culture or society. Nature language being replaced or used less frequently suggests nature potentially becoming less important or being replaced by other things.”Love’s analysis found that other words to have decreased in relative frequency, particularly among young people, between the 1990s and the 2010s included lawn, picnic, snow, jungle, pond, mountain, soil, rock, bird, garden and shell.Andy Beer, a regional director of the National Trust, said: “Nature connection isn’t just about playing outside. It means using all the senses – actively noticing nature, such as the way gorse growing wild by the coast can smell like coconut, how fog in the autumn can cling to your hair, how a spider web can sparkle on a dewy morning, and enjoying the eye-catching popping of colours of wildflowers that grow in the cracks in the pavements and waste ground during the summer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90310a71463b457dc9015ab88208bf6756ebb20/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf90f00aabb31d8e4c4de07ad590d29","title":"uks cherry industry bounces back after 20 year hiatus","story":"Some supermarkets no longer need to import cherries in summer to meet demandThe UK’s cherry industry, which nearly collapsed 20 years ago, has bounced back with predictions of a bumper harvest this year.Cheap imports and high production and labour costs decimated the sector, but British growers are now set to produce about 6,500 tonnes of cherries – double the 3,168 tonnes picked in the UK last year and the highest for nearly 50 years.Tesco says production is once again thriving and is now so strong that – along with Waitrose – the supermarket no longer needs to import the fruit during the British season in order to meet customer demand.The UK season is notoriously short – from mid-June to mid-September, with late season cherries coming from Scotland. Production hit rock bottom in 2000 when the entire British cherry industry produced a paltry 559 tonnes, and with supermarkets stocking cheaper fruit from Spain, Turkey and the US.Now more and more British growers are enjoying better yields by using dwarf root stock, grafted on to new tree varieties. These produce smaller trees which can be grown in plastic tunnels, creating a microclimate with temperatures similar to the Mediterranean. Picking can be done more efficiently by workers on foot rather than on ladders.Tesco cherry buyer Jordon Watson said: “Not only is the industry back on track after a long hiatus, but the quality of the fruit this year is first-class with soft flesh, ripe with juice and an unrivalled sweetness and taste.”Sarah Neaves, whose family farm supplies Tesco with cherries, was one of the first British growers to plant the new smaller trees. “Over the last 10 years we have planted approximately 40,000 and, coupled with polytunnels to protect the orchard, this has revolutionised our farm,” she said.Another key move from Tesco has been to take an early ripening variety called Merchant, which has helped extend the British season by several weeks.“British cherry growers are continuing to innovate and invest in new varieties and techniques every year to increase the reliability of the once incredibly volatile crop,” said Matt Hancock, chair of Love Fresh Cherries (part of the British Summer Fruits industry body), “meaning growers can adapt better to often unpredictable weather in the UK.”David Matchett, head of food policy at Borough Market, said: “Cherry is the quintessential English stone fruit, however its short season means that most folks’ experience of it will be from an eastern European variety, which has been frozen, preserved, glacéed or concentrated. “This is missing out on one of nature’s finest flavours – if life is a bowl of cherries, then these would have been hand-picked that morning from a Kent orchard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05d55532fd74ac81135444c7df849eb3410c95/0_83_4558_2735/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e942e813227de2c27ef366da401ec6b3","title":"pochettino spurs job title tranfers real madrid gareth bale","story":"Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham should change his job title to coach because he has no influence over transfers after Harry Kane’s winner gave his side a 1-0 Audi Cup win over Real Madrid.Pochettino, who has previously intimated frustration with his club’s transfer policy, watched as Harry Kane’s first-half strike proved enough to see them past Zinedine Zidane’s side.

A club run on a tight budget could not afford to bulk out the squad to cope with extra fixtures in Europe, particularly as Burnley would not know whether they won through to the competition proper until after the transfer deadline. In the event Burnley gave a reasonable account of themselves in qualifying rounds against Aberdeen and Istanbul Basaksehir, before going out to Olympiakos in the play-off round.That meant Burnley’s first European adventure in half a century was short and sweet and over by the end of August. As they had lost two of their first three league fixtures by that stage no one was unduly concerned about a truncated Europa League campaign, though Dyche believes the effect of starting the season early and playing six more competitive matches than their Premier League rivals was an energy drain that began to resolve itself only around Christmas.Certainly Burnley were barely recognisable as their usual doughty selves in the first half of the season. Their first five games yielded a single point, and after Everton inflicted a 5-1 defeat at Turf Moor on Boxing Day Burnley ended the calendar year in a relegation position. That proved a turning point, however, for with Joe Hart dropped in favour of a return for the former goalkeeping favourite Tom Heaton, Burnley took 18 points from their next eight games to begin the climb out of trouble. There was still the odd scare before the end of the season but the settled side and familiar tenacity that had served the club so well in the past were on show as Burnley made sure of survival with a few games to spare.So the question for the coming season is which Burnley are we going to see? The manager has not changed and essentially the team is just the same as before. Sam Vokes dropped down to the Championship with Stoke midway through last season and has been replaced by the long-term Dyche target Jay Rodriguez, while the experienced Erik Pieters has been picked up from Stoke as left-back cover for Charlie Taylor. Peter Crouch has retired, though as he barely featured in starting lineups last season he is hardly going to be missed.One player who would be missed is Dwight McNeil, the 19-year-old winger who made such a breakthrough last season he found himself training with England and attracting attention from Tottenham and Juventus. Dyche and the Turf Moor crowd can probably accept he will be moving onwards and upwards at some point, but would ideally like another season or two from him first. Rejected by Manchester United aged 14, McNeil took the opportunity to sign academy forms at Burnley and looks good enough to perform at the highest level.He has all the pace a winger needs coupled with an appetite for taking on defenders and a willingness to track back when necessary, but what will make it difficult for Aaron Lennon to win his place back in the side is McNeil’s delivery. This is a winger with an end product, an aptitude for the early cross and even an eye for goal. Dyche did not just bring back Heaton after the Everton defeat, he promoted McNeil following a handful of Europa League outings and was rewarded with a winning goal in the next game against West Ham.With their smallish squad and the manager’s preference for retaining a settled side Burnley are one of the clubs who will be happy to see each transfer window close. Heaton has been attracting interest from Aston Villa and though Dyche has other goalkeeping options, Burnley would have to move fast if a sizeable bid came in for McNeil, or for James Tarkowski in the event of Harry Maguire’s departure from Leicester triggering a sudden demand for replacement centre-halves.Essentially, however, the Burnley blueprint will not change. Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood up front will be expected to provide the goals, with Rodriguez to provide assistance and variation, and though Burnley can play through midfield with the ball on the floor the overall plan will continue to be hitting the big lads up front as quickly as possible. It is not a complicated philosophy, but as countless opposition managers have remarked in the last couple of years, just because you know what Burnley are going to do does not make it any easier to stop them.Wood may look ponderous but he has grown into the side and the Premier League to become an effective performer. Barnes is simply one of the most consistent attackers in the top flight, and one of the most consistently underrated. There may be quicker forwards around, deadlier finishers and more elegant players to watch, but Barnes is perfectly in tune with the way Burnley play. It is hard to imagine him playing for anyone else, just as it is becoming difficult to work out what Burnley would do without him.Dyche, asked at the beginning of last season whether Burnley could consider themselves an established Premier League side, replied: “You never know”, which was a good answer considering the turbulence that was coming. Surviving a relegation scrap when it was least expected can only make the side stronger, and as long as Dyche remains in charge it is probably safe to predict another season of gradual improvement as Burnley begin their fourth Premier League campaign since winning the Championship in 2016.With their modest budget and tight-knit team Burnley may never be able to take Premier League status for granted, though they have made themselves stronger each season and have shown themselves able to deal with everything thrown at them so far. It is a delicate balancing act at Turf Moor: remove one key element from the structure and one feels the whole edifice may wobble, but until and unless that actually happens Burnley seem set to keep coming back for more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d10b15841c1f16cc9dee7435584190f9693d918b/619_91_2379_1427/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c144c3e981ccba179344aa450dd7ad3","title":"sheffield united agree oli mcburnie deal with swansea record signing","story":"Sheffield United have agreed a club-record £20m deal to sign the Swansea City striker Oli McBurnie.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Young Liverpool keeper Kai McKenzie-Lyle scored on his international debut for Guyana in 2016,” tweets Nathan Eaton. “Have any other keepers scored on their debut for club or country?”Chris Page can answer that. “One of the greatest goalscoring goalkeepers of all time, José Luis Chilavert, scored on his international debut for Paraguay in 1989,” he writes, “netting the winner from the penalty spot in a World Cup qualifying match against Colombia. That would be the first of eight international goals.”Before this game, Chilavert had never actually scored, so quite why he volunteered to take the penalty – awarded, of course, for a ludicrously reckless challenge by René Higuita – and quite why his captain entrusted him with it – even the Knowledge cannot answer. But he maintained his composure – no small accomplishment given a kerfuffle involving players, officials and riot police – to drive home what turned out to be the winning goal.Anyway, Chris continues: “A couple of less familiar names who accomplished a similar feat are Danny Cepero, New York Red Bulls’ eighth-round draft pick, and Jörg Siebenhandl, whose goal for Wiener Neustadt against Mattersburg came approximately 80 seconds into the match on the opening day of the 2011-2012 Austrian Bundesliga, making him the first goalscorer in the entire league that season.“As an added bonus, Bruce Grobbelaar for Crewe Alexandra and, very famously, Jimmy Glass for Carlisle United, both scored a goal in their last appearance for their respective clubs.”“The tackle by Sevilla’s Joris Gnagnon on Liverpool’s Yasser Larouci got me thinking: what’s the longest ban a player has received for an offence in a pre-season game?” asks Trent Duvall.Andrew Newcombe has a suggestion: “Current Heart of Midlothian boss Craig Levein was banned for 10 matches during his time as a Hearts player following an altercation in a pre-season game at Raith Rovers. Following a disagreement over defensive duties, Levein punched and broke the nose of fellow Jambo Graeme Hogg, in retaliation to a head-butt. Hogg was also handed a 10-match ban and this was added to an existing three-match ban, so he was effectively suspended for 13 matches.”At the time of the rammy, Hearts were losing to Rovers, whose striker Gordon Dalziel remembers it well. “It was just before half-time,” he told the Daily Record’s 10th anniversary piece, “and I got in between Craig Levein and Graeme Hogg and got an effort in on goal at the Raith end of Stark’s Park. Henry Smith turned it round the post for a corner but an argument then broke out between Levein and Hogg about who was meant to be marking me. I was winding them up and laughing and saying that I was having a stormer and I was a difficult player to mark at the best of times. The last thing I said to the pair of them was: ‘I don’t want you falling out over me.’ I then told them to calm down.“But Hogg then squared up to Levein. I think he threw the first punch or a shove in Levein’s direction and then they had a set-to. Levein threw two haymakers which I can only describe as a superb effort that Mike Tyson would have been proud of. I was killing myself laughing and jokingly gave Hogg the count of 10 as he was flat out. I didn’t realise the severity of the blows or the fact that Levein had actually broken Hogg’s nose. It was a couple of dull ones that Levein hit him with and, to be fair to him, it was his own teammate. It was a stupid argument over nothing in a pre-season friendly. It was typical of me during my career. I was a cheeky-chappy-type striker and I started banter with defenders and many an argument. But when trouble started I just ran like fuck.”Dan Ryazansky, meanwhile, emails to remind us that, while with DC United, Hristo Stoitchkov broke the leg of a college player in a pre-season match. He was banned for only two games.Though he was sacked not suspended, Dennis Wise earns a mention in this section.

Wise then went to Davidson’s room and fractured his cheekbone for him … while he was sleeping.And depending on your definition on the status of the Charity Shield, the 1974 stramash involving Liverpool’s Kevin Keegan and Leeds United’s Billy Bremner resulted in each missing the first 11 matches of that season.Michael Ward emails to note that, in last week’s Knowledge, we omitted Jimmy McGrory, player and manager of Glasgow Celtic, while Rob Mildren cites Heart of Midlothian’s John Robertson.Meanwhile, Martin Davies emails on the topic of Arthur Rowley, “who became Shrewsbury Town’s leading goalscorer whilst he was player-manager. Arthur came to the Shrews in 1958, leaving Leicester – for whom he had beaten season records – when only eight short of their all-time record.

I think we’ve got a year – maybe two – before the water takes us too,” said Pineda, 24. “It won’t be long.”Golden beaches once helped transform this fishing community on the Gulf of Fonseca into a thriving tourist destination. Nowadays, however, there are barely a few metres of sand left, and rising water levels and tidal surges have wiped out roads, homes and businesses.Locals estimate that around a metre of ground is lost every year – which means this entire community will soon be under water. The same predicament is faced by settlements along the Pacific coast of Honduras, where land and its people are disappearing fast.In recent years, millions of people have fled Central America to escape grinding poverty, institutional collapse and untrammeled violence. But another factor behind the exodus has received less attention: conflicts over natural resources which have been intensified by corporate expansion and climate change.Sea levels are rising around the world, but in this region another local factor is helping speed up coastal degradation: swathes of mangrove forests have been destroyed to make way for industrial shrimp farms which have proliferated even inside protected reserves.Many Honduran shrimps are exported to the US and the UK, where they are sold in major supermarket chains including Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.“The industry destroys huge mangrove sites promising development, but actually creates very few jobs – and actually increases poverty by restricting fishing access for locals,” said Dina Morel, director of a local marine conservation organization, known by its acronym Coddeffagolf.According to Morel, shrimp farms are routinely approved in protected areas and environmental violations rarely punished as officials often have vested interests in the profitable industry.“The consequences of losing this essential ecosystem are clear,” said biologist Victor Bocanegra. “Environmental vulnerability, food insecurity, poverty, and social decomposition, which all leads to forced migration.”Mangroves are essential to healthy, resilient coastlines. The sturdy trees protect shorelines from storms and floods, and help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their intertwined roots.They are key factors in marine bioersity, providing food, clean water, shelter and safety for fish and invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters, prawns.In order to take advantage of this natural symbiosis, acres and acres of shrimp farms have been built inland in ocean inlets which were once safe havens for tidal waves. But the farms block the natural flow of water, causing high tides and storm surges to immerse beach communities instead.On Cedeño beach, Ariana Tees, 70, is frying fish caught by her husband, Manuel, 67, in a makeshift tarpaulin kitchen just metres from the sea. This is where they live, work, eat and sleep, but every month they are forced further and further back as the ocean inches closer inland.“Of course we’re scared,” said Tees. “But we’ve nowhere else to go, and there’s no protection from the government, not even a barrier.”Manuel, who has been fishing since he was a child, said: “Every year there is less fish, and the surges have nowhere to go – so the water comes here looking for an exit. We’ve woken up in the middle of the night surrounded by water.”The shrimp industry in southern Honduras dates back to the 1970s, but grew exponentially in the 1990s. As a result, in 2000, seven mangrove forests covering over 150,000 acres were designated protected reserves.Despite this, half the region’s mangroves were destroyed between 2000 and 2010 – largely as a result of fishing concessions sanctioned before the decree, according to research by Coddeffagolf.No one knows exactly how much of the protected areas remain intact, but satellite images seen by the  suggest the situation is critical.The extent of the deforestation can be seen from a mountain peak in San José de Las Conchas, 20 miles north of Cedeño, where the panorama reveals only slivers of protected mangroves nestled between massive man-made shrimp lagoons and the turquoise ocean.Locals say shrimp companies build farms in secret – hidden from view by a ring of mangroves – then obtain permits retrospectively.FundeSur, a social responsibility foundation created by the shrimp industry in 2014, claims to invest $0.02 for every pound of shrimp exported into health, education and environmental projects.But reforestation programmes, which require years of nurturing to ensure hardy shrubs, are rare. FundeSur did not respond to repeated requests for comment.“There is more deforestation than reforestation, that’s evident for everyone to see,” said Nelson Martinez a grassroots organiser from Guapinol, a nearby community badly damaged by a tidal surge three years ago. “Unless the mangroves are saved, Guapinol will disappear too.”A thin strip of land sandwiched between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Central America is especially vulnerable to the global climate emergency.Hurricane Mitch – the most deadly storm in the Western Hemisphere in over two centuries – left at least 8,000 people dead and a million others homeless and landless when it struck in 1998. It set the country’s economic development back at least 50 years and triggered the first wave of post-cold war Central American migration to the US.Yet, investment in climate mitigation and adaption programmes such as reforestation and flood defences is falling.Since a 2009 coup, a profusion water-guzzling megaprojects – including dams, mines, and African palm plantations – has fuelled social conflicts, state repression and migration.Berta Caceres, a Goldman environmental prize winner, was murdered in March 2016 in retaliation for leading opposition to the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the river Gualcarque, relied upon by the indigenous Lenca people for food, water and medicines.“The key issue connecting climate change and governments is water governance – the politics deciding who gets priority to enough good quality water,” said professor Raul Pacheco-Vega, an environmental politics scholar at the centre for economic research and teaching (Cide) in Mexico.In Honduras, the upshot of water politics is stark: every year during the rainy season, countless communities are cut off, lives are lost, and roads, bridges and schools are damaged. It is a cycle of environmental destruction that exacerbates poverty and drives migration as families search for food, water and safety.In October, six people were killed after two days of torrential rain triggered landslides and the river Choluteca burst its banks. The town of Marcovia, 14 miles inland from Cedeño, was inundated and its habitants forced to leave.Soon after, hundreds of people from the nearby city of Choluteca joined a caravan of migrants heading north through Mexico to the US border.Half a million Hondurans heading north have been apprehended by US and Mexican officials since October 2016.The motives for migration are always complex, but in this region, environmental factors are increasingly important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ae47f3e45c7e2286ee895777fbd1e456d86816/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cee11c622e6629d8a3710bfe69e43a0","title":"god land lyz lenz excerpt journey find church","story":"After a lifetime of attending evangelical churches, Lyz Lenz went on a journey to find a place where she didn’t need to pretend to be an obedient wife, and not much else Since moving to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2005, my husband Dave and I had attended almost 20 churches. One church we went to never invited us into a Bible study. When I asked a pastor or a Sunday school teacher about Wednesday night Bible studies, I was always told to ask someone else, who told me to ask someone else. This went on for five months, until one Sunday the pastor preached a sermon about the importance of small groups and said from the pulpit that all we had to do was ask to be invited. We never went back.Or there was the church we visited in 2006 that sent three teams of elders to prayer walk around our townhouse. I sent them packing after I opened the door and asked them what they were doing. “Can we speak to your mom?” asked one of the older gentlemen in a suit and a tie.“I am the mom,” I said and slammed the door shut. They left a flyer under the door and walked around our townhouse praying once more, for good measure.After three years of searching, Dave and I finally ended up at an Evangelical Free church. There we met other couples and got involved with the youth group. But even then, that church wasn’t an easy fit for us. Or, I should be clear, it wasn’t an easy fit for me.The church was a lot like the Evangelical churches Dave and I had attended as kids – raucous music, a pastor who gave sermons that often included video clips and pop culture references. There was no liturgy, there were no organs and most of the people who attended seemed to be our age. Few people drank, no one smoked and they all loved to discuss the Book of Revelation after one too many Mountain Dews at a church party.While I loved the people there, I didn’t like the church’s theology. The church was and is very conservative their theology was that of the Evangelical Free Church of America, which doesn’t affirm women or gay people as pastors or elders. Strict gender roles were enforced and even seen as freeing. Everybody was white.As someone who doesn’t like to wear bras on principle, I frequently found myself chafing against the strict orthodox interpretation of the Bible and the long lectures I was often given by male members of the church about how if I believed women could be pastors I was questioning the inerrancy of the Bible.But in those early days of my marriage and my adult life, I thought that these problems were minor squabbles. Something to be hashed out over late nights playing board games and drinking wine, or wine for me, Fresca for the rest of them. It was a breezy naivety, born of my childhood raised in an Evangelical homeschool subculture in Texas. Until I went to high school at a public school, everyone I knew believed in a literal six-day creation by the hand and voice of God. Everyone believed that being gay was a sin.I was used to being the outsider – the lone voice of dissent. I was comfortable with this role because I wasn’t threatened by it. Not yet, anyway. I wasn’t gay. I wasn’t a person of color. I was a woman, but the gentle grasp of patriarchy hadn’t yet threatened to strangle me, because I hadn’t yet tried to get free. Or perhaps I had, but I was so used to a religion that told me I was wrong and objectionable, it never occurred to me there could be another way.Faith was also so much more to me than a God I occasionally sang songs to in church or prayed to over meals. Faith had provided the entire fabric of my existence. It was the cytoplasm in which I existed – the amniotic fluid that sustained my relationships with my husband and my family. It’s the air I was raised with. My mother read the Bible to us in the mornings, and my father read it to us before I went to sleep at night. I could not conceive of myself outside of religion.Because I could not imagine life outside the womb of my faith, I struggled inside its limitations. I thought there would always be room for me. But the reality was, there was only room for me if I made myself smaller and smaller and smaller, until I disappeared. Or else I’d be pushed out into a bright new horrible, beautiful world, where I would gasp and scream and try to breathe, for once, on my own.But in those early days, I kicked around, trying to make my place, approaching my disagreements head on. During a membership class at our Evangelical church, the one we’d later leave, I eagerly debated the head pastor, Travis, over whether the Bible supported female ordination. My husband, who agreed with the church’s stances, sat stony-faced as I recited the arguments I’d learned from my Lutheran friends and from reading books such as Ten Lies the Church Tells Women. The pastor gamely debated me, but stood strong. “I agree the topic needs more investigation” was all he would allow.And I took it, that proffered breadcrumb, as a promise to journey together – to listen to one another. I took it as a sign of respect. And that’s all I needed. I didn’t need to be right, I just needed to be treated like someone smart, someone with something to offer besides filling a nursery volunteer spot on Sunday mornings. I needed to be treated like a person.The promised investigation never came. That offer was just a way of putting me off, shutting me up. A year later, when I asked if we could have a Bible study that opened up the topic, I wasn’t shut down, I was just ignored. I asked the question of the pastor and he smiled and said: “I’ll think about it.” Nothing else. And every time I brought it up, that’s what I was told. “I’ll think about it.”Death by a thousand maybes.It’s a passive-aggressive technique – a denial by silence. There is nothing to fight against. Just resolute lips and an unfocused gaze, that refuses to see you, your desperation, humanity and longing. I’m used to that look. I get it a lot. Or at least, I used to.I’ve spent my whole life in conservative Evangelical churches. Born the second of eight kids and raised in Texas, I spent my spiritual childhood hearing hour-long sermons in humid, brown churches filled with the Holy Spirit and brisket and pastors who sweat through their shirtsleeves proclaiming the second coming of the Lord.In Sunday school, we looked for signs and revelations of the impending apocalypse: the tentative peace recently brokered in the Middle East, the talk of rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem, the war on religion we were told that Janet Reno was perpetuating with the attacks on Ruby Ridge and Waco. I went to sleep afraid I’d wake up to find my whole family raptured. When I went to the toilet, I prayed to Jesus not to call me up to heaven right then and there with my pants pulled down.At home my father taught us that numerology showed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s name worked out to 666. My mother made us read The Hiding Place, and we talked about what we’d do in the end times when we were persecuted for our faith.I read Frank Peretti’s books, hiding under the covers, dreaming about the thin veil between the spiritual world and the one where I bit my nails and prayed for Jesus to make me good. I was no good in the churches of my childhood – I was too loud, too demanding, I looked too much like a boy, I asked too many questions.By the time I was 18 years old, I’d been in small churches where pastors slept with congregants and in megachurches where youth pastors slept with teens. I’d seen gay women kicked out of the congregations they loved because they wouldn’t apologize for who God created them to be. I’d seen my friend, pregnant at 16, asked to stop singing with the worship team, while the boy who was the father still led prayers on Wednesday nights. By the time I finally went to college, I had given up. For four years, I never went to chapel. I still believed in God, but I didn’t believe in church.After I graduated and married Dave, who’d been raised in the soft evangelicalism of the upper-middle-class white midwestern suburbs, I was determined that we would find a new church together one that fit both of us.We moved to Cedar Rapids for his job, and the first thing he did was make a list of all the churches he wanted to visit. Without my input. In hindsight, this wasn’t a good sign. But it’s also how he put together our budget, planned vacations and bought cars. I had a choice – and that choice was to choose from the options on his spreadsheet. And when you are young and in love and used to the patriarchy as a modus operandi, well, you put up with a lot of things without thinking.Dave and I worked through the list in alphabetical order until we finally settled into the Evangelical Free church. We weren’t looking for perfection, we just wanted a home. Or, more accurately, I wanted a home. I wanted a place that would accept all of me. Where I wouldn’t be forced to hide my questions and my doubts, swallow my fears and outrage and get along. Perhaps that’s why, when Pastor Travis told me we’d talk about it later or that he was thinking about my idea of the Bible study examining the woman’s role in the church, I took him at his word.Compliance is easier than questioning. The appearance of unity is easier than the messy actualities. And I think part of me always understood that if I pushed too hard, I would be cast out of everything I knew. That I’d lose everything. So I smiled during sermons I hated. I kept silent during Bible studies where people spoke of dinosaurs and humans roaming the earth together before Noah’s flood.Dave and I put everything into that church. We volunteered with the youth on Wednesday nights, I helped with the coffee every Sunday and in the nursery, and we went on a trip to Israel and on a mission trip to El Salvador.On that mission trip, everything fell apart. It fell apart because I asked to lead the prayer during devotionals one morning. Steven, the pastor leading the group, had frowned and told me that wasn’t my place. I was furious. I had a specific story I wanted to share. One of our local hosts, a woman and a pastor, had taken me with her on her visits to the sick people in the village. I’d used my Spanish-English dictionary to talk to a man about how my sisters had been hit by a car, just like he had. How one of my sisters also had a hard time walking. It was a small moment of connection that I wanted to tell everyone about, and I wanted to pray for him.But Steven was upset because I had been with a female pastor, and he didn’t think it was my place to be leading even devotions in our majority male group. Steven’s approach even angered Dave. When I had told Steven that nothing in the Bible prevented me from talking out loud in a small group, he replied by saying: “It’s there in the scripture, right here where you are told to submit.”When Dave and I returned from the trip, we met with Pastor Travis and voiced our concerns. We had heard that other people had similar concerns with this same pastor, and I said that.“You know who,” I said. “They told me they told you.”“No one told me anything,” he said.My husband spoke up. “We know people have talked to you about how this man treats people.”Pastor Travis bowed his head and folded his hands for a moment. When he looked up, he met my husband’s eyes and said: “You are right. I don’t know why I lied and I apologize to you.”“Apologize to me,” I said. “You lied to me, not to him.”“I did apologize to you when I apologized to your husband,” Pastor Travis replied, looking not at me but at Dave. We had been going to that church for five years together and here I was, not even worthy of an apology.I had trusted Pastor Travis. I had believed that, even though we disagreed, he saw me as a human – smart, worthy of time and consideration. But in that moment, with his resolute lips and gaze focused somewhere over my head, I saw that I wasn’t a whole person to him. I wasn’t even worthy of my own apology. Whatever story I had told myself about mutual respect turned out to be just a lie. That offer to “journey together” was just a coded way of saying: “You’ll eventually grow up and agree with me.” It wasn’t the last time I heard that phrase.Pastor Travis and Steven did try to reach out with apologies for the misunderstandings, but I refused to speak to them. There was no misunderstanding. I thought I was a smart person, fully capable of studying the Bible and engaging with spirituality on my own, and they disagreed. When someone denies the very core of who you are, it’s hard to dialogue.There are so many churches that remain strong while being awful to women or providing safe havens for the power hungry. And there are so many good places that close despite being a home for the hungry, the lost and the hurting. To brush off problems with churches as the problems of the inherently flawed nature of people is to miss the bigger picture: that life and faith can function together in a place where all are welcome and respected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/712211fe44523bf037833d546636e5cbc36abed2/0_0_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6175dede3d4e768818cfd30f703439a","title":"how to keep valuables safe use cereal and toy boxes say ex burglars","story":"Panel of ex-offenders reveals underwear drawers and pillows are first places to be checkedForget hiding your valuables under your pillow, in a safe or stuffing them in your underwear drawer – those are among the first places professional burglars look for jewellery and cash.A panel of former burglars, brought together by department store chain John Lewis, have advised holidaymakers that the safest places for family heirlooms are actually cereal boxes or storage for children’s toys.He said people often keep valuables, such as car keys, in their kitchens but they are usually easy to find. “Most people have got a ‘bits and bobs’ cupboard in their kitchen where they often keep their keys,” he told experts at John Lewis home insurance. “DVD cases is another good place to hide valuables because they are harder to find.”People were also advised to stash valuables inside toy boxes in children’s bedrooms saying that there was an “unwritten rule” that thieves do not enter kids’ rooms.The panel of six ex-burglars, who were put in touch with John Lewis via the St Giles Trust charity which helps ex-offenders back into legitimate work, said the rise in online shopping has made it much easier to identify unoccupied homes.“If you’re walking down the road and see a parcel on a doorstep there is a good chance someone is not in,” a member of the panel said. “I would suggest not ordering parcels if you won’t be around when they arrive and getting neighbours to check for parcel deliveries regularly while you’re away.”The Office of National Statistics (ONS) uses two main sources for their crime data statistical bulletins: the Crime Survey for England and Wales and the police recorded crime numbers.The Crime Survey for England and Wales is a face-to-face questionnaire. People are asked about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview. The ONS say this is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends, as it isn\u0027t subject to changes in the way that police forces monitor and record crime, and it will include people talking about experiences that weren\u0027t reported to the police.\u0026nbspPolice recorded crime is the number of notifiable crimes reported to and recorded by the police. The list of notifiable crimes is determined by the Home Office. The ONS say this data is more reliable for the recording of rarer crimes, like murder, and for crimes like theft, where people are often inclined to report a crime to the police as part of an insurance claim. This data cannot measure crimes not reported to the police because victims felt them too trivial, or where they may be reluctant to come forward to the police for personal reasons.Leaving lights either on or off for long periods was also identified as a key giveaway. The best room to leave lights on when away is the hallway, the panel said, but timer switches were deemed the best option because it creates a better illusion that someone was at home.Burglars can spend up to two months watching a house before making their move, but would spend as little as five minutes inside before fleeing.Some of the ex-offenders questioned said they target identity documents – such as passports, driving licences, credit cards and bank statements – rather than stealing TVs or DVD players because of the potential gains from selling the information on.Dr Claire Nee, director of the International Centre for Research in Forensic Psychology at Portsmouth University, who has interviewed hundreds of burglars to analyse patterns in offending said: “Identity documents are very valuable at the minute due to identity theft for fraud and people trafficking.“We also know from both our research and criminal statistics that burglars are going for small, valuable items – jewellery, electronics and cash.“Finally, be careful about your conversation on the way to the airport. Talk loudly about your house sitter for instance, not about how you are looking forward to your fortnight away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1defd1391ad89d80cd6857f08f5e407b6d85f561/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c185037e04a5b401b6cfefb575f08d29","title":"lloyds puts cash aside to cover rush in ppi mis selling claims","story":"Bank is forced to put aside more cash as 29 August deadline loomsLloyds Banking Group has been forced to put aside more cash to cover a late rush in customers claiming they were mis-sold payment protection insurance, bringing its total bill for the scandal to more than £20bn.The lender took another £550m in PPI charges in the second quarter, following a “significant increase” in customers requesting information from the bank ahead of the 29 August claims deadline. Lloyds said the queries would lead to a rise in the number of total complaints and administrative costs.Lloyds said the total number of complaints it could receive is still unclear. However, it has a war chest of about £1.1bn to deal with a further rise in the total number of claims from 5.6 million to 5.8 million by the deadline.The lender, which first started taking claims in 2011, has racked up by far the largest PPI compensation bill of all the banks for what has become the UK’s largest-ever mis-selling scandal.The Lloyds chief executive, António Horta-Osório, said the bank was also keeping an eye on the impact of Brexit. He noted a drop in business investment and hiring plans across the UK in the second quarter, but said he was optimistic given Britain’s high levels of employment and the rise in real wages.Lloyds said it was “proactively” monitoring Brexit developments and assured that “various initiatives are in place” to safeguard against the risks of a no-deal Brexit, particularly for its commercial loans ision.Horta-Osório said: “The group has continued to make strong strategic progress during the first half of 2019 and delivered a good financial performance with market-leading efficiency and returns.

No deal will “potentially decimate” sheep farming, the economic and cultural lifeblood of many communities, she says.“The first thing that I’m clear about is that a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table,” says Dodds, drinking coffee in the sunshine in Crickhowell before a day of canvassing. “But beyond that, people do know what the Lib Dem position is, though – we aren’t dishonest about that – and they know we are a remain party who will campaign for a ‘people’s vote’.”Though Dodds is keen to keep issues local, the vote on Thursday will have huge national significance. Chris Davies, the ousted Conservative MP convicted of expenses fraud, is fighting again for the seat after a byelection was triggered by a recall petition.In 2017 the results were as follows:\u0026nbspDespite the guilty verdict in court and the successful recall petition, Conservatives\u0027 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If he doesn\u0027t, new prime minister Boris Johnson will find his tiny working majority in parliament further diminished.Jane Dodds is standing for the Liberal Democrats, and Tom Davies is standing for Labour. The Brexit Party will be represented by Des Parkinson.In a move intended to to avoid splitting the \u0027remain\u0027 vote in the constituency, the Green party and Plaid Cymru have decided not to stand candidates, urging their supporters to back Dodds and the Lib Dems.Lady Lily Pink is standing for the Monster Raving Loony party.Should Dodds win, the Conservative majority will dwindle to just one seat, just a week after Boris Johnson was installed as prime minister. Conservative campaigning has been low key, though Johnson is scheduled to visit on Tuesday. There are some nerves about a “Boris bounce”, but Lib Dems are outwardly confident of taking the seat, believing that Davies’ reselection as a candidate is a sign that CCHQ wants a convenient excuse for a loss. The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split.Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep. For him, a no-deal Brexit would be personal, though he is wary about stopping Brexit entirely. “I’ve always believed it was better to stay in and particularly for my business it would be catastrophic if we had no deal,” he tells Dodds. “The extra taxes make a huge difference to the margins of the business. But I do believe we need to respect democracy and people voted to come out. I don’t know if they ever realised the implications, that’s the thing.”Antonia Harrison, an activist who travelled from Portsmouth to campaign, has had to temper her pro-European enthusiasm when speaking to voters. “I’m a European first and foremost: it’s my identity, it made me determined to try and stop this,” she says. “But it is different here, I find a lot of people are saying they voted to leave. Some have said they would vote Lib Dem but because they voted leave, then they can’t this time.”One of the biggest challenges is getting around a constituency the size of Luxembourg mostly crossed by winding country lanes. Dodds says she is walking about 20km a day and driving between districts as much as three hours apart. On election day, activists will need to cover a huge area as turnout could make the difference.The Lib Dems have attracted campaigners from across the UK, as well as two who have flown over from Hong Kong and Toronto. Local organisers claim volunteers include former Tory members from London and current Labour members.On Crickhowell’s high street, opinion is ided. Robin Masefield, 33, the owner of Natural Weigh, which sells food and household products without packaging, is keen for a Dodds victory. “I hope she gets it, I just don’t support the Conservatives’ political views whatsoever,” he says. “Boris is a character, there’s no doubt about that but I do think he is likely to keep his promises. I think he’s for us: Britain will come first.”Many residents are amused, more than anything else, that the media circus is now making its way to Brecon. Marianne, a pensioner travelling down Crickhowell high street, said she had been surprised to find the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron ringing her doorbell. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Though it is local issues that will affect her vote, she says many people have found Davies to be personable and effective. “Local people are so fed up about Brexit I think they won’t want to think about it and will vote for whoever they would usually vote for. It is local things that matter more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6267b913b2b60563707fbb38990e6e5633c7c97c/0_288_5048_3028/master/5048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66c40d040dd651b596e3d2b3f4b0df3","title":"they could end up kingmakers again readers on future liberal democrats","story":"Readers share their hopes for a new movement in the UK, while others can’t forget the party’s part in austerity in the coalitionA week on from Jo Swinson’s election as leader of the Liberal Democrats, we asked readers to share their views on the future of the party.People from across the UK told of their hopes for the party under its new leader and the strength of the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit line. While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

This is not your average children’s camp. Nobody is abseiling or caving and there has only been one woodcraft session so far.“Shall we go to the den and play werewolves?” shouts Gabe, an assistant with a broad grin, described by 11-year-old Alistair as “the very best camp monitor we could have got”.The camp is run by Active Training and Education Trust (ATE), a not-for-profit organisation established in 1996, which provides residential holidays – known as “superweeks” – to school-age children throughout England. About 400 children a year attend superweeks at six centres in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Stroud and Derbyshire.Alistair is here because his school nominated him as someone who might benefit from a seven-day residential. ATE works with schools and special educational needs coordinator teachers to target children they know will benefit from the experience. His place was subsidised by ATE, with his parents and school footing a nominal £35 fee. Alistair says, “It’s a really good way to make new friends and try new things. I just love it.”ATE’s programmes director, Liz Macartney, says the nominal fee is important. “It ensures they actually turn up but is small enough so that many people can afford it,” she explains.Non-subsidised places cost £450 a week, including travel from 17 towns and cities either by coach or train. “We know that £450 is not money you find down the back of the sofa but at the same time it’s comparable with childcare costs,” says Macartney.In 2009, the organisation launched an “adventure appeal” to subsidise low-income families, who make up a third of the programme’s attendees. Since then, as many as 974 children (including this year’s cohort) have benefited from the appeal, which has raised more than £360,000. ATE also runs a scheme, sponsored by former students and supporters, that means if a family or school can pay half the fee then the trust will match it. The camps’ ethos is to be accessible to all children, whether financially privileged, at-risk or with special educational needs. “We’re not about siloing poor kids away,” says Macartney. ATE’s mission statement says: “When children are surrounded by the pressures of a hectic world, ATE believes that a period ‘away from it all’, doing simple, fun activities in a tucked away, countryside setting with others from all over Britain and beyond can be of immense value.”One notable thing about the week I’m on is that nobody’s cool – and I mean that with the greatest respect. There are no phones, no selfies, no makeup, Emma Williams explains. She is one of the camp “monitors”, or helpers – volunteers who have gone through a stringent training process and are often former attendees. She says: “It’s one of the reasons we don’t play things like football or rounders. None of the kids knows the games so everyone has a fair crack.” Instead, most games are made up by volunteers or tried and tested over the years and learned on training courses.There is also no timetable, something that might strike fear into the heart of a helicopter parent. “We decide what we’re going to do that morning, depending on mood, how the group’s feeling and what’s happened before,” says Macartney.That’s not to say there isn’t any organisation. “There’s just a lot of flexibility, which is crucial to what we do.” Similarly, every single activity is something the children can do at home. There is no fancy kit, no special outfits or equipment. Games range from wearing your pants on your head at dinner through making a bracelet out of safety pins to welly wanging (throwing) outside – and much more in between.Clare Wood, from Chesterfield, is 13. She’s on her 19th superweek, first coming when she was seven. Both older sisters are monitors. “I love meeting new people and making friends. I’ve got friends that I’ve met on previous weeks. It’s not about the inidual things we do, it’s about the whole feeling. I just love it.”Lewis Davis, 12, from London, first came two years ago at the suggestion of his school. He has now been on five camps, funded by his local authority’s children’s services after the school noticed the positive impact it was having. “It was the first time I’d spent a week away from my parents and I was a bit scared, but I loved it,” he says. “Each camp is different because there are different people and I do things like chocolate making and I make new friends.”Chris Green is coordinator of the Summer Camps Trust, a recently established charity (of which ATE is a member), which wants 1 million children participating in summer camps in Britain by 2040. “A week or so a year in a well-run residential camp, right away from phones, laptops and the pressures of the outside world, with the opportunity to play and share a laugh with others their own age from all over Britain, gives children a taste of what life in a happy community can be like,” he says. “Most children in the US, Canada, France and Italy think of their annual week at camp as the best fun of the year.”Green adds: “By giving children back some ‘real childhood’, so they spend more time playing in green fields, listening to stories and exercising their imagination, and less time posting messages on social media or sweating over quadratic equations, we might see fewer reports and articles on how miserable our children are.” He would even like a week on a summer camp to be compulsory in the UK to improve children’s mental health. In the meantime, the trust will be promoting a programme to try out summer camps in August at a low cost, which aims to recruit 500 nine- to 15-year-olds who have never yet tried a residential camp.“Short periods spent in truly happy and relaxed communities can do wonders for young people’s personal development,” says Green. “There has never been a time in our history when British children needed it more.”• To book or donate to an ATE superweek visit: superweeksadventure-appeal More details of the Summer Camps Trust “try out” programme at summercampstrust.orgbookings"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa351f7e75eb3b7540176ae42ccc351f4ea2ede8/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f1b179d5c9dd9f63c6c2fafc0390a5","title":"caster semenya blocked defending 800 metres title athletics world championships","story":"Caster Semenya will not compete at the World Championships in Doha after a Swiss court stood behind an IAAF rule that would require her to take testosterone-reducing medication.The South African had been expected to defend her world 800m title in late September after the Swiss Supreme Court had temporarily exempted her from an IAAF rule relating to athletes with differences in sexual development (DSD). That decision has now been overturned by a tribunal at the same court.In a statement issued through her PR agency, Semenya said: “I am very disappointed to be kept from defending my hard-earned title, but this will not deter me from continuing my fight for the human rights of all of the female athletes concerned.”Last month the Swiss Supreme Court temporarily suspended the IAAF rule that requires all DSD athletes to reduce their testosterone to below five nmolL for at least six months if they want to compete internationally at all distances from 400m to a mile.The rule had been at the centre of a landmark case brought against the IAAF by Semenya at the court of arbitration for sport (Cas). That case found in favour of the international athletic body and its claim that high levels of testosterone provided a material advantage in women’s competition.Semenya has refused to take hormone medication and is in the process of appealing against the Cas decision. A temporary stay of the rule had been granted while that appeal continued but the court decided to overturn that decision after finding that the “high threshold” for any suspension had not been fulfilled.Dorothee Schramm, the lawyer leading her appeal, said: “The judge’s procedural decision has no impact on the appeal itself. We will continue to pursue Caster’s appeal and fight for her fundamental human rights. A race is always decided at the finish line.”In a statement, the IAAF said: “We understand the Swiss Federal Tribunal will be issuing its full decision on this order tomorrow (Wednesday) and the IAAF will comment once the tribunal makes its reasoning public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b63449949ff2aed16370a3ec4d1d763887117c/0_0_1541_925/master/1541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=951d1a367ecb5b0f71d1e5d8dfd36bee","title":"romanian cricketer hailed as hero after admitting bowling action not beautiful","story":"Shane Warne and Jofra Archer offer encouragement to Pavel Florin, after video emerges of his efforts in European Cricket LeagueA Transylvanian cricketer whose bowling technique initially attracted online mockery has been hailed as a hero and received backing from Shane Warne and Jofra Archer after he said his love of the game trumped any criticism.Pavel Florin, a professional bodyguard by day and player-president of Romania’s Cluj Cricket Club in his spare time, became an overnight sensation after a video of him bowling against French club Dreux in the European Cricket League on Tuesday went viral.Some initial reaction to his distinctive action – and the pace and accuracy of his deliveries – was labelled as “snobbish” and damaging to the development of the game in emerging cricket nations.Florin told the European Cricket League: “Maybe someone says my bowling is not beautiful or not effective, but I don’t care, because I love cricket.“It’s not beautiful, I know, everybody says it, but I’m a slow bowler.”The 40-year-old allrounder, who took up playing cricket at the age of 32, said in an interview in May he had a top score of 36 for his club and once took two wickets in a three-over spell.Tuesday’s efforts with the ball at La Manga in Spain, where the inaugural ECL is being held, did not result in a wicket, but the one over he bowled was relatively economical in the shortened 10-over format of the game, going for just 13 runs.Florin, batting down the order, did not get to the crease as Cluj posted 69-5 off their 10 overs in response to Dreux’s 164-6. He did not bat or bowl in the two other games Cluj have played so far, both of which were lost.Asked how he thought the tournament, dubbed “the Champions League of European cricket” on its website, was going so far, Florin said: “Not very good now because we lost three matches. But we earn other things – good experience for us and for our country.”Florin’s indefatigable love of the game drew admiration from former and current professional players, with England’s Archer offering his “respect” to the 40-year-old and the New Zealand bowling coach Dimitri Mascarenhas saying “we should be celebrating this amazing achievement”.Warne also offered his support to Florin and the tournament, saying he would be happy to lend a helping hand in the future, while former Australia coach Darren Lehmann urged Florin to keep going and said, “Love the way you love the game”.Cricket is not widely played in Romania, but the country was granted affiliate status in 2013 and became an associate member of the ICC in 2017.The ECL, which says it is “committed to developing cricket in Europe”, is in its first edition, and features eight teams, including clubs from Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, playing a 10-over version of the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2431221338a83e0d60f64c8f6f602d49d54183ea/0_167_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c55135b91d6a298709eaa75922a576d","title":"england australia ashes cricket moeen ali batting","story":"I know I’ve struggled with the bat – the criticism hurts – but I’m going to play with freedom in this Ashes and should be judged on my bowlingThe Ashes are the pinnacle of Test cricket for any England player, and if we can follow up our World Cup victory by winning back the urn from Australia it would represent one of the greatest summers for the sport in this country.It would be quite an English thing to say we need to come down from the extreme high of that day at Lord’s, however. Everyone in the squad would do anything to experience it all again but what we can do is harness the feelings and confidence it gave us, not try to suppress them.Thinking back to the end of the last Ashes series, when Australia celebrated on the outfield of the Sydney Cricket Ground with those oversized hands on the podium rubbing in the 4-0 scoreline, it was obviously a very difficult time. Quite upsetting, really.But those are the moments as cricketers when you make a pledge to yourself that next time around it will be different. From my point of view, it would be great to send Australia home from nearly six months in the country with nothing to show for it.Starting this series at Edgbaston – for me the best ground in the country for home support, and probably the toughest for a visiting team – is a big plus. It was only a couple of weeks ago that we beat Australia convincingly in that World Cup semi-final. That match will be in their minds and the plan is to hit them hard again.But clearly this only goes so far. Test cricket is a different ball game and we respect our opponents. It will be my third Ashes but I expect this one to be a bit different in terms of on-field relations. It’s well known that I have personally received some abuse in the past but Australia are actually quite nice to play against these days.They decided to make a positive change to their cricket after the ball‑tampering thing blew up in South Africa last year and credit must go to Justin Langer, their head coach, and their two captains, Tim Paine and Aaron Finch, because they have turned it around in the space of 18 months.As a team we tend to focus mainly on ourselves, however. And in an Ashes series the best approach as a player is to not get caught up in feeling pressure for your position but to think only about the greater cause. How can I contribute? It could be a single moment, like a blinding catch or a run out. Think only of the team’s needs.As an all-rounder I can affect every innings of the game but in all honesty I know my batting has been a problem of late. Given I’ll probably be coming in at No 8, my primary role is with the ball and since returning to the side last summer against India my record has been strong in this department.I have accepted this for a while, the ball has been coming out nicely and in Test cricket the wickets have followed. But I would be lying if I thought the attention was on this, because even though I am not on social media these days, I am aware of the criticism of my batting in recent times.I have always been a player whose form goes up and down but at the moment I feel my batting confidence is at its lowest. Negative comments can affect you and they probably have. I know I play some horrendous shots at times but, when I do, I feel I attract more stick for it than others.I have batted everywhere in the England team and it has probably caught up with me. It’s not easy for a player who considers him or herself to be a proper batter to then adjust down the order. Put anyone there and the scores won’t necessarily come. You can lose a bit of love for it, too.But after the Ireland Test I decided to consult some of my most trusted advisers: my dad, Munir, my brother, Kadeer, and Paul Farbrace, who was the England assistant coach up until recently. I have had a little reset and the plan is to go out there and simply enjoy my batting again – to not get consumed by negative thoughts and try to play with more freedom than I have.The fact is, my bowling is why I am in the Test team right now and on form, rightly so. Runs are important, don’t get me wrong, but it will be wickets that I will be judged on.But again it comes back to how you can contribute to the cause in any way possible and that is to win back those Ashes – to make 2019 a famous double-winning year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

There is no sand visible but the hidden banks below us are written in the surrounding water in the form of ripples, white lines of surf and patches of smooth water. These treacherous shallows possess romantic names on the sea charts – Pandora Sand, Thief Sand, Stubborn Sand – but sailors’ lives depend on avoiding them.The captain of Salford, our beautifully restored whelk boat, is trying to do the opposite, however: he’s trying to run aground on one. Our depth gauge drops from 6.9m to 1.4m. We stop and wait for the tide to beach us. Will we soon discover pristine golden sand?Picnicking and playing cricket on sandbanks at low tide was regarded as a grand day out by hail-and-hearty Victorians but messing around on shifting sands is not favoured in our risk-averse era. When a BBC film crew staged a cricket match on the notorious Goodwin Sands in the Channel a few years back, the in-rushing tide turned their boat over, requiring a lifeboat rescue.So, the decision by the Coastal Exploration Company, a band of capable mariners who take visitors to less-well-known spots on the north Norfolk coast in vintage sailing boats, to restart holidaymaking on sandbanks looks a little reckless. But I had to give it a go.Dom, the skipper, steers our 30ft boat through Wells-next-the-Sea’s pretty harbour in the morning sunshine. Our plan: breakfast on the boat, while we sail west to reach the Wash at low tide and “find a nice little sandbank to dry out on,” as Dom puts it – for lunch and cricket. “Any kind of waves would pick the boat up and slam it onto the sand but these conditions are nice and calm,” he says.Wells’ straggly line of colourful beach huts framed by white sand and dark pines slowly diminish as we head into the North Sea. The calm sea may be safe for us but it’s terrible for sailing. Luckily, Salford has a new engine that purrs as we potter along the coast at 4 knots.The seas here are shallow and studded with sandbanks, many of which now house offshore wind farms. It was once Doggerland and even today it sometimes looks like you can walk across the Wash from Norfolk to Lincolnshire at low tide. I’m astonished to learn that this great expanse of low water also contains a section called The Well, which is 47 metres deep.“Everything about the water is dangerous,” warns Charlie Hodson, our expedition chef and former lifeboat man, which could come in handy. “It’s about how you respect that water in return.”Charlie gives this warning as we pass the black silhouette of a ship wrecked on the sands beyond Scolt Head Island. This vessel was deliberately scuppered and filled with explosives to stop German invaders entering Brancaster harbour but we pass two more authentic wrecks visible on the vast sandy shores of north Norfolk.Despite the depth gauge reading 1.4m, the sandbank above which we first float doesn’t appear even as low tide nears. So we sail further along this wild, tranquil coast of sand dunes, windmills and flint church towers and around Gore Point. Ahead shimmies a line of gold: Sunk Sand, rising around two metres out of the water on the lowest of tides. Cormorants stand on the bank, drying their wings like enormous bats on the far side lounge the banana shapes of a dozen grey seals.Slowly, cautiously, we head towards Sunk Sand. Just beyond 1.5m, we run aground. The water around us is still chest-deep, so we blow up an inflatable dinghy to carry our lunch. I jump in and swim “ashore”, which is not as glamorous as it sounds – it’s easier to wade in the shallow water.We step onto our own utterly otherworldly, (extremely) temporary island. We can see Hunstanton in the distance to the south and Skegness to the far north but there is nothing else, and no one else, for miles around. The sand is smooth, wet, and scattered with giant starfish and dozens of sea urchins.Abruptly, the sun vanishes and a murk creeps in. Charlie hurriedly lights his stove, showing us how to fillet the seabass in the shallows. As he rustles up lunch we notice his pop-up kitchen is getting closer to the water. The tide is coming in already. Our sandbank island is shrinking.We move the kitchen 50 yards from the sea. It only gives us 10 minutes. The tide seeps over the sand and Charlie blowtorches the locally caught seabass for his take on “fish and peas and ham with a Masala flavour”. It’s delicious, and there is just enough time for a quick game of cricket. Salford is afloat again, and suddenly looking a long way away. Storm clouds build in the Wash’s huge skies.We swim-wade hurriedly back to the boat, and head home. The sea has turned choppy, the breeze gets up, and we fly past Scolt Head Island as sandwich terns e into the water and emerge, in a twinkle, gobbling silver fish.Rain arrives just as we enter the sanctuary of Wells harbour, sailing smoothly up the channel on a rising tide.This surreal day does not feel dangerous in such capable hands. Instead, the grand peaceful arena of this coast is profoundly soothing. And the wilderness of its salt marshes is nothing compared to the wilderness out there, among the sandbanks and cormorants, a strange liminal landscape where sand meets sea and the tide is the master of all.• The Coastal Exploration Company offers bespoke sailing adventures on the north Norfolk coast.

Much of it will end up in landfill – an estimated 10,000 items of clothing are sent there every five minutes in the UK. Textile recycling is still in its infancy (recyclenow, for local fabric banks) but buying swimwear made from recycled plastic waste helps ert it from landfill and saves on raw materials and energy used in virgin fabric production.The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) recommends using marine-safe sunscreen for holidays, wherever you are, as certain chemicals can harm marine life, including creatures found in UK waters, it says.“Unfortunately sunscreens have been shown to have an impact on the marine environment – not just coral reefs but also other marine organisms,” the MCS said. “Oxybenzone and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate) are particularly harmful, and MCS recommends avoiding sunscreens with these ingredients.”Bans on sunscreen containing these chemicals are planned in Palau island in the Pacific (from 2020), Hawaii (2021), and Key West in Florida (2021), and although they are not outlawed in Mexico, many cenotes and other tourist destinations ask visitors not to use them. Sunscreen is categorised as chemical (absorbs UV rays) or mineral (creates a layer on top of the skin to deflect them). Chemical ones often require less-frequent application and, unlike some mineral ones, don’t leave a white cast on the skin. Boots says its Soltan suncream (from £3.50) contains neither oxybenzone nor octinoxate, because it sources “ingredients that protect environments across the globe”.W R Yuma 3D-prints its sunglasses from recycled plastic found on the banks of waterways around Antwerp. It and partner company Stormkop work with local children to collect and clean waste for creative projects, aiming to help change perspectives on the value of waste material. Some of the plastic is then shredded and melted into 3D printing filament (ink), and used to print glasses (from £115).Handcrafted from sustainable bamboo, Wear Panda sunglasses (from £69) have low environmental impact compared with most plastic shades. Bamboo is durable, renewable and relatively easy to grow, without needing pesticides or fertilisers. The company also works with Optometry Giving Sight, and for every pair it sells, someone without access to eye care will receive a medical eye examination and a free pair of prescription glasses.Another one-for-one initiative comes from Wildwood, which plants a tree for every pair of sunglasses sold, to help combat deforestation. Each pair of handmade sunglasses, with carved wooden frames (from £69), is named after an endangered species and comes in a natural bamboo case.Created from Planwood, an eco-material made from waste-sustainable rubberwood sawdust from its factory, and coloured with organic pigments, the PlanToys sand playset (£29.99, Babipur) includes a bucket and three fish-shaped spades. All its toys come in recycled, non-toxic packaging.“Changing the world one bubble at a time,” Dr Zigs has created a giant bubble kit (£19.99) that includes wooden wands from sustainable sources, untreated cotton ropes and non-toxic bubble mix.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

So why do many people assume it’s only for homeowners with families?Kicking the bucket. Cashing in your chips. Going for a Burton. Heading to the great gig in the sky. Whatever you like to call it, death is a daunting subject few of us are fond of talking about. Our profound discomfort when it comes to discussing the “destination we all share” (Steve Jobs) also means we procrastinate or avoid things that focus on it.Take life insurance. Many of us would feel hugely reassured knowing that, should we pass on, loved ones would be financially secure, even enjoying the same living standards as they did before. Yet, our unwillingness to broach our departures (spoiler alert: it will happen) also means there are some widely held misconceptions about life insurance. Here, the  and Aviva embark on a debunking mission to separate fact from fiction …Myth 1: Life insurance is only for homeownersOne of the few things people know about life insurance is that many policies pay out enough cash for your loved ones to settle the remainder of your mortgage when you pass away, meaning your partner andor dependents needn’t fret about meeting monthly repayments.Myth 2: We don’t have any kids, ergo we don’t need life insuranceIt’s natural that child-free couples might question the importance of life cover. After all, many insurance policies are geared around ensuring families are looked after once the breadwinner has passed away. But taking up a policy can help, particularly if you have any mortgage debt that you don’t want to saddle your partner with.Myth 4: Life insurance is expensiveWrong! Life insurance costs considerably less than most people think. At Aviva, you can take up life insurance from just £5 a month.There’s good news for clean-living fitness freaks, too. As the cost of life insurance is linked to your state of health, if you’re in good shape (translation: don’t smoke like a chimney or adopt a diet that leads to future coronaries), your quote will reflect that.Myth 5: I’ll be drowning in paperworkGetting life insurance today can take as little as five minutes online. And don’t worry about insurance professionals digging into your personal life by asking questions about your dangerous base-jumping hobby either. At Aviva, it could take as few as five simple questions before you’re covered.As for wading through impenetrable legalese or having to badger your GP for medical records, if more information is required the insurance company can do this for you.Myth 7: I’ll be paying higher premiums because I used to smokeYes, smokers pay more for life insurance. But a cursory glance at the statistics reveals why: the lung-blackening habit accounts for nearly 80,000 deaths in England every year, with one in two smokers dying from a smoking-related disease.Just because you used to smoke, doesn’t mean your premiums will increase. Aviva will take into account when you gave up smoking and whether you have any smoking-related conditions, rather than arbitrarily increasing your premium.Aviva offers life cover from just £5 a month, so life insurance is less daunting than you may think, with flexible cover length, lump sum payouts and a hassle-free claims process.

Some fell into the transept, but large amounts were transformed into dust that was carried west by the wind.Authorities at the regional health agency ARS and Paris town hall have attempted to minimise the threat to public health, but the investigative website Mediapart, Le Monde newspaper and particularly the Robin des Bois environmental group, warn of a looming public health disaster.Robin des Bois filed a lawsuit “against X” in the Paris high court on July 26th for “endangering the lives of others, failure to assist persons in danger and criminal negligence in informing the population”. A procedure “against X” allows civil plaintiffs to sue culprits whose precise identity is not known.Jacky Bonnemains, the director of Robin des Bois, told France Info radio: “Behind this X, we are targeting all involved . . . the Paris town hall, the town halls of the fourth, fifth and sixth districts, but also the ARS.”‘Hundreds of tonnes’Bonnemains accuses authorities of having known on the night of the fire that “hundreds of tonnes of lead were being reduced to dust”. Had officials warned “onlookers, tourists, journalists and residents who watched from open windows” they could have taken precautions, he adds.Up to 1.3 million micrograms of lead per square metre have been found in samples collected next to the cathedral. Across the Seine and within sight of the burned-out structure, 28,400 micrograms per square metre were found at the Saint-Michel fountain, which is still swarming with tourists.The RER commuter train station at Saint-Michel was shut for several days in late June when sticky lead residue, believed to have been carried on the soles of passengers’ shoes, was found on a passageway. The station was scrubbed down and reopened.Standards established before the Notre Dame fire said lead should not surpass 1,000 micrograms per square metre indoors, and that 5,000 micrograms was “normal background pollution level” for Paris streets. A study in 2017 of 102 samples from across the capital found an average outdoor level of 1,346 micrograms per square metre.The World Health Organisation says: “There is no concentration of lead in the blood that is not dangerous.”Annie Thébaud-Monny, a public health expert at the national health institute Inserm, told Le Monde: “The levels found are gigantic. They are comparable to what one sees at battery or appliance recycling plants. They show massive contamination which will obviously claim victims.”Thébaud-Monny accuses Paris town hall of “criminal lies” and says its minimisation of the danger is catastrophic. “Necessary precautions were not taken. There must be medical follow-up, for life, because, as with asbestos, cancers can appear 10, 20 or 30 years later.”Exposure to lead, by inhaling or ingestion through the mouth, can cause cancer, damage kidneys and reproductive organs and disrupt the digestive tract and nervous system. At the end of April, the Paris prefecture told residents near Notre Dame to “clean their home or office with damp clothes” to remove dust from the fire. The ARS later told them not to chew fingernails and to “wash frequently children’s toys and other objects they might put in their mouths”.Blood testsPregnant women and children under the age of seven on the Ile de la Cité have been advised to have their blood tested for lead poisoning, “as a precaution”.The Paris town hall announced on July 26th that it was closing a nursery school and an elementary school used for summer leisure activities in the rue Saint-Benoit, in Saint-Germain des Prés, about 2km from Notre Dame. Samples showed 7,000 micrograms of lead per square metre in one of the school courtyards. Levels were normal inside the classrooms, the town hall emphasised.Michel Cadot, the prefect of Paris, announced on July 25th that he was stopping reconstruction work at Notre Dame at least through the end of this week, based on a report from work inspectors. Precautions were “not uniformly followed and decontamination installations were insufficient”.Press photographs since the catastrophe show some workmen wearing helmets, masks, gloves and hazardous materials suits. Others wear suits but no gloves or masks. Mediapart claims the ministry of culture vetoed a plan to have men in full protective gear decontaminate the esplanade in front of the cathedral for fear it would terrify passersby.Street-sweepers and shopkeepers, tourists and local residents have no protection. The firemen’s union wrote to ARS on May 13th demanding to know what measures were taken to decontaminate fire engines that went to the site, and the firemen themselves. They are still waiting for a reply."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972762.1564561933!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bernie sanders i get a little tired of democrats afraid of big ideas","story":"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders hits out at his fellow candidates during a live TV debate, saying he is tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Video: CNN\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidates  Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Photograph:  Justin SullivanGettyIt has hosted music stars from Elvis Presley to Frank Sinatra, from Stevie Wonder to Diana Ross. But on Tuesday night the historic Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit became the venue for the opening night of the second set of Democratic debates. Ten candidates were chosen to participate in the first of two debate nights. From the get-go attention was on Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the two top-polling candidates among the first group.They did not disappoint.As had been intimated by both senators ahead of the debate, they did not take each other on. Instead the two-and-a-half hour debate became in many ways a battle between the Sanders-Warren liberal wing of the party and the remaining eight candidates, who in one way or another confronted the party elders on their policy stances.The most contentious issue of the night was healthcare, which dominated the first 45 minutes. Both Sanders and Warren defended their policy of “Medicare for all” – a single-payer system of healthcare that many believe is too far left for most of the American public to support. Others outlined their support for a public system that would allow consumers to keep their private health insurance – a priority for many Americans, according to polls. The pair also defended their support for climate change policies such as the “Green New Deal”, an ambitious infrastructure plan designed to mitigate climate change. After fellow candidates John Delaney and John Hickenlooper attacked Sanders and Warren supporting an idea they described as unrealistic – Delaney accusing Warren of making “fairytale” promises – Sanders shot back: “I get a little tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas.”On many of the other issues, the 10 candidates were broadly in agreement. A discussion on immigration saw most criticise President Donald Trump’s border policy on gun violence, most advocated for stronger gun control and background checks, although Bernie Sanders came in for criticism for his past stance on gun ownership, which has seen the Vermont senator vote against national background checks. Virtually all candidates promised to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan if elected.The recent racial tensions that have been stoked by Trump were also a topic of debate among the all-white candidate line-up. Former Texan congressman Beto O’Rourke said he would sign a new voting rights act if he was elected president, while Marianne Williamson said she supported reparations for the descendants of slaves – an increasingly controversial issue. The self-help author’s suggestion elicited one of the biggest cheers of the night. Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota who is running on a centrist platform, said it was important to note that not all Trump supporters were racist, though she said the president’s recent comments about Baltimore and members of Congress could not be tolerated.Trade policyOn trade, many of the Democrats in the debate criticised the current system, with many echoing Donald Trump’s policy. The US president was “on to something when he talked about China”, said Tim Ryan from Ohio, a member of the House of Representatives.Elizabeth Warren also outlined her opposition to the current global trading system, arguing that trade deals had become “a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so that they can suck more profits out for themselves and leave the American people behind”.“Elizabeth is absolutely right,” Bernie Sanders said, adding that he was the only member of Congress to vote against the original Nafta trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Overall the debate yielded few surprises. None of the candidates had a standout moment, and moderates such as O’Rourke and Klobuchar are likely to be disappointed that they did not make up much ground. In a sign of the relative blandness of the evening, self-help guru Williamson, who is polling at less than 1 per cent, was one of the hits of the night. She was the top-searched topic on Google in 49 out of the 50 US states during the debate.As with the previous debate in Miami, Wednesday’s debate is likely to be the more exciting of the two.A rematch between Senator Kamala Harris and former vice president Joe Biden is on the cards after a clash between the two became the defining moment of last month’s debates.Fr many candidates this will be the last opportunity to make their mark on the national stage. Eligibility requirements for the third debate in Houston in September are much tighter, when the line-up will be reduced to as few as 10.Meanwhile, the millions of Democratic viewers tuning in to the debates this week will be hoping that this week brings the party closer to choosing the best candidate to take on Donald Trump next year.Read more about the Donald Trump

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms.

They said they were subject to repeated political indoctrination and often did not understand why they were being held in the facilities.Travelling abroad, speaking to relatives in other countries and growing a long beard are all acts that might land someone in detention, according to Uighurs and Kazakhs who have fled the region.Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang’s Uighur governor, declined at a news briefing to give a figure for those he described as students inside the centres. He defended the facilities as an effective and pioneering approach to counterterrorism.Uighurs and Kazakhs outside China, however, continue to appeal to foreign governments to help them locate their relatives still inside Xinjiang. Many say they have not been able to contact their loved ones for years, and they fear the worst.Shohrat Zakir, chairman of China\u0026#39s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, speaks during a press conference at the State Council Information Office in BeijingSome told the AP that some detainees were released from the camps only to be forced into factory jobs. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign, according to one detainee who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.Xinjiang Vice Chairman Alken Tuniaz said accounts of mistreatment in the camps were concocted by a few countries and media outlets.The centres protected people’s liberties by allowing them to request time off and regularly go home, Tuniaz said. While the people inside the centers are not permitted to practice their religion during their period of study, they can resume activities related to their faith when they are at home. The officials at Tuesday’s briefing did not address whether the program is voluntary or how often people are allowed to go home.After international condemnation of and extensive reporting on the centres, China began organising highly choreographed trips to Xinjiang for journalists and foreign officials. Earlier this month, United Nations envoys from 37 countries, including North Korea, Syria and several Muslim-majority states, signed a letter supporting the camps and commending China’s human rights record. The letter was an apparent response to a letter signed by 22 countries - including Germany, Japan and the UK - condemning the camps.Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, called Zakir a political microphone used by Beijing to spread its deception.Shohrat Zakir’s remarks completely distort the reality of the systematic persecution that Uighurs are suffering in China, Raxit said.The US State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator, Nathan Sales, said in an interview in July with the US government-funded Radio Free Asia that the detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang had nothing to do with terrorism and was instead part of the Communist Party’s war on religion.It is trying to stamp out the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identities of the people that it’s been targeting, Sales told RFA.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

If those words make you think of nature and birdsong, you are one of a dying breed.New research has found that the language of the natural world is being lost or overtaken by references to technology.Comparative analysis of conversation in the 1990s and the current decade showed that nature-related definitions have fallen dramatically.Modern usage of the word ‘tweet’ now refers to social media rather than birdsong in 99 per cent of cases.In the 1990s, a stream was a small river and a net was something you used to catch things. Now, those definitions have fallen to 36 per cent and 63 per cent respectively - a stream is how your audio and video are played online, and ‘the net’ is the internet.Nature usage of the word ‘web’ has fallen from 71 per cent in the 1990s to seven per cent now. And while 100 per cent of references to a ‘cloud’ in the 1990s were about the sky, the figure has fallen to 77 per cent as the remaining 23 per cent think of it as a place to store online data.Nature words that are falling out of useResearchers at the University of Leeds used two bodies of transcribed, informal conversations among members of the public, comprising five million words in the 1990s and 12 million words in the 2010s.In the earlier conversations, 100 per cent of references to a ‘field’ concerned grass or farmland. That has fallen to 70 per cent, with modern conversation taking in the metaphorical fields of work, gravity or energy.Researchers also found that the following nature words have decreased in relative frequency among young people between the 1990s and 2010s: lawn, twig, blackbird, picnic, fishing, paddle, sand, welly, desert, paw, snow, grass, jungle, sky, path, bridge, bush, land, hill, fish, pond, mountain, soil, branch, stick, park, ground, wheel, tree, stream, rock, bird, road, garden, shell.The study was commissioned by the National Trust to mark the launch of its 50 Things To Do Before You’re 11¾ initiative, which lists free activities including cloud watching and observing a sunrise or sunset.Andy Beer, the organisation’s regional director for the Midlands, said: “As a nation we are losing our connection with nature. This is really worrying for us as a conservation charity.“One of the key reasons we were formed was to protect and look after green spaces and wildlife for the benefit of the nation. If today’s children aren’t connected to nature, then who is going to stand up for our countryside and wildlife in the future?”Dr Robbie Love, a linguistics fellow who conducted part of the study, said: “Language represents what’s important to a culture or society. Nature language being replaced or used less frequently suggests nature potentially becoming less important or being replaced by other things.”Sinn Fein leader warns Boris Johnson \u0026#39you must not wreck Ireland\u0026#39 in process of delivering Brexit as PM makes first visitWould you go on a British Airways slow \u0026#39air cruise\u0026#39?Comment: Here\u0026#39s why we will not just survive a no-deal Brexit, but thriveUK weather: Bridge collapses and roads washed away as flood warnings continue to midnightTooting explosion: At least three injured after gas leak blows wall out of block of flatsSex, drugs and wobbly cameras: how This Life reinvented British TVComment: Britain cannot shirk the fight against rogue statesSecond Democratic debate: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren attacked over \u0026#39wish-list economics\u0026#39China claims most people in Xinjiang camps reintegrated to societyChief vet warns tourists not to bring salami and ham home as deadly swine virus stalks EuropeWhy is A$AP Rocky\u0026#39s trial in Sweden getting so much attention?North Korea fires two short-range ballistic missiles in bid to stop drillsHong Kong protesters clash with police as 44 activists charged with riotingStopping statins treatment in old age increases heart attack risk by nearly half, major study warnsBritain seeks to unite Europeans over Iran\u0026#39s threat to shipping in Strait of HormuzEngland\u0026#39s medieval sport of jousting will introduce hawk-eye technologyInvest billions to restore pride in overlooked communities after Brexit and reap \u0026#39electoral idends\u0026#39, Joseph Rowntree Foundation tells BorisHottest 10 years in Britain since records began have all occurred since 2002, Met Office confirms We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/20/TELEMMGLPICT000204318467_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbFS4ctvTRCv11iMWUZHtVtASqlMKLNH6jX4V1ARTZEE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"isaap rockys trial sweden getting much attention","story":"ASAP Rocky was arrested in Sweden after a June 30 altercation in StockholmAmerican rapper A$AP Rocky went on trial in Sweden on Tuesday, with an unusual observer in the courtroom – President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs.Robert O’Brien, a partner in a Los Angeles law firm who has for decades been deeply involved in diplomacy in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he was there at the request of Mr Trump.“The president asked me to come here and support these American citizens,” he said.“I’ll be here until they come home.”Mr O’Brien’s presence is yet another strange element in this strange case, which has become an international rallying call – pitting the United States against an unusual enemy, Sweden.Mr Trump has said he is “very disappointed” in his Swedish counterpart.“Treat Americans fairly!” he urged.The 30-year-old was born in the New York City district of Harlem to a father from Barbados and an African-American mother.ASAP Rocky at Coachella in April 2016His childhood was tough: the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was 12 when his father was sent to prison for drug-related offences the next year his elder brother was killed in a gun attack. Mayers and his mother slept in homeless shelters in the Bronx.Mayers began a collective with other Harlem rappers, known as the ASAP Mob.In 2011 he released his first mix tape, which caught the attention of Sony Music Entertainment – in October of that year he signed a $3 million record deal.Soon he was on tour with Kendrick Lamar as the opening act for Drake, appearing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, collaborating with Rihanna, Rod Stewart, Lana del Ray, Selena Gomez and Alicia Keys.His eye-catching style and love of flamboyant clothes led to deals with Guess, front row seats at Gucci and Dior shows, and even a song dedicated to former Calvin Klein designer Raf Simons.ASAP Rocky, front row at Gucci\u0026#39s AutumnWinter 2017 show, in Milan in February 2017Mayers is accused of assaulting Mustafa Jafari, a 19-year-old Afghan immigrant, on June 30 while the rapper was in the city to perform at a music festival.Mayers, along with his co-defendants, Bladimir Emilio Corniel and David Tyrone Rispers, all pleaded not guilty on Tuesday.Mayers posted partial footage of the incident on his Instagram page.In it, Mr Jafari is seen confronting Mayers’ bodyguard, accusing him of having broken his headphones. He repeatedly, in broken English, asks for his headphones back.Mr Jafari told police he had become separated from a friend when he crossed paths with Mayers and his entourage, and asked if they had seen his friend.The teenager said Mayers’ bodyguard, who is named only as Tee in court papers, and has not been charged, told him to go away, then pushed him. He said the bodyguard grabbed him by the throat, lifted him off the ground and carried him away from the group, breaking his headphones.Mr Jafari said he threw the broken headphones at the security guard, then followed the group around, complaining about his broken headphones. He didn’t know who A$AP Rocky was, he added.ASAP Rocky on stage in London in October 2015Slobodan Jovicic, Mayers’ lawyer, said in court on Tuesday that Mr Jafari broke the headphones himself when he tried to punch the bodyguard.Mr Jafari said he followed the group and his entourage onto a side street and tried to talk to them again about the broken headphones.In the Instagram video, Mayers is heard repeatedly telling the teenager to walk away and leave them alone.Just for the cameras, we don\u0027t want no problem with these boys,” Mayers said. “They keep following us, look at them.”Someone in Mayers’ group says to Mr Jafari: “Yo, stop following me, man.”The teenager replies: “You fight with me. My headphones. Give me my headphones.”A voice replies: “Yo bro, go somewhere, bro. Just go that way.”Mr Jafari alleges that, once the Instagram clip ended, he was attacked with a glass bottle by someone in Mayers’ group.“While I’m talking to them, all of a sudden one of these guys comes from behind and hits me with a bottle,” smashing it on the right side of the head behind his ear, Mr Jafari said.He did not know which man hit him with the bottle, he said.Mr Jafari said that once he was down on the ground, he was kicked and punched repeatedly, at least 20 times by all four men in the group.“I felt they were going to beat me to death,” he said.The case immediately gained celebrity attention, with the hashtag #FreeRocky trending on Twitter.Mr Trump was reportedly told about the case by Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian West, who has become one of the most influential advocates for prison reform.Some have suggested that Mayers’ incident was racially-motivated.Mr Trump has posted a string of tweets in the last two weeks in which he referenced the #FreeRocky hashtag and said that Sweden had “let our African-American community down.”Stefan Lofven, Sweden’s prime minister, spoke to Mr Trump on July 20, and, according to the Swedish leader, told the president that “in Sweden everyone is equal before the law and that the government cannot and will not attempt to influence the legal proceedings.”Sweden’s legal system differs from the US in that bail is uncommon - most people accused of crimes carrying a sentence of a year or more are held before trial, often in isolation.There is no plea bargaining, and no trial by jury: instead unelected judges and prosecutors, qualified not by votes but by education and training, decide a case.Mr Trump insists, however, that Mayers is being treated unfairly.On July 25 he tweeted: “Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan Lofven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky, and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRocky”Mayers will not testify until the trial resumes on Thursday.According to a transcript of his police interview, he said that Mr Jafari and another man had been harassing and following him and that he feared he was about to be attacked.ASAP Rocky front row at a Gucci show in Milan in 2017Magnus Stromberg, Mr Jafari’s lawyer, said his client was asking for about $16,000 in compensation for injuries and lost income. He said that Mr Jafari suffered cuts to his face, arms and hands that required 13 stitches and would leave scars. Some wounds appeared to come from a broken bottle found at the scene, he added.Mayers could also face a prison sentence.Leif Silbersky, a Swedish lawyer, told The New York Times that the bottle was key to the case.“If someone has used a glass bottle, then it’s an aggravating circumstance, and it automatically carries a prison sentence” of at least a year, he said.Sinn Fein leader warns Boris

Only Npower, with 30 per cent, scored lower among the UK’s six largest energy suppliers.In February, British Gas blamed the government’s energy price cap as it warned that profits would be lower than forecast.Under the cap, Ofgem sets an upper limit for the annual cost of gas and electricity on so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs).SVTs are often the default deal that companies switch customers onto after their initial tariff period comes to an end. However they are also among the most expensive deals available, prompting accusations from consumer groups that loyal customers are being exploited.“Centrica’s calamitous financial results come as no surprise to GMB and the announcement to cut another £250m and slash yet more jobs is not the answer – you cannot just cut your way out of crisis.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the roll-out of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full roll-out of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.The cap will also be re-set based on more up-to-date and detailed data than what was available to the CMA in 2016. As a result, the cap will be increased from 1 October, with prepayment customers paying roughly £1 a week more based on current prices.“A price cap set too low may lead to suppliers leaving the market, reducing both competition and consumer choice. Even with revised level of the price cap, prepayment customers will still be protected from unnecessarily high prices,” the CMA said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both also look set to become the most successful entries in the Disney remake canon.Created with Sketch. Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist.

Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, released in early 2010, kicked off the Disney remake boom, with successive hits including the Emma Watson-lead Beauty and the Beast, Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book and the Sleeping Beauty origin story Maleficent. Only Burton’s Dumbo, released in March, along with his 2016 Alice in Wonderland sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass, have underperformed.Lion King set to hit $1bn at global box officeThe first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan is hereThe original Little Mermaid has spoken on reboot casting backlashForbes has also reported that Disney’s remake success has contributed to their best-ever year at the global box office, with the company already grossing an enormous $7.6 billion thanks to smashes like Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel and Toy Story 4. This will inevitably increase, too, with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2\u0026nbspboth awaiting release before the end of 2019.Disney shows no signs of slowing down on the remake front either, with both the Maleficent sequel Mistress of Evil arriving in October, and a live-action remake of Mulan released in 2020. Cruella, an origin story for the 101 Dalmatians villainess starring Emma Stone, will additionally soon begin filming, as will a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid starring Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy and (allegedly) Harry Styles.Alice through the Looking Glass\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBeauty and the Beast\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the roll-out of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full roll-out of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.The cap will also be re-set based on more up-to-date and detailed data than what was available to the CMA in 2016. As a result, the cap will be increased from 1 October, with prepayment customers paying roughly £1 a week more based on current prices.“A price cap set too low may lead to suppliers leaving the market, reducing both competition and consumer choice. Even with revised level of the price cap, prepayment customers will still be protected from unnecessarily high prices,” the CMA said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018That\u0027s why it\u0027s important that devices like iPhones shut down when they detect they have gone over their temperature. But that does not stop it being any more frustrating when it does.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakWhen phones do shut down, they will show an error message that tells their user that the phone won\u0027t work until it has cooled down again.iPhones are made\u0026nbspto operate between zero and 35-degrees Celsius. That measure refers to the temperature around the phone, however, rather than the phone itself – meaning that they may shut down more quickly even if the ambient temperature is lower, and might not do so immediately even when the weather is a little hotter.If a phone is left out in the sun, for instance, it will get warm much more quickly and might shut down. And by the same measure, if it is able to cool in a hot room by being left out on a cold surface, it might be able to keep running even when the outside temperature would appear to be too hot.The phones can also be stored in places that are up to 45-degrees celsius, according to Apple. But they can\u0027t be\u0026nbspused\u0026nbspat that temperature, only kept there.Cooling a phone down to make it start working again can be done just like any other object: put it somewhere cool, move it out of direct sunlight, and in extreme cases you can hold it next to something cold like a bottle of water. It can also be useful to take it out of its case, since they can store up the heat and work like a blanket wrapped around it.But it can also be helpful to stop it getting that warm in the first place. That can be done by keeping it out of direct heat, but also minimising the amount of work it is doing on the inside – avoiding intensive processes like playing games, downloading files, and other taxing activities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Previous studies had suggested that it formed about 150 million years after the solar system.The discovery could also help us understand just how old our own Earth is.The new research is published almost exactly 50 years since humanity walked on the Moon for the first ever time. As astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz\u0026nbspAldrin\u0026nbspdid so, they gathered up vast collections of samples, so they could be used to understand not only the history of the Moon but also of our Earth and the other planets that surround us.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

That threw out material into Earth\u0027s orbit, which gradually formed into the Moon we can see today.But in its early state, it looked very different, covered in an ocean of magma that formed different kinds of rock as it cooled and became solid. Researchers can therefore look at the nature of those rocks in an attempt to understand how the Moon was formed, by examining the chemical makeup of the samples.We are missing an opportunity to change way we think about the moonSuch observations are not possible on Earth anymore, as our planet has been geologically active over time, said\u0026nbspPeter Sprung, co-author of the ne study.\u0026nbspThe Moon thus provides a unique opportunity to study planetary evolution.The researchers were able to look at the variety of different rare elements that could be found in the lunar samples, to help them see how much melting had to happen to make the patterns that are visible on the surface today. The researchers then looked for trends and patterns among those rocks, helping them understand how those rare elements behave.Two of those rare materials –\u0026nbsphafnium and tungsten – are useful because they work as something of a natural clock: they decay reliably, so can be used to track time. That decay only lasted for the first 70 million years of the solar system, and helped show that the Moon had already started to solidify as soon as 50 million years after the solar system began.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That movement in turn creates a magnetic field around the Sun, but far enough away the pull of that magnetic field is weak and plasma breaks off the Sun and flies through the solar system.Nasa discovers planet unlike any ever seen in our solar systemThe researchers aren\u0027t able to directly see that happening. But they created another, much smaller ball of plasma – in a lab, and named the Big Red Ball.The solar wind is highly variable, but there are essentially two types: fast and slow, explains Ethan Peterson, a graduate student in the department of physics at UW-Madison and lead author of the study. Satellite missions have documented pretty well where the fast wind comes from, so we were trying to study specifically how the slow solar wind is generated and how it evolves as it travels toward Earth.The Big Red Ball is a sphere that has a magnet in its middle. Gas is pumped into it and made into a plasma, which can then be hit with an electric current that makes it behave like the Sun.The researchers can then study that small version of the star from various points, giving them a three-dimensional picture of what that activity looks like.It allowed them to watch small versions of the spirals and burps that are thrown out of the Sun. Researchers already knew that it threw out plasma periodically from satellite images – but the new researchers were able to learn more.These ejections are observed by satellites, but no one knows what drives them, Peterson says. We ended up seeing very similar burps in our experiment, and identified how they develop.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The initial public offering raised $16 billion – the third largest in US history915 Gobbling up the competitionFacebook acquired Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, consolidating its position as the world\u0027s leading social networkOn 4 October, 2012, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had hit 1 billion users. \u0027If you’re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honour of serving you,\u0027 he wrote in a blog post1115 Expanding its empireIn February 2014 Facebook acquired the messaging app WhatsApp for $19.3 billionIn June 2017, Facebook passed the 2 billion user milestoneOn 17 March 2018, news broke that UK firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from around 87 million Facebook users for the purpose of political profiling in the build up to the 2016 US presidential electionsDespite the scandals and subsequent #DeleteFacebook campaign, Facebook posted record profits just before its 15th anniversary, the equivalent of $7.37 from each of its 2.32 billions usersA study found that people are happier when they don’t use Facebook, adding to mounting evidence surrounding the impact social media has on mental healthFacebook is considering using end-to-end encryption on Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct.Writing in The , Ms Patel called for tech companies to provide a “back door” into such messaging apps, which could be used by law enforcement organisations to tackle crime.“This is not an abstract debate: Facebook’s recently announced plan to apply end-to-end encryption across its messaging platforms presents significant challenges which we must work collaboratively to address,” she said.“The use of end-to-end encryption in this way has the potential to have serious consequences for the vital work which companies already undertake to identify and remove child abuse and terrorist content.”“It will also hamper our own law enforcement agencies, and those of our allies, in their ability to identify and stop criminals abusing children, trafficking drugs, weapons and people, or terrorists plotting attacks.”WhatsApp change could allow others to read your messagesTech giants bringing regulation on themselves, police watchdog claimsUK government secretly plans to spy on thousands of people at a timeWhatsApp encryption: What is it and why is the government so worried?How to stop Facebook from being able to read all your messagesMs Patel’s comments do not mark the first time in recent years a home secretary has attempted to force phone apps into handing over encrypted messages.In 2017, Amber Rudd came under fire after calling for laws to build back doors into end-to-end encrypted messaging services as a crime-fighting tool.The plans were met with criticism at the time from Robert\u0026nbspHannigan, a former head of\u0026nbspGCHQ, who claimed they would amount to “weakening security for everybody to tackle a minority”.“Encryption is an overwhelmingly good thing – it keeps us all safe and secure,” he added.In a joint communique released at the end of the summit, the Five Eyes countries\u0026nbspsaid: “Tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal authority, can obtain access to data in a readable and usable format.”US attorney general William Barr said: “Throughout this week, we have had substantive, frank and positive discussions surrounding our shared duty to protect public safety, including those related to the internet.“Encryption presents a unique challenge. We must ensure that we do not stand by as advances in technology create spaces where criminal activity of the most heinous kind can go undetected and unpunished.“Indeed, making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world.”Industry representatives – including executives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter – agreed to collaborate with member states on a set of voluntary principles to combat child exploitation, including the live streaming of abuse.The principles are due to be finalised by the end of September.Meanwhile, a set of five commitments for the Five Eyes states were agreed by ministers.They included sharing learning on cyber threats, ensuring security in 5G networks and creating a stronger approach to the misuse of drones.They also committed to exploring enhanced cross-border information-sharing and to maintain efforts to combat foreign interference in elections.Additional reporting by PAThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

This goes well beyond Yemen’\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentTens of millions of people could lose access to clean drinking water if a decaying oil tanker moored off the coast of Yemen is left to collapse or explode, experts have said.The Yemeni state-owned vessel Safer, which holds over one million barrels of crude oil, is stationed permanently around five\u0026nbspnautical miles off the rebel-held port of Ras Isa.Since the late\u0026nbsp1980s, it has served as an offshore oil storage platform, and is directly connected to a\u0026nbspnearby pipeline in the\u0026nbspcentral Yemeni province of Marib. But since war erupted in Yemen in 2014, few maintenance crews have been given access to the 43-year-old ship. Last week, the United Nations said the Houthis\u0026nbsphad once again barred experts from assessing the vessel.Experts now fear that\u0026nbspthe buildup of volatile gasses released by the oil could cause a huge explosion, or the corrosion to the vessel\u0026nbspcould see it completely disintegrate – both\u0026nbspleading to one of the world’s largest oil spills.\u0026nbspYemen’s recognised authorities told The Independent they had submitted multiple urgent appeals to the UN to pile pressure on the Iran-backed rebels.In a new evaluation of the impact of such a disaster, experts at IR\u0026nbspConsilium – a consultancy focusing on maritime law and security – warned that any such incident would force multiple desalination plants across the surrounding Red Sea area to shut, depriving millions of access to drinking water.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Food aid for Yemenis stolen Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People walk in a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.People stand near their rooms inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.A baby sleeps inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.A woman sits with her baby inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.Sisters play in their room at a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.The entrance of the hangar of the United Nations in Aden, Yemen, in this 23 July 2018 photo.A man sells aid supplies at a market in Aden, Yemen, in this 23 July 2018 photo.The entrance to the port where aid is received, in Aden, Yemen, is shown in this 23 July 2018 photo.This 24 July 2018 photo shows a gas station on a road in Shabwah, Yemen.

The Atlantic Council lists the UAE\u0026nbspembassy in the US and the British Foreign Office among its major donors.Mohammed al-Hadhrami, vice minister of foreign affairs for the recognised Yemen government, said the authorities were making urgent appeals to the UN and other international bodies.\u0026nbsp“If something happens to the tanker it would be a problem for the whole region –\u0026nbspeven the world,” ambassador al-Hadhrami told The Independent, calling it “an ethical obligation for the UN” to act.“We don’t want to see it get that far. No one knows the full potential of the spill, if it happens it would set a precedent in the region. This goes well beyond Yemen,” he added.The Houthis could not be immediately reached for comment.There are quite a few plants\u0026nbspand having one or more shut down due to contamination from an oil spill could have dire consequences for the region’s people, millions of whom are already on the brinkBefore the conflict, the tanker had acted as a\u0026nbspstorage facility\u0026nbspfor the main Marib-Ras Isa pipeline in Yemen, which\u0026nbsphas no onshore facilities in the area.The ship now lies along a part of coast controlled by the Iran-backed Houthis, who want guarantees that they will have access to the revenues of the oil, thought to be worth $80m (£65m).The cash-strapped rebels swept control of the country in late 2014, forcing the recognised Yemeni president Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi to flee.Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies launched a bombing campaign in the spring of 2015 to reinstate their ally Mr Hadi.\u0026nbspFour years on there is little hope of an end to the fighting.The tanker is so contentious that\u0026nbspit was named in a\u0026nbsppeace agreement signed by both the Houthis and the Saudi-backed recognised government in Stockholm last year, involving withdrawals from key Red Sea ports.But so far peace talks have stalled and the last time a maintenance crew was given access to the tanker was two years ago.UAE confirms pull back in Yemen war but won’t withdraw completelyGovernment bids to resurrect ‘unlawful’ arms sales to Saudi ArabiaYemen cholera outbreak hits over 200,000 children in 2019 Corbyn condemns May after meeting with ‘war ally’ Saudi princeBAE denies it has any responsibility to investigate Yemen atrocitiesIR\u0026nbspConsilium said that earlier this year the vessel was so corroded that a piece of it fell off – fortunately missing the submarine pipeline that feeds it.The pipeline may contain another one million barrels of oil, which could also be dumped into the Red Sea if the vessel collapses, doubling the size of the oil spill.\u0026nbspAt least in terms of numbers of barrels, it is akin to when Saddam Hussein dumped millions of barrels in the Persian Gulf in 1991.\u0026nbspNo one knows the full potential of the spill, if it happens it would set a precedent in the region. This goes well beyond YemenHe compared the devastation to a recent diesel spill off the coast of Patagonia which made international headlines despite only involving 250 barrels of fuel.“If the Safer were to leak all its oil, the spill would be over four and a half thousand times larger – and that’s the Safer alone, not the submarine pipeline that connects with it,” he said.Dr Ian Ralby who also worked on the report said that despite the alarming potential consequences of the spill, the crisis “has not inspired sufficient action”.He warned of the violence that would likely ensue from lack of access to drinking water, as well as the effect of the spill “global marine bioersity, the loss of livelihoods and food sources from the degraded marine environment, and the threat to coastal tourism”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to Wired, hed drop acid in the morning before heading off to work.On one harrowing occasion, McAfee snorted an entire bag of a psychedelic powder called DMT. He was found hiding behind a rubbish bin, convinced he could hear voices.Over the next few years, his drug habit escalated, and McAfee found himself doing lines of cocaine at work most days.Unsurprisingly, things eventually came to a head in the early s when his we left him and he was sacked.Contemplating taking his own le like his dad, McAfee finally sought the help he needed to get sober and landed a job as a software engineer for defence contractor Lockheed Martin.While there, he came across the first-known computer virus. He tried to crack it himself - with his success propelling him towards fame and fortune.By , McAfee had established himself as the worlds leading antivirus expert and founded McAfee Associates, with his antivirus product becoming an instant hit. Seven years later, he sold his stake to Intel, netting around £million.With his fortune, McAfee splashed out on properties in Hawaii, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, as well as antique cars and a fleet of planes.In a particularly eccentric move, he also set up a sex yoga ashram school.But after the economic collapse in , bad boy McAfee auctioned off all his belongings, and moved to the Central American jungle, where he bought a villa in picturesque Belize.Desperate to keep old age at bay, the increasingly wacky tycoon would allegedly inject testosterone into his bum every other week.He was also joined in the country by a harem of seven much younger women.“Some people think it is horrendous that I lived with seven women aged between  and ,” McAfee would later tell The Sun. “People can think what they want. The women all got along.He also bizarrely revealed one of his lovers, a teen called Amy, had tried to shoot him.She tried to kill me when we first met, although we got over that, he said.Despite his playboy antics, McAfee never went on porn sites in case he got a virus.I just dont go there, he once told the BBC.During his time in Belize, the businessman started up an antibiotics company and began posting on drug-taking message boards about attempts to pury the compounds within bath salts, Gizmodo reports.However, he began to get paranoid he was being watched, and his business venture turned to ruin when local cops raided his company lab in search of evidence of drug-making.They found a cache of weapons and £, in cash, but no illegal drugs.According to McAfee, the raid marked the beginning of a conspiracy to destroy him - something he believes was revenge for his refusal to be extorted by the Belizean government.He even claimed the authorities were trying to kill him. Belizes Prime Minister Dean Barrow has dismissed McAfees allegations, labelling him “extremely paranoid, even bonkers”, news.au reports.In , McAfee was deemed a person of interest by the nations police - something he remains to be - when his neighbour Gregory Faull was discovered shot dead in a pool of blood.Officers called by McAfees home, but there was no sight of him.The tycoon, who has admitted American Mr Faull was not my favourite person but has denied any involvement in his death, would later claim he buried himself in sand to evade police.He fled Belize, but was arrested in Guatemala in December .He was charged with illegally entering the country, but faked a heart attack to buy some time so his lawyer could stop him being deported back to Belize.The plan seemingly worked - days later, McAfee was sent to the US.Shortly after, McAfee met we Janice, , in Miami Beach, Florida, when he hired her as a prostitute with money loaned to him by a friend, and the pair tied the knot in .But the drama wasnt over yet.The same year, McAfee uploaded a parody video, How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus, showing him criticising McAfee software while snorting powder and surrounded by women.And three years later, he was at the centre of another scandal when the Showtime documentary, Gringo: The dangerous le of John McAfee, was released.It alleged he drugged and raped a former business partner, and committed murder - accusations McAfee has vehemently denied.McAfee was then served with a subpoena by the US Securities and Exchange Commission , reported to be related to his involvement in cyber-currencies. He told Reuters he did not pay income tax for eight years for ideological reasons and was indicted.The following year, McAfee and his we revealed they were living in a Tennessee compound with a   armed bodyguard, claiming they had been followed for the past four years.The same year, McAfee claimed he had been targeted in a poisoning assassination attempt, posting images on Twitter purportedly showing him on le support in hospital.I am more dficult to kill than anyone can possibly imagine, he wrote.Earlier this year, McAfee left his heavily-fortied compound and took off on a yacht to avoid trial, along with Janice, their four large dogs, two security staff and seven staff.The tycoon - who has previously claimed hes fathered  kids - left the States for the Bahamas, then Cuba, after suspecting US law enforcement were trying to extradite him.But last week, the businessman was detained with Janice and his crew in the Dominican Republic - just days after claiming on Twitter that the CIA had tried to collect him.His Twitter feed was taken over by a friend, who warnedJohn misses his next check-in, events will be set into motion - another sign of just how paranoid the tech whizz is.McAfee and his crew were detained for four days, before initially being released on July . But the day after, McAfee claimed to have been arrested for the second time in a week.He shared photos of himself on Twitter, with his arms around his captors - along with the bare-chested image of him in a cell, which Janice deemed her favourite.He claimed he had smuggled a phone into the jail by sleight of hand, adding: If my hands were bigger I could have smuggled a Bangkok prostitute in with me.Soon after, McAfee revealed he and Janice had landed in London, with pictures purportedly showing the pair visiting a restaurant and in a hotel room with some guards.The bad guys never came close, the tycoon tweeted.Now, McAfee has fled once more, to the secret, fortied facility in Lithuania - after claiming the long arm of the US was trying to get him in Britain.And while its unclear exactly where this facility is, one thing is for certain - McAfee will never stop looking over his shoulder for the next attacker.There is an underground network of corrupt national officials that is used by the CIA for nefarious purposes, he claims.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of . Rutger gave one of cinema’s greatest  performances as the android Roy in  Ridley Scott’s  masterpiece, Blade Runner. Despite looking like Billy Idol’s butch big brother.THERE is an allegedly “popcorn-dropping moment” at the start of the next James Bond film when – after Bond retires – a senior spook says: “Come in, .”And Lashana Lynch – black, beautul and female – walks into the room.But is this really such a shocker In the increasingly “woke” world of Bond, it would have been far more surprisingthe new  was revealed to be a middle-aged white bloke with a pack of Viagra in his tuxedo.The Bond films now forbid the term “Bond girls” being used on set. Daniel Craig calls  a “misogynist”.Bond is certainly promiscuous, reluctant to commit and possibly a sex addict. But suggesting he hates women is just stupid.Everyone involved with Bond  – the next film – seems acutely embarrassed about associating with the sexist old dinosaur.Naomie Harris – so brilliant as the new incarnation of Miss Moneypenny – says: “The Bond of old, his days are numbered.”Why so defensive  The greatest James Bond film of all time – Skyfall, directed by Sam Mendes – showed a  who was being overtaken by time, his bones creaking, his body aching and his shooting skills not what they once were.But Mendes did not have the craven virtue-signalling, political correctness that currently infests the James Bond franchise.For more than half a century, millions have looked to  for iconic thrills, spills and entertainment.

He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Russians could and should have been more transparent.“Not because we want to blame them its not about pointing and making fun of them, we want to learn the lessons of this release.Rosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, rejected Steinhauser’s findings.In a statement, the organisation said:  “We maintain that there have been no reportable events at any Rosatom-operated plants or facilities.Both the national regulator and experts from an independent international inquiry inspected the Mayak facility back in  and found nothing to suggest that the ruthenium- isotope originated from this site, nor found any traces of an alleged accident, nor found any evidence of local staff exposure to elevated levels of radioactivity.The recent PNAS report does not contain any new data or facts that dfer from the data previously used by the national regulator and the independent international inquiry which reviewed all the scenarios, including that of an alleged accidental leak on the Mayak facility.The independent international inquiry has found the accidental release scenario to be inconsistent with the established facts.Had an accidental release of the alleged magnitudetaken place, the facilitys automated control and monitoring systems would have recorded radioactivity thousands of times higher than what was actually recorded.Such levels would have triggered alarms at the plant to evacuate staff and residents from the surrounding area.If staff had been exposed to this much radiation, the ruthenium- would have been detectable.However,  of the Mayak site employees, including those working in its radiochemistry plant, were checked by an independent lab and none of them were found to have any traces of excess exposure.Contrary to a speculative theory in the PNAS report, the cerium- project activities conducted at the Mayak facility from August to November  were related only to rare-earth concentrate which would only contain barely detectable traces of ruthenium- isotope.”The studys full findings can found in journal PNAS."},{"url":null,"title":"mum premature baby 13 ounce","story":"Ellonn Smartt, , from Des Moines, Iowa, was rushed to hospital for an emergency C-section after her waters broke.Speaking to Today, Ellonn said: They said I was going to have to deliver in the next day or two and there was a good chance he wouldn’t survive.That was the moment when I fell apart.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were welcoming the Prime Minister to Northern Ireland, she told Good Morning Britain.But the dinner will likely have involved speculative discussions on the price of the DUPs continued support of the Tory party.The DUP said their agreement was still on the cards as they did a deal with the party, not the leader of it.But in the coming months they are set to demand more concessions infor their backing - and they will be fighting to rip up the backstop too like Boris.The PM will use his first trip to Northern Ireland to call for theof a power-sharing government.Its currently been suspended for more than two years after relations between the two parties broke down.He said this morning: Its great to be here in Northern Ireland.I’ll be helping the parties in any way I can to get that going and over the line...And he added: I expect Brexit may come up a little bit!

Mr Johnson rushed to Wales ahead of the Brecon and Radnorshire election in a last-minute bid to see off defeat.  But Mr Johnson’s No Deal threats could hand this Leave voting seat to the Lib Dems. Across rural Wales Mr Johnson faces a brutal backlash to his reckless approach to Europe, with Farmers’ Union of Wales warning of “civil unrest” following a No Deal Brexit . Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds is predicted to with the seat Thursday, winning back a constituency the partly lost in its near wipe-our results in . The party have ditched the brash “Bollocks to Brexit” slogan from their European election resurgence - but the campaign is still dominated by Europe.Labour , who came a distant third in the seat in  have seen their vote squeezed by the Lib Dem insurgency - with senior party officials worried they could lose their deposit.    Mr Johnson’s last-minute visit was hoped to inject some energy into a nearly invisible Conservative campaign.

A poll by Number Cruncher Politics says the Lib Dems will take the seat. It puts the Lib Dems ahead of the Tories and Brexit Party in third. The Tories would drop % of the vote, according to the poll.    Who is standing  Conservative Party Odds of winning -    Disagraced ex-MP Chris Davies, , who admitted falsying documents on his expenses. Davies conviction for expenses fraud led to the recall petition that triggered the byelection.

Clearly the authorities have been through my accounts and everything Iaposve done with a fine-tooth comb over the last four years, and that was the only mistake they could find, he added.

He added: After a decade of cuts people are struggling. “I met a woman working five jobs just to get by. “And the Tories and Lib Dems don’t have the answers.” Despite a tough campaign, which could see the party pushed into fourth by the Brexit Party, Mr Davies has said there was clearly an appetite for Labour in Brecon and Radnorshire and a socialist option on the ballot. It is a four-way split andenough people donapost just vote to keep the Tories out but for what we want then we could wind this.    Liberal Democrats Odds of winning -    Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds, , is a child-protection social worker.

The US has already banned Huawei from providing kit for their G rollout, over fears their close links to the Chinese government could pose a security risk.    While not mentioning Huawei by name, the group discussed the risks of “unauthorised access or interference” in new G networks, including by “foreign governments.” The group agreed to perform an “evidence-based risk assessment” on the issue.The meeting of security ministers from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance is Ms Patel’s first major act as Boris Johnson ’s Home Secretary.The Five Eyes, which includes Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - evolved from a secret World War Two alliance between British and U.S. code breakers.    Ms Patel said: “The Five Eyes are united that tech firms should not develop their systems and services, including end-to-end encryption, in ways that empower criminals or put vulnerable people at risk. “We heard today about the devastating and lelong impact of child sexual exploitation and abuse and agreed firm commitments to collaborate to get ahead of the threat. “As Governments, protecting our citizens is our top priority, which is why through the unique and binding partnership of Five Eyes we will tackle these emerging threats together.”  Donald Trumpaposs attorney general, William Barr, was among those attending the talks. He added: “Encryption presents a unique challenge. We must ensure that we do not stand by as advances in technology create spaces where criminal activity of the most heinous kind can go undetected and unpunished. “Indeed, making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world. We are grateful for the leadership of Home Secretary Patel in facilitating these critical discussions and shared commitment to safety for all.” End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or recipient. They use a publicly available algorithm to scramble and unscramble the message on the phone itself, rather than the encryption being done by the service provider. The upshot of this is that Apple, WhatsApp, Telegram and other services that use the technology could not decrypt messages sent through their servicesthey wanted to. Allowing a back door into end-to-end encryption wouldn’t just make it less secure for terrorists - it’d make loads of things you do online every day more vulnerable to attacks from hackers.

Doctors discovered Gurcharan Kaur had a small colloid cyst, a slow growing tumour in the centre of her brain, behind her left eye. The -year-old claims she was told she was weeks away from developing seizures and has had brain surgery to remove the benign mass. Gurcharan had suffered irritated eyes for weeks but shrugged it off as an allergy caused by pollen or dust and dosed up on antihistamines. But while sightseeing in London last month, she noticed her eye was becoming more irritable than normal and it was becoming painful to blink.    The Etsy businesswoman walked past an opticians and decided it was time to get some help. A test revealed she had optical nerve damage on her left eye. Now tumour-free, Gurcharan, from Wolverhampton, wants to warn others of downplaying possible le-threatening symptoms. She said: I just thought I was developing hayfever. My eye would just sting in the morning but Iaposd just take an antihistamine and it would go away. I knew you could develop it at any time and I just thought it was just a case of that. Iaposd also been feeling dizzy and tired for a couple of months but I just shrugged it off. Iaposve always had perfect vision so it didnapost even cross my mind it would be something this serious. I feel like walking past Vision Express was a sign. If it hadnapost been there I would have just ignored it and avoided getting it checked out.    Gurcharan was on her way to meet older sister Sharan, , last month when she was spurred into action. She walked past a Vision Express store and decided to pop in, but she couldnapost get an instant appointment and claims she was initially given an eye wash. Gurcharan said: My eye was itching and I just thought it was a sign. My sister was still at her job interview so I had a bit of time by myself. I only went in there on a whim. I didnapost actually think I had something wrong with me. It was just a coincidence that I walked past it.  A few hours later Gurcharan ed to the Oxford Street store after noticing her left eye was beginning to turn red. Staff did an standard eye test and discovered Gurcharan - who hadnapost had an eye appointment in ten years - had optical nerve damage on her left eye. She said: I just kept complaining about how much it hurt. I kept getting my mirror out of my bag to checkthere was anything in my eye. My eye was just really, really itchy. I only went back as my sister was getting bored of me banging on about it. By this time my eye started to get a bit red and it started to hurt when I blinked. The last time I went to the opticians I was told I had : vision so it just didnapost seem right. She said the opticiansapos squeezed her in.  She was referred for a CT scan, and the pair took the train home and went straight to New Cross Hospital, in Wolverhampton. Doctors discovered abnormal fluid on her brain and a further scan revealed a small colloid cyst - a slow-growing tumour typically found near the centre of the brain. It was behind her left eye and warned she was weeks away from developing seizures, she said. Days later she had a two-hour operation which saw doctors cut her head open through minimal invasive surgery to remove the mass, sending Gurcharan home with a two-month course of epilepsy tablets.

They began saving the £, needed for the journey, and even moved in together to save money on rent.  months later they headed off, cycling through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America.    The couple, who are based in Edinburgh, Scotland, even got hitched half way through the trip in a romantic ceremony in Yosemite National Park in Calornia. Helen, a social media coordinator, said: We just thought: aposWhataposs stopping us  We could do it, couldnapost we apos Neither of us were happy in our jobs. There was literally nothing stopping us and all we needed was bikes, money and the determination to do it. Mike, a solicitor, had a photo of him standing in Yosemite on his Tinder profile. His bio said that this le goal was to cycle the world.    When Helen matched with him in January , her first message was: When are we leaving  She said: My first message, before I even introduced myself, was, aposWhen are we leaving apos. Mike replied: How about Tuesday  The couple soon arranged their first date. Mike said: We jokingly chatted about our cycle journey and the route we would take. It was a good way to flirt. But by their second date, the couple realised they were completely serious about the expedition. Helen had cycled theof the UK by herself the year before and Mike had done extensive bike trips in Canada and North America. Helen said: It felt like we had known each other for a long time. We just clicked.    The couple estimated that the trip, including bikes, insurance, flights, visas and spending money, would cost around £,. They planned to camp as much as they could, only splashing out on hotelsthere were no camping sites available. They immediately began to save money, cutting down on all luxuries. We spent no money at all, Mike said. We sold all our valuables, we moved in together after five months to save rent, we didnapost go out for drinks. We would maybe buy a £. bottle of wine once a week. Then I got an evening job working in a restaurant and Helen transcribed legal and medical documents at night to earn more money.After  months, the couple had stockpiled enough cash and in April  - a Tuesday - they set off. We wanted to go on a Tuesday because thataposs what Mike suggested in our first Tinder exchange, Helen explained. We left Glasgow and cycled to Newcastle to catch the ferry to Amsterdam. Once we were in mainland Europe, we felt like we had really begun. They cycled through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria. They then cycled through Turkey and into Georgia, before flying to Beijing. The pair pedalled for two months across China, then along the coast of Vietnam to Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore before flying to Perth, Australia. They spent three months biking through the southern and eastern coast of Australia before flying from Brisbane to Calornia. In April  they tied the knot in Yosemite in front of their parents and two friends from the UK. Helen said: We were together for  months when we got engaged in November . We always wanted to get married in Yosemite and we started planning the wedding when we were in China. Mike added: It is one of the most beautul places in the world. It was my profile picture on Tinder so it felt right that we got married there. Helen and Mike singled out cycling along a , mile stretch in Australia as the most intense bonding experience on the trip. Our biggest bonding challenge was cycling across the Outback, said Mike. Thereaposs a section that joins Eastern and Western Australia. Itaposs a road that is  miles long and thereaposs just about nine gas stations, thataposs it, thereaposs not even a bench.Thereaposs a -mile stretch where the road doesnapost bend or go up or down a hill - itaposs a straight line into the wind. For five months they travelled in countries where most people did not speak English and they could only speak to each other. She said: That was a big test. We knew we could get married at that point. After the wedding, the couple headed north to Salt Lake City, Utah.    However, as they left the city, tragedy struck. Newlywed Mike collapsed with hypothermia. A storm came in and Helen watched in horror as Mike weaved along the hard shoulder of the interstate highway. She said: His features were contorted into a screaming cry, his eyes were shut and his mouth was wide open. She flagged down a car and the driver called an ambulance. Paramedics treated Mike with heated packs and, once his temperature was back to normal, he was discharged. The couple decided to drive on to Denver, Colorado, but once there Mike felt well enough to get back on to his bike. They cycled into Canada and then flew to France, ing home in August  by way of Switzerland, Luxembourg and Belgium. The Brexit vote reduced our spending power so we had to cut our trip short, said Helen. We missed out on New Zealand.The couple had dficulty adjusting to le back home when they ed. It was really hard, Helen said. Part of me was glad to have a rest from cycling, it wasnapost like I still wanted to do it every day. We missed that freedom though. When we were on the bike all we had to worry about was what we were going to eat, where we were going to sleep and where we were headed.

Lucy Revell was walking home from youth club when she was hit on Pennine Way in Hull. Her mum, Sheena Revell, described the horric moment she got a knock at the door to say her daughter had been hit by a car nearby. Sheena,, said: I went running out of the house towards her and people had said she had been hit and that she went flying up in the air like a ragdoll. She came back down before managing to crawl herself to the side of the road and up onto the grass. Her mum sprinted towards her fearing that her daughter was going to be in a bad way but was relieved to see Lucy talking when she arrived at the scene of the accident, reports Hull Live.    “When I got to her she was talking and the car that had hit her stayed with her and nothing happened to the driver because it wasn’t his fault,” Mrs Revell said. “He thought she’d seen him and obviously she didn’t and stepped out and he has just hit her. “Everything was going through my mind at the time and I just didn’t know what to expect when I got there. I expected the worst and my heart just sank when somebody told me what had happened. “Luckily there were no broken bones and it was all grazes.” Lucy had to be placed on a spinal board and was taken to hospital where she underwent a CT scan. Fortunately, that came back all clear and she has since “bounced back” to full fitness. “She was very lucky,” Mrs Revell said. “You get people doing mph to mph down that road andshe had stepped out then it doesn’t bear imagining what would have happened.”    Lucy’s accident prompted one resident to start a petition for traffic calming measures down Pennine Way in north Bransholme. The road is next to a play area and near Highlands Primary School, and this prompted Sean Parker, , to start a rallying call to get a zebra crossing installed on the road. The dad-of-five said: “Within the past five months there have been two accidents and I thought that traffic management was needed so I started an online petition. “The first incident saw the girl go to hospital and the second was a hit-and-run. There’s a park now and a skate park too and it’s a busy road, especially at peak times.” Mr Parker says he has also seen cars hurtling down the road at twice the speed limit and thanks to his online push a new speed measuring device has been installed down Pennine Way.

Pregnant Leanne Whelan swung a hammer at Peter Taylor before proceeding to call him, queer and a f****t along with her sisters Louise and Samantha Whelan in Birkenhead, Liverpool, on August  of last year. Children playing in the street witnessed Leanne, , Louise, , and Samantha, , shouting and screaming at their victim, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, the three single mums walked free from Liverpool Crown Court after the judge ruled that their imprisonment would cause signicant harm to their children. Prosecutors said there was a dispute between the sisters and the paternal gran of Samanthaaposs children, Deborah McKenna, over a dog. They said Ms McKenna and her son Thomas Carson had made reports to social services about the welfare of children, but no action was taken.    Paul Becker, prosecuting, said it later involved Katie Cunningham, the girlfriend of Mr Carson, and Mr Taylor, a friend of the McKenna family. He said all parties on both sides of the dispute were warned by a housing association about their behaviour before the incident, on August  last year. The Whelan sisters said they were driving to their mumaposs when they saw Ms Cunningham outside Mr Carsonaposs house in Alwen Street, Birkenhead. Prosecutors accepted it was a chance encounter but they got out of a silver Mercedes and shouted come on letaposs go before Leanne got a hammer. Ms Cunningham fled into the house but Mr Taylor, who was in the back garden and heard shouting, came out to investigate. Mr Becker said the sisters shouted to Ms Cunningham and Ms McKenna to come out, but Mr Taylor told them to calm down. He said: Samantha Whelan was abusive and said aposf*** off, we donapost want you. Mr Becker said Mr Taylor stood his ground and Leanne swung the hammer, missing his upper body, during chaotic scenes. He said: Leanne Whelan was seen to be bouncing towards Mr Taylor, threatening and generally acting aggressively. Mr Taylor was shocked and scared. Mr Becker said the victim backed off and the sisters walked away but were all shouting homophobic comments about Mr Taylor    He said they also made threats to Ms Cunningham, screaming youaposre getting this over your head. Mr Taylor said he was left feeling depressed and anxious, looking over his shoulder all the time and struggling to sleep at night. The Whelan sisters said the victims were lying and claimed to have alibis, before admitting threatening behaviour ahead of a trial. Leanne, of Treetops Drive, Bidston, who has five previous convictions for  offences, also admitted possessing an offensive weapon. Her criminal record includes assaulting a police officer, common assault and assault causing actual bodily harm. Andrew McInnes, defending Leanne, said an allegation was made that Ms Cunningham assaulted one of the sisters the previous day. He said remorseful and embarrassed Leanne was a good mother to her children, aged seven months, three and . Mr McInnes said both Leanne and her two eldest children had dficulties, but she had since avoided the victims and planned to leave Birkenhead. Louise, of Wakefield Drive, Leasowe, has  previous convictions for  offences, including racially aggravated harassment against a supermarket security guard.    Anna Duke, defending Louise, said her client had two daughters, aged seven and nine, who suffered from ADHD and dyspraxia. She said a medical report found Louise could be very impulsive and lacked thinking skills, but she had signed up for counselling. Samantha, of Tollemache Road, Oxton, has three previous convictions for assaulting a police officer, battery and shoplting. Bernice Campbell, defending Samantha, said she had a daughter, , and son, aged four, who was awaiting an assessment for autism. She said: Samantha Whelan has been a victim herself, calling the police after she got beat up in front of her four-year-old child. Judge Gary Woodhall said Mr Taylor was subjected to homophobic abuse and the sistersapos emotions got out of control. He said: It appears the background to this offence was either a falling out over a dog or allegations of sexual impropriety and the like. Whatever it was, it led to a dispute between extended family members and tensions increasing up to the day of this offence. Clearly issues were ongoing for some time. Various complaints were made to social services including about the welfare of children. All parties involved - both sides - were warned about their behaviour by a housing association. Various allegations made to police were not prosecuted. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this dispute, itaposs clear to me by August  last year, you three resented the way things had not been investigated or not prosecuted, you three resented the way the witnesses in this case behaved, and you were angry and upset.

The footage of the unprovoked assault shows Mr Rudkin being wrestled to the floor by Tammyaposs husband Michael, , and held on the ground in a tight chokehold.    As Mr Rudkin is being held down by the neck, Tammy, who had drunk ten pints, straddles him and then proceeds to repeatedly punch him in the face before he is strangled into unconsciousness.Passers by appear to try and intervene in the fight, which happened in Shannon Road on June , , but the clip does not show them pulling Tammy away. Mr Rudkin was left unconscious, with his pregnant partner believing he was dead when she saw him at the scene.  Speaking about the release of the CCTV shown in Hull Crown Court, where Tammy Goodfellow was sentenced to  months in prison for her part in the vicious assault on him, Mr Rudkin said that he did not deserve what happened. Hopefully the footage will put all the rumours to bed that I started anything physical - I donapost deserve what happened to me, nobody does, he said. I donapost feel like any of them got a big enough sentence - the judge took too much pity on her [Tammyaposs] husband by giving him a suspended sentence just because he had kids to look after.Where is the justice  They could have taken my le away from me, and Iaposm still not right after the attack.I get headaches and worry about stuff - I get paranoid and wonapost go out on a night anymore. I just hope that from watching this CCTV people will realise how serious the attack was and that the city finally gets to see what happened, and I hope it opens up peopleaposs eyes to how serious an assault can be. Goodfellow had dragged her husband and son into the attacks, with -year-old son Joe George throwing punches at the victim before knocking himself unconscious when he stumbled and banged his head against a bollard.

New documentary Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding, also looks at so-called aposwarning signsapos during an interview the couple gave ahead of their wedding day. Excitement was growing around the world as the couple prepared to tie the knot in what would be the wedding of the decade. Angela Rippon, the anchor on BBC news, and ITVaposs Andrew Gardener were the two lucky journalists invited to quiz the couple. Their questions had to be pre-approved and they were warned not to stray from the script, and Charles and Diana came across as a couple very much in love and looking forward to their wedding. But looking back with hindsight, there was one moment of the interview which revealed the heartbreaking reality. Speaking in a new Channel  documentary Angela discussed the interview in depth for the first time. She said: When we first arrived at the Palace and met Prince Charles and Diana in a corridor, Prince Charles as always was very relaxed. Lady Diana less so, it was a whole new experience for her. Before they went in they were given a briefing by the Queenaposs press secretary Michael Shea. He told them very firmly that the interview would be endedthey asked any questions that had not been agreed.  During the interview Michael stood directly behind Angela out of camera shot, but in Dianaaposs eyeline. Iaposm not quite sure how comfortable it made her feel. I got the impression that Princes Charles was very protective towards her. Lady Diana was almost slumped in the chair, she was in new territory. She was out of her depth.

Crikey, anyone would be nervous. Angela watched the interview back in full for the first time for the new documentary. She said: With the knowledge of hindsight you read so much more into body language, what was said, looks that were given, reactions.

This is just one of the unsavoury sights in a tourist hotspot where drugs and gang warfare are exposing British families to a murky world of danger. This is Marbella – a haven for celebrities, and a top destination for Brits wanting to rub shoulders with the super-rich in the Spanish sun. But behind the facade of super­yachts and fast cars, ruthless gangs linked to Russia, Morocco and Col­­ombia have moved in for a slice of its multi-million pound drugs trade.    Our investigators headed to the glitzy Puerto Banus marina, where owners of luxury yachts moor for €, a day. Overlooking it are two vastly dferent worlds. Calle Ribera faces directly onto the ocean, with designer shops and trendy bars and restaurants that are packed out until the early hours. A favourite haunt of celebrities since the s, it is a firm favourite with the cast of TOWIE and is a great place to spot a footballer. Even here, not everything is as it seems. A waitress from Scotland, working in a bar for the summer, told us: “It’s full of fakers, so many ten bob millionaires who pretend they’re rich for a week in the sun. “But there’s a hell of a lot of real cash too, usually the quiet ones.”    But less then  yards back from this strip lies an altogether more seedy one, known to the Spanish as Calle del Infierno – “Hell Street”. Within a minute of moving from one to the other, Mirror reporters were offered cocaine and sex. A Romanian girl calling herself Lisa sidled up and offered sex for € in a nearby apartment block. “Come on, honey,” she urged. “I don’t have all night. I’m very popular but there’s lots of us to choose from.” In the course of the evening we counted at least  young women walking up and down, approaching any man who made even the slightest eye contact. The drug dealers too operate in a similar way – all within full view of the police, who did not seem to bat an eyelid.  Offering a gramme of cocaine for €, dealers assured us they could get any other drug within moments. Much of the action appeared to centre on infamous nightclub The Navy Bar. Once inside, it quickly becomes apparent it is a magnet for prostitutes looking for rich visitors. Within seconds, the Mirror reporters were swamped by women openly offering sexual services, from as little as € up to €. One told us: “This is just the day job. There are so many men with money here, why wouldn’t we come out to play  Once we leave here we’ll just go on the streets – they’re everywhere. This is Marbella, baby.” More worrying, though, is the rise of gangs that has seen an escalation in violence and a spate of murders.

The age of consent in the Sunshine State is -years-old while teenagers can drive at . The shocking details emerged in a Palm Beach Police Department probable cause affidavit in which several of billionaire Epstein’s victims and staff were interviewed under oath. The hedge fund manager, who is now in a New York correction centre awaiting trial for underage sex trafficking, was  at the time he sent the girl the flowers.    Alfredo Rodriguez, who worked as a butler and chauffeur and managed Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, told detectives he was like a “human ATM machine” and had been told to maintain a minimum balance of ,cash at all times to pay the girls. The former employee, who has since died, told Palm Beach police visitors appeared “too young to be masseuses,” adding they even ate like school children. “Rodriguez stated they would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time,” the affidavit said. Evidence suggests Epstein knew his victims were schoolgirls and the signs didn’t escape staff at the Royal Palm Beach High close to his home.  The girls endured taunting, and classmates called them “prostitutes.” After two girls fought, an administrator found one of them had in her purse. According to the affidavit: “Hestated one time under Epstein’s direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that provide a massage.” But when askedhe thought the scores of girls visiting Epstein’s home were underage he told police they appeared too young to be masseuses. He then told how Epstein ordered him to hire a car for the victim.    “On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought roses to so that she could drive herself to Epstein’s house without incident.” Rodriguez told police routinely wiped down Epstein’s sex toys following the visits, according to the police report. He said he provided iPods, jewellery and other gts to the girls. The affidavits were in  when Florida police were investigating Epstein.

This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5e6501d1.45553844.jpg ","title":"a look at dundee uniteds options for championship opener this weekend","story":"Being a manager who prepares meticulously for every game, it’s a safe bet Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson already knows his starting line-up for Saturday’s Championship opener against Inverness Caley Thistle.Of course, we won’t know what his thoughts on that are until an hour before kick-off at Tannadice.And while Arabs who’ve been following the team closely since the start of pre-season will have a fair idea of most of the names on the team sheet, there are two or three areas the manager will have had to give a lot of thought to.Although United’s spending power means Neilson has cover for every position the friendlies and Betfred Cup games over the past few weeks have given a pretty clear indication of what he regards as he strongest side – almost.Starting from the back, that Benjamin Siegrist will be in goal against ICT is a given.In one Betfred outing and a couple of friendlies, the ing Deniz Mehmet has shown himself to be a more-than-able deputy andSiegrist was to suffer a loss of form or injury, there would be no worries about him stepping up.Siegrist’s form toward the end of last season and in his games so far, though, mean he is a certainty to start the league campaign as No  – and rightly so.Likewise at right-back, summer signing Liam Smith is nailed on to make his Championship debut in this one. The manager fought hard to get him and,Ayr United had been willing to do business, would have signed him in January.Smith fits the attacking profile Neilson wants of his full-backs and has done enough in his early games to suggest he’ll be both a regular starter and an important player in the months to come.Next to him, the names of skipper Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly could be written in indelible ink on the team lines.They’ve been the first choice partnership in the middle of the defence since the beginning of February and, so long as they are fit and available, that will continue to be the case this term.The first big question regarding Saturday comes at left-back. Argentine Adrian Sporle was brought in to play there but his outings so far have shown he’ll need time to adjust to Scottish football.That and the form of Jamie Robson suggests the Scot could get the nod, at least for the early weeks of the season.In midfield, Paul McMullan will surely start wide on the right and,he needs to sharpen up on his delivery, his direct running and ability to go past defenders makes him another key man.In the middle Calum Butcher’s strength and experience means he’s sure of his place and beside him will be Sam Stanton or Ian Harkes, both of whom the manager knows he can rely on.Right now the front places, whether it’s as two out-and-out strikers or one up top and the other slightly withdrawn, are also easy to predict.That will go to Nicky Clark and marquee signing Lawrence Shankland. Clark’s habit of getting important goals makes him valuable and Shankland has done enough in his short time at the club to show he can be the main supply of goals this season.With Peter Pawlett and Osman Sow both nearing fitness again, the attacking options should increase in the next couple of weeks or so and, once that’s the case, the manager’s job in selecting a team will be more dficult.He also knows he can now call on the young trio of Louis Appere, Scott Banks and Logan Chalmers.They’ve all shown they are ready to play a part at first-team level but, right now, there is no need to throw them in."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-nightlife-entertainment-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-big-nights-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"city-s-first-female-lord-provost-tea-tycoon-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  This summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

Around  jobs could be created at the development.A decision notice by Aberdeenshire Council said: “The proposal includes the erection of a five-pumpplus two HGV-pump petrol station and associated retail unit with integral food offerings within the same building.“Drive-thru unit one lends itself to being the proposed drive-thru coffee shop.”The decision notice added: “The development proposals, which are clearly intended to tap into the existing passing trade on the A, are of a scale which would also complement and expand upon the existing uses within the business park in an accessible location, and would not erode the character or amenity of the area.“The scale of retail proposals and food offerings would not be considered signicant in terms of competing with the existing town centre uses and would likely have the added benefit of reducing vehicular movements in the town centre.”Portlethen and district councillor Ian Mollison said: “This will bring more jobs to the area as well as offering new services to residents.“I wish the developers success. It is good to see the City South business park expanding.”The roads department at the local authority had originally submitted an objection to the proposals, claiming there was insufficient information about parking.However, the roads team withdrew its objection after discussions with the developer.Rob Buffan, planning manager at the EG Group, previously told the Evening Express it could create between  and  jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at lithicsresearch@btinternetPIC:An artists rendering of Argyll#s ancestors making tools. no_aargyllarcheology"},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne

not with a crook in hand as the young Saint, it was to be many years later as a young man clutching St Ronanrsquos Blue Banner.The childhood dream became a reality on Friday, when he graced the stage and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games

Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"pencaitland-pub-winton-arms-sale","story":"The Winton Arms, on the villagersquos Main Street, is being advertised online for pound,.The bar, which has an outdoor seated area and a pool room, is owned by pub company Punch.Andy Spencer, managing director, said: ldquoWe have made the decision that The Winton Arms no longer fits in the long-term plans for our pub estate.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems.

Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes. It just felt so intuitive [to hug him] becausethat was my father or grandfather, I would have wanted somebody to reach out and say: Its OK, Im here for you.\"Follow Dr Punam Krishan on Twitter and Instagram at @DrPunamKrishan"},{"url":null,"title":"mps-use-brexit-reset-farm-funding","story":"The cross-party group of MPs said leaving the EU was a chance to fix problems in the current formula, which sees low funding for Scottish farms and crofts under the Common Agricultural Policy .The committee urged the Government to drop an ldquooutdated method that ldquofailed to reflect Scotlandrsquos unique agricultural conditions and practices.It recommended a new system linking funding to a nationrsquos proportion of less favoured land, with farmers and crofters working in challenging conditions receiving the most support.The UK Governmentrsquos pilot seasonal agriculture scheme was also criticised for not providing enough workers to address Scotlandrsquos agricultural workforce crisis.MPs called for it to cover , workers, and a scrapping of application and visa interview fees to open the scheme to all motivated workers, not just those who can afford to apply.SNP committee chairman Pete Wishart said: ldquoScotland has some of the most challenging farming environments in the UK and yet Scottish farming is the cornerstone of Scottish food and drink industry and farms and crofts remain central to many thriving communities.ldquoIt is nonsensical that funding through the CAP has not recognised these challenging conditions so my committee is calling on the UK Government to take Brexit as an opportunity to rewrite the rules of agricultural funding.

There is a reason why the Scottish Tories talk about a second independence referendum as much as, or more than, the SNP. They need it. It is the foundation for their single-issue campaign, which has already stretched across three Scottish and UK general elections, to great success, and is about to encompass another, in . Without the second independence referendum, and the ability to whip the unionist vote into a frenzy, what do the Scottish Tories have  Not much, in truth. A set of good, competent people, who would be perfectly able to run a government, but no policy  to make wavering voters ndash the lsquomaybesrsquo ndash feel compelled to tick the box with the C-word in it.Herein lies the lesson for Jo Swinson. The Liberal Democrats, today, is a single issue party. It is a party of Remain, setting itself apart from two parties of Leaveand Labour, a party with a pro-Leave leader who occasionally nods to a change of direction to keep the inhabitants of the tent inside.But, hard as it is to believe today, the Brexit issue is going to go away, and when it does there needs to be something to fall back on. This is precisely the trap that The Independent Group, or Change UK, fell into, andthe Scottish Tory analogy is too far from home for Ms Swinson to contemplate, perhaps this one is easier.Change UK formed with the twin aim of becoming an enduring party of government and stopping Brexit, but reality slapped them in the face with swt, ruthless aggression. You canrsquot be both. You canrsquot be a narrow single-issue party which welcomes only pro-second referendum Remainers and simultaneously be wide enough to be an enduring party of government.So, perverse as this may sound for a party with a hand on the shoulder of  per cent of the population, the success of Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems is not about Brexit. Brexit is, instead, a bridge for the Lib Dems to the real promised land.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs FruxDY-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests FruxDY.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Psychologist analyses behaviour during Nicola Sturgeon - Boris Johnson meetingThat promised land is an extraordinary gap in the political party market in the UK. In Europe it would be called social democracy in Britain, we might better know it as Blairism.As a party of the centre-right, the Tories will never occupy that space, evenBoris Johnson reclaims his lsquoOne Nationrsquo history. Conversely, Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour party has utterly vacated this centre-left, social-democratic ground and shows no desire whatsoever toto it.This is Jo Swinsonrsquos ground. She is Emmanuel Macron. She is Stefan Lofven. She is Mette Frederiksen. Except theyrsquore all in office, and shersquos not.In practice, this means a gradual but holistic policy sht, and a sht in attitude away from being a party of protest and towards being a realistic party of government. The partyrsquos social liberalism is in the right place, but it is combined with a message on the economy and on public service reform which is left-wing, interventionist, and bears all the hallmarks of a party of protest which has quickly forgotten the realities of government.If Ms Swinson wants to be Prime Minister, these are the strategic changes which will have to be addressed, and the tough choices which will have to be made.In Scotland, there will be a fascinated observer. Willie Rennie, Ms Swinsonrsquos Scottish counterpart, is further from power, but also has an opportunity to exploit a gap in the market. Arguably, his position is even more unique. Only one party in Scotland combines a belief in remaining in the EU, in common with  per cent of the population, and remaining in the UK, in common with  per cent of the population ndashMr Renniersquos.In common with Ms Swinson, to achieve this needs not just the right message, but numbers. With a paltry five MSPs, Mr Rennie can fill a taxi, but not a Cabinet. Just as,I were Ms Swinson, Irsquod be looking for another  Chukka Umunnas to defect,I were Mr Rennie Irsquod be looking to start with - disaffected social democrats from the Scottish Labour MSPs at Holyrood.They exist, and they have far more in common with the Lib Dems than they have with the  incarnation of the Labour party.This needs one thing which is hard to come across. Courage. Politics is a tribal business, and leaving the tribe is hard. Few make the jump. If we want a better country, and better politics, we need a straw to break the camelrsquos back."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10209618.jpg?type=article-full","title":"confusion-broken-waste-recycling-system","story":"Unfortunately, with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear the way councils approached the implementation of the governmentrsquos waste policy, was often flawed.For a start, there was no edict from government imposing any unormity on how the  Scottish councils went about implementing kerbside recycling collections. The lack of unormity is a source of confusion to many householders.Secondly, as Forbes Connor, Managing Director of Changeworks Recycling observes, Chinarsquos willingness to take co-mingled waste, which ended in January last year, provided some councils with an easy, low cost solution.Co-mingled waste, also called mixed dry waste, was collected in mixed stream recycle bins. The idea was that recyclable materials like glass, plastics, paper and cardboard could all be put in one bin. These would then be hand sorted at purpose-built Materials Recycling Facilities .What became clear, however, is that co-mingling waste contaminates and degrades the quality of the streams. Johan Sundblad, Managing Director of SAICA Natur UK Ltd, one of the largest materials recycling companies, says: ldquoIt is very hard to use mechanical means to sort co-mingled paper, cans and glass to the required quality levels, so councils are now having to go back  years to proper sorting at source. However, households in Scotland do not yet have a great track record in producing clean streams.It just takes a small amount of food or other contaminants in a paper stream to render it useless for anything except incineration, he says. Segregated waste streams required a lot more effort and initial expense from councils as far as the collection effort was concerned.Once China closed its doors, the writing was on the wall for co-mingled waste.On the positive side, Sundblad says public and business awareness of the importance of recycling has probably never been higher. ldquoThe vast majority of us are now focused on the impact we have on the environment. There is a lot of work still to do, but the level of public awareness is very encouraging, he says.Streets Ahead : Nursery kids clean up cityIn a recent report, the BBC looked at the recycling rules of five of Scotlandrsquos largest councils, East Renfrewshire, West Lothian, Clackmannanshire, Moray and Inverclyde.Big dferences emerged as to what could and could not be recycled at the kerbside depending on which council one was in.The report highlighted dferences such as some councils being willing to accept glass collections at the kerbside, while others required householders to use community glass recycling collection points. A few councils, such as West Lothian accept plastic carrier bags for recycling, others donrsquot.New research finds single-use packaging adds poundm a year to Scots shopping billsHelensburgh, for instance, had paper, cardboard, cans and plastic all going into the same blue bin. Another example of the gulf between the Scottish Governmentrsquos ambitions and the ability of Scottish councils to fulfil those ambitions, can be seen from the way the councils have responded to the governmentrsquos proposed  ban on domestic ldquoblack bag refuse going to landfill. The idea behind the ban is to further accelerate the ldquocircular economy concept and to prevent more than a million tonnes of household rubbish a year from winding up in landfill sites.However, according to the local authority body, Cosla, the message from Scottish councils is that they are very unlikely to be in a position to comply with the ban by the January ,  deadline. To do so would mean building a number of waste-to-heat incineration facilities to deal with whatever rubbish remains after households have stepped up their recycling reuse efforts.lsquoRadical actionrsquo now required to raise Scotlandrsquos recycling ratesMany councils are now building or planning to build these facilities, but there will not be sufficient capacity in Scotland by January .The ban means that no landfill operators in Scotland will be able to accept biodegradable municipal waste, which is to say, waste that can undergo aerobic or anaerobic decomposition. This includes food waste, garden rubbish, paper, cardboard and packaging, and textiles.Construction and demolition waste is excluded from the ban.Councils can hardly complain that the government has sprung this deadline on them. The ban was initially proposed as part of the WasteRegulations , and has been a signicant plank in the governmentrsquos Zero Waste Plan, which dates back to . That plan foresaw a nationwide recycling rate of % by , at which point only % of Scotlandrsquos domestic and municipal waste is supposed to go to landfill.The  target is actually a reaction to the European Unionrsquos Waste Directive, which was published in . This set a target for all participating nations to reduce the amount of domestic waste going to landfill by % by .Can we give councils % clean waste or should processing plants have technology to sort any accidental confusion The government has been adamant that it will not move the date of the landfill ban despite the misgivings of many councils.Even when the ban is in force, some black bags will, inevitably, still have to be collected since not all rubbish is recyclable.According to a report from the local government body, Cosla, councils are saying that up to a million additional tonnes of garbage will have to be trucked out of Scotland every yearthe material cannot go to landfill.Scotland already sends more than . million tonnes of rubbish down to England and where every year, according to recent press reports, so this would take the total being trucked out of Scotland to around three million tonnes.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland said: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos targets on reuse and recycling to combat the climate emergency are vital, and rightly ambitious. ldquoThey require a collective effort, and while signicant progress has already been made, much more work is needed. Itrsquos important that people across Scotland continue to do the right thing by recycling, despite what can be a confusing array of product labels and collection services, he says.ldquoLocal authorities have recognised the need to introduce consistent and comprehensive recycling services across Scotland through the Household Recycling Charter, but swter action is needed to make it as easy as possible for people to understand what can and canrsquot be recycled.ldquoZero Waste Scotland has played a key role in helping councils to increase their recycling services, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and helping local authorities prepare for the  ban.ldquoOur pioneering Carbon Metric system measuring the whole-le carbon impacts of all Scotlandrsquos waste gives us the clearest picture yet of what is driving up the emissions behind the climate emergency, to ensure policy and action is targeted where needed most."},{"url":null,"title":"4 000 aberdeenshire homes take up satellite broadband option","story":"A # million investment by Aberdeenshire Council in the region#s broadband network has seen major strides made in terms of improved services.Councillors were told at Thursday’s full authority meeting that , homes had since taken up a satellite option to access a better service.Much of the money was pumped into an extension of the fibre network, but the challenging topography and rurality of the Shire saw a big take up in the satellite system.Infrastructure services chief Stephen Archer told councillors that more than , premises would be able to access fibre in the region which would offer a “signicant benefit and improvement” over existing services.He said: “Fibre is where we need to go because other technologies are neither cost-effective nor fully evolved and developed to allow us to put in robust connectivity across Aberdeenshire.”With some ,km of fibre now laid under the latest scheme, Mr Archer described it is a “celebration of success”, but stressed that pockets of Aberdeenshire still suffered from poor connectively – often still suffering with dial-up speeds.While welcoming the results so far, council leader Jim Gford said there was still a long way to go to support North-east communities.He said: “There are still far too many properties in many places that don’t have decent – and in some cases any – broadband and that’s a piece of work we have to keep moving forward.”Aberdeenshire Council’s contribution of £m was the largest local authority contribution to the programme.Work is continuing on installations in Aberdeenshire and is likely to run until later this year, but it has already seen the number of street cabinets in operation increase from  to  and the number of premises benefiting from a fibre to the premises connection increase from  to .Councillors will also advised that the Scottish Government’s R programme will be coming onstream later this year which will prioritise FTTP connections as these are the future-proofed solution.R will offer at Mbps connection to % of addresses in Scotland, but councillors were advised that it does not have sufficient funding to deliver a FTTP connection to all eligible premises in Aberdeenshire.A programme of “aligned interventions” to provide an alternative solution to these premises will start almost simultaneously, with Aberdeenshire in the running to be a pilot area with potential suppliers having already been approached.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A therapeutic gardening scheme for people with dementia was launched at HMP Dumfries last August.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything.

The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.

And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

It was by no means certain they would get it – with  per cent having their requests turned down – and the average payout was £. One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no ministerial salary for scottish tory junior minister colin clark","story":"A Scottish Tory MP appointed as a junior minister at the Scotland Office has been denied a pay rise while his English colleague will get nearly #, on top of his MPs# salary, it has been revealed.Colin Clark, the MP for Gordon, was made parliamentary undersecretary at the Scotland Office, as well as being appointed as a junior whip, but will not be paid for either role.: English MP being appointed Scotland Office minister a slap in the face for Ruth, says SNPHowever, the Worcester MP Robin Walker, who was controversially named first as one of two junior ministers at Dover House is being paid a ministerial salary, set at £, under the latest guidance.Mr Walker’s appointment as the first English MP to work at the Scotland Office since the th century sparked claims of another snub to the Scottish Tories, after Ruth Davidson’s appeal not to sack Scottish Secretary David Mundell were rejected by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Mr Clark and Alister Jack, the new Scottish Secretary, are the only Scottish Tories to have been named on Mr Johnson’s front bench.: Ruth Davidson set for no-deal Brexit clash with Boris JohnsonThe Gordon MP did not comment when contacted by the Times, which first reported the news.

Go home wee Jimmy krankieWhy shouldwe be dictatedto by the whingingminority!SHETLAND has spoken loud and clear,and Ms Sturgeon is first minister an elected politician putting our views across #get over it.Far more voted to remain part of the UK.Shetland and Scotland has spoken loud and clear, it#s called democracy. Is it not time you got over it Alas, Ms Sturgeon#sEU policy is vacuous, unsustainable humbug. If Britain stays in the EU, Scotland will automatically leave on Independence Day, creating an immediate “hard border” with the UK . EU tarfs will apply and trade negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster. Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland. The Smith Commission Reportsubsequently made the following recommendation: #Crown Estate#. Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year.

DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe.

There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"aer lingus sorry for belfast flight diversion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His dad described the service as \"a beautul tribute\" to his son and thanked members of St Bronaghs GAA Club who formed a guard of honour outside the church.

He also echoed Mr Durkans call for a collective response.\"Police are trying to work with the community and deliver policing buttrying to be tough with this dissident element who are trying to cause disruption,\" Mr Middleton added.\"The concern would be thatthe police went into Creggan and took those signs down, that could have a counter-effect in that area and could give dissidents propaganda that could be used against the police.\"That is not to say the police should turn a blind eye, but I dont think they are.\"Since the death of Lyra McKee, we have seen that there is a strong support for law and order and for the police in Creggan, and the police dont want to set that back. \"From a police perspective, there is a safety concern for officers, but also I think there would be a concern about giving those who put the signs up ammunition to attack the police.\"I think the solutions have to come from a number of agenciesthe DfI, but also the local community.\"I know it can be very dficult for residents to put themselves out there because they can be targeted.\" The DfI was contacted for response."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38359611.ece/091fc/BINARY/gregory_marylou.jpg","title":"sinn fein blinded by dreams of united ireland says gregory campbell after border poll call","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors. PBP Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced his support for all “necessary action”.NIPSA representative Ruaidhri O’Sandair had one final message for the department of Finance, “Sue Gray, where’s our pay ”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past. Of course we also need a Medical School for the North West as part of any new university, but it is only a very small part of a much bigger picture.“We need a minimum of , additional students in this city.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"picture special royal welsh show powys county times camera club stars","story":"A magnicent beast at the Royal RWelsh Show from Mick Pleszkan.\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsFrom the equine classes at the Royal Welsh Showby Mick Pleszkan\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsAgony of choice...

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so. This is what we are used to unfortunately. It is very sad that I have to say that but it is what our policing environment looks like here in Northern Ireland.“I think, even in terms of our response on Saturday morning in the early hours, it shows how alive we are to the possibilities with such devices. While it saddens me, it doesn’t surprise me.”try catch  TrendingPSNI probe after man dies suddenlyMumrsquos heartbreak after dog dies following lake swimScott Brown to be laid to restSafety concerns at state of land amid lsquoblame gamersquo over ownershipArrest after pound, of suspected heroin found in Co Armagh*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
