In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, some states quarantined citizens others made the wearing of face masks mandatory, at the same time as shutting down “all places of amusement”. According to a law passed in San Francisco in October of that year, on the day that state-wide infections passed 50,000, anyone seen not wearing a gauze face covering was subject to fines that ranged from $5 to $100 and the possibility of 10 days’ imprisonment.The order appeared to work in “flattening the curve” of infection in San Francisco other American states took up the practice, which was also promoted across the Atlantic in Paris and in Manchester. Supply quickly became an issue, so in America churches and community groups organised mass mask-making sessions. When the order was lifted at noon on the last day of November, a blaring whistle sounded and, the San Francisco Chronicle noted, people threw off their masks leaving “the sidewalks and runnels strewn with the relics of a tortuous month”.The relaxation of the law proved premature. As the death toll rose again in a third wave of the disease – and despite the protests of the newly formed Anti-Mask League – mandatory mask-wearing was reintroduced for another six weeks at the beginning of the following year.

Together the groups speak for Hiscox policyholders with insurance cover of more than £50m.Hiscox sold business interruption insurance policies to businesses before the pandemic, which stated that it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.However, in recent weeks business owners have filed claims with Hiscox and other commercial insurers, only to be informed that their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic.Mark Killick, from the steering committee of the Hiscox Action Group, which represents more than 300 affected firms, said: “Hiscox’s behaviour has been disgraceful and is threatening thousands of UK businesses. By working together with the NTIA, we hope to force Hiscox to do the right thing before it is too late for many of our members.”Business interruption policies typically pay up to £100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said their members’ policies have clearly been triggered by coronavirus, adding “we are determined to do everything we can to get Hiscox to pay out quickly and in full”.The Hiscox Action Group is being represented by City law firm Mishcon de Reya. Richard Leedham, the partner leading the action, said the firm was looking at the policyholders’ contracts. He said: “Hiscox has provided a very broad form of wording and its natural meaning would cover someone whose business was interrupted by the lockdown.”The Bermuda-based insurer has said it expects to pay out between $150m (£120m) and $175m (£140m) to larger firms with specific event-cancellation cover, but states that small firms aren’t covered for pandemics.Hiscox said in a statement: “We understand these are incredibly difficult times for businesses and we are paying claims that are covered by the policies we issue fairly and quickly. We review every case inidually, and if any customer has concerns about the application of their policy, we encourage them to get in touch with us directly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8fd2bed2ee65e138428627861309d49e35cfeb/0_116_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2519cbf7e54de5abcfefe0846aa0fcd9","title":"the coronavirus has exposed the imbalances in modern britain life","story":"What’s needed after Covid-19 is a bigger, smarter state, with more devolved decisions, a greener economy and a stronger safety netThe words are straining to come out. Boris Johnson hero worships Winston Churchill so it is obvious how the prime minister will pitch this week’s announcement of the plan to get Britain out of lockdown.In late 1942, victory in the North African desert had suggested that the tide of the war might have turned but Churchill was cautious. “Now this is not the end”, he said in a speech at London’s mansion house. “It is not even the beginning of the end. but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”Yet one reason it had taken Britain more than three years for this moment to arrive was that the country had been ill-prepared for war, something Churchill had complained about ceaselessly in speeches during the 1930s demanding rearmament against the fascist threat.Johnson is unlikely to dwell on this chapter of Churchill’s career, but the fact remains that the country was ill-equipped to fight Covid-19 in February 2020, just as it was to fight Hitler in September 1939. What’s more, everything the government has done in the past two months makes that clear.As in the 1930s, a decade of austerity, of penny-pinching and cheese-paring has taken its toll. Then it was a shortage of Hurricanes and Spitfires this time it was a lack of trained nurses, intensive care beds and ventilators.One consolation for Neville Chamberlain when he eventually abandoned appeasement was that Britain still had formidable industrial capacity that could be converted to war production. The hollowing out of manufacturing in successive waves over the past 40 years means that option no longer exists.Britain still has world-class manufacturers but they operate in only a small number of sectors. The aversion to anything resembling an industrial strategy has left the country highly exposed to long supply chains. Most of these terminate in China, which – as the NHS found when it took delivery of unusable ventilators – cannot always be relied upon.The same applies to the welfare safety net. One of the lessons of the 1930s was that many of the men who were called up were in poor physical shape to fight as a result of disease, under-nourishment and poor housing. Britain is a much richer and healthier country than it was 80 years ago, but poverty still kills. The Office for National Statistics data showing that the death rate in the most deprived parts of the Britain is double the rate in affluent areas tells its own story.For the past decade, the government’s narrative has been that the benefits system is too generous and that savings must be made. Yet within days of the lockdown being announced Sunak was increasing universal credit because the payments were not enough to live on. That remains the case.The job of actually fighting the current war – the poor bloody infantry in this instance – has been groups whose role in keeping the economy going has long been overlooked: bus drivers, supermarket shelf-stackers, care home workers, nurses prominent among them. These are people who can’t do their jobs from home, but who are putting themselves at risk after having just suffered a decade of public sector pay freezes and stagnant living standards. They are unlikely to react well to any attempt by the government to reimpose austerity once the economy is out quarantine. The lesson of Labour’s landslide election victory in 1945 is that voters will look back at the pre-crisis world and come to a simple conclusion: never again.Johnson knows this, which is why he is saying that this time the government will look after the people who suffer and not just the banks. Making good on this pledge will take some doing, and means learning some lessons.The first is that getting the right big picture, macro-economic structure, right is crucial. It is not, though, just a question of repudiating austerity and gunning for as much activity as possible: growing the economy has to be consistent with greening the economy.The second lesson is a bigger state has to be a smarter state, and that requires ceding more power to a local level. Britain’s heavily centralised approach to Covid-19 testing has compared badly to Germany’s devolved model, for example.A switched-on state would demand a price for the unprecedented amount of support it is providing. That might mean taking a stake in mid-sized manufacturing businesses, as the employers’ group Make UK has suggested. It would also mean bigger companies agreeing to put workers on boards, signing up to carbon-reduction targets or domiciling themselves in the UK for tax purposes. There should be no free lunches.The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the imbalances in modern Britain. It has highlighted the need for more community-based banks, for more investment in vocational education, for an industrial strategy that encompasses the everyday economy as well as trendy hi-tech sectors, and for a stronger social safety net. Above all, it has made the case for greater national self-sufficiency so that we will be more resilient next time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2928cd1723c68e70f9474d47397a7839028f652/0_74_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6574307d620780331ff9629813d3579","title":"the british charlatan style has been sent packing by too much reality","story":"Boris Johnson has trumpeted jingoism in the face of the coronavirus facts • See all our coronavirus coverageAs they were bound to fail. From the moment Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Michael Gove won the Brexit referendum in 2016 by promising we could inflict a shuddering change to our country without feeling pain, failure has been inevitable. The only wonder is that it has taken so long for the British charlatan style to die.It’s dying now as surely as the lost souls in care homes disappearing out of sight and out of mind. I say British rather than English because Alex Salmond’s promises of Scottish independence without tears anticipated Johnson’s promises of a painless Brexit and because British dishonesty takes a distinctive form.Since 2016, Johnson has been a postmodern populist. His myths have been cheerful, a world away from the menace behind Trump’s snarls. He claimed the impossible was possible with a wink to the camera and a smirk on his face. He believed, or seemed to believe, you could never be sure, that all difficulties could be overcome with a dose of British pluck.Good government in these circumstances would have been next to impossible. Now the pandemic has hit, it is impossible. Everyone involved in the fatal failure to contain the virus in February and early March is covering their backs. You do not, however, need to stare too hard at Johnson’s belated statement on 21 March that “we’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub” to know that the ideology of the Brexiters is out of time. Johnson did not act until the pandemic had engulfed us because his puffed-up nationalism held that the Brits, so favoured by providence, would refuse to imitate the cowed continentals. We stood alone in 1940. We stood up for ourselves in the Brexit referendum. Why couldn’t we stand at the bar now?Behavioural “science”, a dubious discipline, since human behaviour does not follow paths as predictable as Newtonian physics, provided a pseudo-intellectual veneer to cover nationalist self-regard. Ministers and their scientific advisers tarried because they thought freeborn Britons would tire of the lockdown. “There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain,” said Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, on 9 March. In fact, the British were locking themselves down days before the government finally accepted the realities of the pandemic. We did so because one aspect of human behaviour remains predictable: we don’t want to die. Far from suffering from lockdown fatigue, every survey shows that an alarmed public is not straining to “get back to normal”.Invocations of the wartime spirit, so characteristic of Brexiters who have never fought a war, led to the dallying with the possibility of “herd immunity”. Britain could take the Blitz, so it could take the virus. Meanwhile, the love of simplistic slogans and over-promising so characteristic of the Brexit movement has been displayed to the point of tedium.Yet the practicalities best explain why, in the words of Professor Chris Grey, one of the best chroniclers of our decline, a Brexit movement “impervious to reason and incapable of engaging with complexity” has reached its terminus. Millions of Britons must have gazed on the cabinet and thought, “really, Tories, is that your best shot?” They should remember that Johnson destroyed the careers of Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Ed Vaizey and many another Conservatives with ministerial experience because they wouldn’t inflict a no-deal Brexit on Britain.He sent others to the backbenches. Jeremy Hunt, for example, was health secretary for six years and you can wonder why he isn’t helping out now. Then you remember he challenged Johnson for the Tory leadership and so had to be punished. I am not asking you to like the Conservative politicians Johnson pushed aside, only to accept that the emergency demands the services of ministers who know how government works. Instead, we have a dilettante PM, a cabinet of nobodies and a civil service policed by Vote Leave propagandists, who can fool the country in a referendum but have no idea how to manage it in a crisis. An administration of all the sycophants rather than all the talents.Its time has gone. I am not saying we are about to enter a better age of competent government. Hard times are rarely good times for the centre left and it looks as if we are heading into the hardest of times. Angry people cling to what they have in a slump. They blame foreigners and turn to shop-soiled saviours. Who knows, after populism with a smirk on its face could come populism with the authentic snarl. What’s over is the glib, deceitful spirit of 2016 with its false promise that bills need never be paid. The Brexit right has attempted a final rally. It dismissed warnings about public health as “over the top” just as it dismissed warnings about Brexit as “Project Fear” and assured us that “German carmakers” or some other knight on a shining unicorn would make everything all right.But the exhausted Johnson has stopped listening to his old allies. Even he knows that Britain will pay for being one of the last European countries to go into lockdown by being among the last to leave. There are many reasons why yesterday’s retailers of counterfeit optimism have become today’s frightened pessimists. To be precise, 27,510 reasons – and rising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a880d631bf991ac56471358bfb8bda3abb17b25/0_314_9600_5761/master/9600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1b089e6256d3020b9820e8502f44d4e","title":"the promise of an oxford vaccine reveals how a new britain could thrive","story":"The partnership between AstraZeneca and the Jenner Institute should jolt our industry and banksThere was some good news last week. Oxford University’s Jenner Institute announced it was teaming up with AstraZeneca to take a promising prototype of coronavirus vaccine into volume production by the autumn. Of course there are caveats – the institute’s confidence in its vaccine may not be validated by the trials that began last week.Still it was heartening, after so much tragic incompetence, that a British university and a British company could forge a relationship of such potential national importance.AstraZeneca’s recent history also tells a cautionary tale – pointing to how our financial, ownership and banking ecosystem is fundamentally decadent. But it also points to a story of promise: if we can be as fast as we’ve been in developing a potential vaccine, in building Nightingale hospitals and in learning to live online, perhaps we can repurpose the British financial system just in time.The cautionary tale: Britain very nearly did not have AstraZeneca. If six years ago the company had not had some lucky breaks it would not now exist, taken over by the US drug company Pfizer that had no parallel commitment to sustaining drug research in Britain. It was and is run by a Frenchman, Pascal Soriot, passionate about medicine (his three brothers are doctors), who knew the long-term value of the company, did not accept that the share price was all and was backed by an unexpectedly determined board. What’s more, the company being half Swedish – the result of an EU-driven merger between the Swedish Astra and the best of the old ICI – it had the unwavering support of long-term shareholders, notably the Wallenberg family holding. They, together with some unfashionably long-term British shareholders, held the line.It was a close-run thing. David Cameron’s government won some worthless promises from Pfizer, but it said it would not stand in the way of “market forces”, whatever the company’s strategic importance. No thanks to it, but rather those long-term shareholders, Britain now has one of the world’s great drug companies, beginning to flourish while Pfizer is in the doldrums. Its value is crystal clear.Sadly, the same cannot be said of Britain’s capacity to manufacture a range of medical equipment – witness the ongoing debacle over PPE, ventilators, face masks and the rest. The same decadent financial and ownership system is in part to blame. One statistic reveals its priorities: of the £1.7tn stock of British bank lending, £1.45tn is on real estate while a tiny £10bn has been advanced to small- and medium-sized manufacturers.But as economic disaster looms, British banks could, and should, become conduits for finance to flow to our crippled business sector, and in particular manufacturing – as urgently as the Jenner Institute is trying to develop a vaccine. Unless that happens, Britain is going to have the deepest and most prolonged recession in its history.In fairness, the Treasury and Bank of England have been quick in creating some genuinely innovative financial support packages. There is the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the generous term funding scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises, which banks can access to finance up to £190bn of new lending over the next 12 months. As the Bank of England dryly observes, that is 13 times more than the banks managed themselves over the entirety of 2019. On top, the banks were told not to pay any idends to help conserve capital, better to support the impending scale of lending to distressed companies.British banks are trying – £1.3bn was lent last week and 25,000 applications processed – but the degree of cultural and organisational change required is dramatic. To avert a disastrous wave of closures, bankruptcies and redundancies by the summer, the weekly rate of lending has to rise to between £12bn an £15bn. That’s lending in a week what banks used to lend in a year. It is telling that Britain’s 10,000 bank branches have been closed or are working greatly reduced hours during lockdown. They do not have the economic function of supermarkets, which have had to stay open. British banks have a longstanding aversion to business lending: it is regarded as too risky and costly. With the same ruthlessly short-term shareholders owning them as those prepared to sell AstraZeneca to the highest bidder, banks know that they must deploy their capital to where profits are high and reliable – real estate lending. This means that the piping through which emergency credit must flow is atrophied and weak.The chancellor should chair an emergency financial task force with the purpose of driving lending up by the day, to be monitored with the same intensity as we monitor Covid testing. The British Business Bank, embarrassingly minuscule compared with its foreign counterparts, needs immediately to be given the mandate and capital to increase its own lending 10 times – across the country. Bank shareholders need to declare much more publicly and vocally than they have that they understand the demands being made.Nor can the insurance industry, with funds under management of £1.9tn, stand on the sidelines. The loans the banks make, some with government guarantees, could be packaged in “cover bonds” that the insurance industry commits to buying – relieving pressure on bank balance sheets and recycling vital cash.Some companies will not need loans but equity investment: the venture capital and private equity industries must transmute themselves from their default role as predators and asset-sweaters to long-term, patient investors – working with the newly created Future Fund to take generous equity stakes in companies in need. Supporting intellectual capital rather than seeking property collateral should become the new north star of British finance. If there is not to be a terrifying slump, the British financial and ownership system needs a revolution – and it has to take place in mere weeks.Good people abound, marginalised until now by the predominant culture of wealth extraction. They need to be unleashed. And once we get to the other side, the new systems of engagement and support need to be retained. Good, perhaps, might yet come from all this pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6c53bd8023716b4e070443362c65578c2a78aab/6_0_10655_6400/master/10655.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=f1283ca32d875ad33cb98f36b12cd956","title":"universal basic income coronavirus shocks","story":"The coronavirus crisis has put insecurity at the heart of tens of millions of livesUntil six weeks ago many hung on to the vague idea that people’s relationship with work ided them along binary lines: into winners and precarious losers “aspirational” types and those who were dependent on the state and those who had either adjusted to globalisation or were the casualties of it.But if any of this was ever true, the coronavirus crisis has surely consigned most of it to history. Insecurity is now at the heart of tens of millions of lives. Put another way, the “precariat” has suddenly expanded to denote a potentially universal condition.Late last week I chatted to people in Plymouth. Most spoke via webcam from their homes, which outwardly suggested comfort and material security. But one was a specialist in oven-cleaning and another was a plumber and heating specialist: both were waiting for chancellor Rishi Sunak’s package for self-employed people to materialise, and were deeply worried about the future. Another ran a nail and beauty business from her house and feared that even if she was eventually allowed to reopen, people might be too scared to come there. On and on they went: everyone expressing anxiety and uncertainty, thereby joining the millions of people who experienced those things long before the outbreak began.So, a familiar idea has once again returned: that of a universal basic income (or UBI), whereby all of us would be entitled to a regular payment from the state, enough to cover such basics as food and heating. Ten days ago, the left-inclined pressure group Compass organised a letter, signed by more than 100 MPs and peers from seven parties, calling for a “recovery basic income” that would be “sufficient to provide economic security”. An accompanying paper sets out the case for these short-term measures being followed by a permanent basic income – set at a starting rate of £60 a week per working-age adult and £40 per child (or £10,400 per year for a family of four), with additional unemployment, housing and disability benefits maintained. Over time, this “income floor” could rise to £100 per adult.This would obviously take a large share of public spending, but through policies such as converting the current personal tax allowance into a cash payment, UBI’s advocates insist the tax system could be remodelled to ease the cost. Besides, this might not be quite the hard sell some would suggest: after the bailing-out of the banks and the government’s munificent response to the current crisis, radical spending plans are surely not the political taboo they once were.In Scotland, the SNP is enthusiastic, reflecting a mood in some other countries pointing in a comparable direction. As if to remind us that not everyone involved has idealistic intentions, the Trump administration is currently distributing a one-off payment of $1,200 (£950) to millions of US citizens, while such forward-thinking democrats as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez make the case for an American UBI.In Spain, the governing coalition of the Socialist party and radical-left movement Podemos has pledged to introduce regular payments to its poorest citizens. Podemos has long advocated full UBI, and clearly sees this first move as a big step in that direction.As with many radical ideas, the notion of a basic income is surrounded by tensions. Aside from the cost, in societies plagued by populism and arguments about who is entitled to what, UBI would be an obvious source of conflict. Even if many people are instinctively in favour, they also worry about the visions attached to the idea – of an imagined workless society in which we all somehow get the chance to be artists and coders, usually put forward by people with apparently no grasp of the damage that inactivity can do to people (as vividly proved by lockdown). For that reason, some people are keener on the idea of universal basic services, with legal entitlements to core things such as housing, education and transport. But this seems like a false choice: if we are going to maximise our collective resilience, we should surely consider both.The centrality to human wellbeing of work will remain the dangers of simply surrendering to the supposed inevitabilities of automation are obvious. But right now we need to think hard about a set of realities that the 20th century did not prepare us for. This crisis is likely be repeated. Covid-19, after all, is just the latest sign of the horrors let loose by human incursion into parts of the natural world. Even once the current disaster is somehow dealt with, the catastrophe of climate change – which itself increases the danger of disease, as tropical illnesses start to threaten new places – will speed on. This latest economic crash arrives only 12 years after the last one. We live, in short, in an age of ongoing shocks, and it is time we began to prepare.As and when that happens, debates about how to change what we get from the state will only be one part of the conversation. As the public response to this crisis proves, another key aspect of our changed reality is the amazing amount of local self-help the outbreak has triggered, and how important it is that this does not disappear.But if you are going to enable people to care for their family, friends and neighbours and involve themselves in their community, many of them will need the freedom to do the kind of work that currently brings no financial reward.

If unprecedented times demand drastic answers, isn’t this where we should begin?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd33430f16d321c4f5ebc3be89a4e813905d23be/0_61_1713_1027/master/1713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436d32de358e40faff42cd7b74083d83","title":"we must honour those brave souls working with ricky gervais","story":"The people caught up in the terrible disaster of the Wokefinder’s new series deserve our deepest sympathyEvery Tuesday at 8.45pm, I stand in the silent lane alone and bang my Le Creusets in support of a group of brave people who must never be forgotten unsung martyrs who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves working at the very heart of a terrible unfolding disaster of an unprecedented scale – the cast of the second series of Ricky Gervais’s After Life (Netflix).Denied proper support or protection, in the form of three-dimensional characters or plausible dialogue, these simple actors, almost two of them from an ethnic minority, are forced instead to mouth lines apparently designed merely to cement public perceptions of their author’s own genius, like old beggars under sacks. And yet they solider on, the real heroes of our times, discharging their duties with professionalism and dignity, lions led by a dong. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we shall remember them.I’m joking of course! But should anything be off-limits for humour, especially during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Bat and Pangolin Snack ™ ® Co Ltd)? It’s a question answered by Ricky Gervais himself in a syndicated Press Association interview provided free to the Aberdeen Evening Express, and newspapers nationwide, in March. The “Wokefinder General” (Sarah Vine, Daily Mail) concluded: “There is no better tool to get you through bad things… than with a sense of humour.” I am sure this was a sentiment shared privately by his cast every day during the filming of After Life (Netflix).If nothing should be off-limits for humour, especially during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Bat and Pangolin Smoothies and ’Shakes ™ ® Co Ltd), then is it acceptable to joke that After Life (Netflix) is the first successful post-truth TV programme? Manifestly ill-equipped to fulfil its chosen function, mixing callous cruelty with saccharine sentimentality, claiming it was only joking whenever its intentions are questioned, and buoyed artificially by the support of a loyal Twitter following and its attendant algorithmic significance, After Life (Netflix) is the sociopathic Donald Trump (Fox News) of comedy dramas. But at least After Life (Netflix) hasn’t recommended drinking Dettol (Reckitt Benckiser Group plc).But is it appropriate to laugh at Donald Trump (Fox News) during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Battered Bat and Pangolin Fingers ™ ® Inc)? Did the time for laughing end when Donald Trump (Fox News), who has the codes to a nuclear holocaust in his man bag, recommended the ingestion of cleaning fluids? Was this in fact the time for the world to collectively crap its pants and cry, instead of laughing and carrying on?I’m joking of course! Nothing should be off-limits for humour, even during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Bat and Pangolin Party Bites ™ ® Ltd)!! People should, and indeed must, be free to enjoy the Wokefinder’s After Life (Netflix) if they wish to do so, irrespective of the opinions of the gatekeepers of the temples of culture. And, in the same way, people should also be free to drink or mainline cleaning fluid if they so desire, whatever the so-called “cleaning fluid manufacturers” of the liberal elite and their gender-fluid friends say.Vice-president Mike Pence (The Koch Network) explained that he was the only one not wearing a mask when touring a coronavirus clinic because he wanted to be able to look medical workers in the eye. But medical masks cover the mouth, not the eyes and thus would not prevent eye-to-eye contact. All the medical mask would do is prevent Mike Pence (The Koch Network) from thanking medical workers by kissing them full on the mouth, and then gratefully tonguing them to climax.Perhaps Mike Pence (The Koch Network) is confusing medical masks with the full-head rubber gimp mask he is forced to wear during his private Oval Office meetings with Donald Trump (Fox News). Nothing should be off limits for humour, but is it appropriate to joke that Mike Pence (The Koch Network) is regularly sodomised by Donald Trump (Fox News) while wearing a rubber gimp mask, especially during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Bat and Pangolin Home Masseuses ™ ® Ltd)? Or will it seem like a distasteful joke when this actually turns out to have been the case, and that the Russians have it on film?It is worth remembering this. That which does not kill us makes us stronger, but that which does kill us actually does kills us. Dead! And Dettol (Reckitt Benckiser Group plc), whether drunk or injected, will kill you, even if you drink or inject it sarcastically, having been recommended to drink or inject it in a “sarcastic” way by the leader of the free world.But is it appropriate to be sarcastic during the horror of The Corona Virus (Wuhan Bat and Pangolin Escort Service ™ ® Intl)? Donald Trump (Fox News) was quick to dismiss accurate transcripts of his exact comments about how you should drink or inject Dettol (Reckitt Benckiser Group plc) as “fake news”, a concept I experienced personally myself last week for the first time when I became the subject of a failed meme attempt.A clickbait entity circulated a plausible-looking BBC news page online, featuring a photograph of “comedian” Stewart Lee claiming he wanted lockdown to last at least two years. I have never said this, but if anything I think two years isn’t long enough, and that Richard Branson’s unpaid taxes should be used to fund all British citizens’ locked-down leisure, in full, indefinitely, even after the virus is eliminated. And that every household should receive a free copy of the German experimental band Faust’s second album for Virgin, 1973’s Faust IV, so they can dream away the lotus days in a haze of fuzzy krautrock.I’m joking of course. But After Life is trending and Matt Handcock is dissembling. And a baby, a baby! Is this a civilisation that deserves to be saved?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf75efcb0af881223947644b5e65125ea6413e9/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbd27b0fc6694fc9e3f359cec9af9f85","title":"while the west fixates on covid 19 vulnerable countries pay the price","story":"The developed world’s response to the pandemic is imperilling health systems, economies and livelihoods already on the edgePeople in low-income and conflict-affected countries have so far largely escaped the high levels of Covid-19 infection seen in western Europe and the US, although this may be changing.The pandemic is killing them in different ways: lost jobs, ruined businesses, increased poverty, rising malnutrition and risk of famine, and a prospective increase in untreated, non-Covid preventable illnesses.For many of the most vulnerable, the developed world’s cures are proving worse than the disease. At the extreme, families must choose between going hungry and getting ill.And their plight is exacerbated by Covid-style “underlying conditions” – chronic, pre-existing political, security, economic, and climate problems that grow ever more unsustainable.A Covid tidal wave may be about to hit sub-Saharan Africa and other less resilient regions, the International Rescue Committee warned last week. Without urgent international action, the virus could cause 1bn infections and 3.2m deaths in 34 fragile states, including Afghanistan and Syria, it said.The World Health Organization has issued similar alerts. Yet even if these worst-case outcomes are somehow avoided, poorer countries already face enormous collateral damage.The crisis could produce famines of “biblical proportions”, with the number of people facing hunger almost doubling to more than 250 million, the World Food Programme (WFP) said. Shortfalls in donor funding and food aid meant 30 million people could die within a matter of months, it added.Yet with only 34 confirmed Covid cases so far, and no deaths, South Sudan’s main worry at present is the pandemic’s indirect impact on humanitarian aid, food supply and livelihoods.This perspective is shared by many in South Africa, the continent’s second largest economy. The official death toll is just over 100, yet the government’s lockdown is said to be costing £570m a day. Some restrictions were eased last Friday amid fears that 1.7 million people could lose the means to make a living.Looked at globally, the pandemic’s impact on jobs is devastating. The International Labour Organization reported last week that 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy – nearly half the world’s total workforce of 3.3 billion – “stand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed”.The west’s self-absorption threatens to obscure the virus’s harmful impact on treatment of non-Covid, preventable diseases. Just as UK cancer deaths are forecast to rise due to a ersion of resources, so measles and other immunisation programmes in poorer nations are being undercut.The WHO announced last week that polio vaccinations for up to 12 million children in Africa will be delayed as resources are switched to fighting Covid-19. It admitted the move would inevitably lead to more child polio cases.Disrupted vaccination programmes have frequently led to “explosive” outbreaks of life-threatening diseases previously held in abeyance, warned vaccine specialist Edward Parker. “Without systematic efforts to maintain immunisation programmes, the virus’s legacy could include a disastrous surge in childhood deaths.”The pandemic is providing cover for malign governments to pursue or accelerate policies that place lives at risk, regardless of Covid-19. A striking example is Myanmar, where the army has renewed its repression of minorities in Rakhine and Chin states.Yanghee Lee, the UN’s human rights rapporteur, said last week she feared a repeat of the alleged genocide in 2017 when 700,000 Rohingya Muslims were forced to flee. The resulting densely populated refugee camps created in next-door Bangladesh are potentially lethal Covid-19 hotspots.And Kashmir reveals more Covid collateral damage. The continuation of last year’s illegal Indian government lockdown is now justified by the need to contain the disease. Spiralling mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicide, and domestic violence, are among the results.Not to be left out, the Trump administration is ignoring a UN call to lift sanctions on struggling, virus-hit countries such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela while also blocking a global ceasefire.World Bank and IMF billions offered in assistance and debt relief to poorer countries and fragile states cannot begin to repair all this hurt. Right now, western responses to the virus are imperilling more people worldwide than the virus itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cad4274d6ffc9a3f6b37706583a32641b1c49e5/0_0_5933_3559/master/5933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48b3569d8bb5f922fc62aceb1c62b218","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of symmetry","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘symmetry’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘symmetry’.Share your photos of what symmetry means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 May at 10am.

Yet as they prepare for a phased return of pupils, many are still wrestling with the most basic practicalities.“I would struggle to get a third of the school back,” said Robin Bevan, headteacher at Southend High School for Boys, having made some rough calculations about how the current social distancing rules would work in his 1,300-pupil secondary. “You can’t come up with the solution until you know the social distancing parameters.”Ministers have said that the school return will be managed in stages, perhaps with key year groups or age cohorts returning before others. More details will be revealed this week, but scientists advising the government have been studying the possibility of rotating pupils on a “week on, week off” basis. It comes amid split scientific opinion about the role children play in spreading Covid-19.In the meantime, school leaders have been trying to be creative as they plan ahead. They have been looking at continuing some lessons online for months to come, adding extra cleaning sessions for school buildings and enforcing one-way flows through corridors for pupils returning to school where possible. However, teachers told the Observer that they kept running into fundamental problems that creativity cannot solve.“When I read about Denmark going back to school, the first thing that struck me was that many walked or cycled,” said Bevan. “That is not possible for us in the same way, with many students commuting some distance. Part of me wants to see the school reopen as soon as possible. I love it. I miss it. There’s another part that says, ‘hold on a minute – even playing with ideas around doing it is too early’.”As well as the practicalities of returning, however, teachers are also concerned about educational priorities when pupils are back.Niamh Sweeney, a sixth form teacher in Cambridge, said: “I think education as normal is a very long way off and the remote learning we’re doing now will become part of that new normal. For our students to come back, there’s the practical stuff on physical distancing, but there is also the emotional preparation. There’s no way next year’s exams should be based on the full curriculum.”Howard Payne, headteacher at Medina Primary School, near Portsmouth, said his experience so far had led to concerns about enforcing social distancing among young children.“We have only eight children at the moment, but children do gravitate to each other,” he said. “Our corridors are very narrow. We’re getting a whole host of these issues and trying to think about how to keep social distancing in place. We’re up in the air.”School meals are another issue worrying him. He said: “If it’s summer and the weather’s good, we’ve got a field. They could all separate. However, the school meals will have to start a lot earlier. You have to get the children in and out quickly, but that will be hard. Lunchtimes and playtimes are a challenge.”Such are the disruptions that teaching unions are already saying that next year’s exams will have to be remodelled. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “There’s an assumption that next year the GCSEs, A-levels and SATs will just take place in the same way as they did in 2019. I think that’s a questionable assumption. We may have to look at a different form of assessment.“Many children will be traumatised by what has happened. Some will be hungry. Somemight have been subjected to emotional or physical abuse. Some will have stressed parents, or be stressed about being in cramped accommodation. What they need is a curriculum and an experience in school that brings them back into society and learning.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are working in close consultation with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right, and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b415da4a15f718e28be6686704a62704940bfd74/0_438_2496_1496/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d433c76b6cde19231bf9258dd4d091e","title":"britt ekland on peter sellers he was a very tormented soul","story":"Married to the comedy actor in the 1960s, the former Bond girl talks for the first time about their fights and his controlling waysPeter Sellers is widely admired as a British comic genius, the creator of some of the most memorable characters of 20th-century film and broadcasting. He was central to the cult 1960s BBC programme The Goon Show, once described as “probably the most influential comedy show of all time”, while his later role as Chief Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films brought him international stardom.But in private he was a difficult, domineering and jealous man who married four times, and once said of himself: “If I can’t really find a way to live with myself, I can’t expect anyone else to live with me.” Now we have fresh testimony from one who tried – and failed.Sellers’s former wife Britt Ekland has opened up about their troubled marriage, describing Sellers – who suffered from serious ill health as well as alcohol and cocaine dependency – as deeply controlling and mentally unstable, but unable to receive the medical treatment that he would have got today, partly because he was so valuable to the studios.In a major BBC documentary, Peter Sellers: A State Of Comic Ecstasy, the former Bond actress recalls her four-year marriage from 1964.She remembers that Sellers would choose what she should wear, buying her entire wardrobe without consulting her, and threatening her with orce “every Friday night – and by Monday there would be a make-up lunch or present”.Sellers, who died in 1980, made his name, with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, through the seminal radio comedy The Goon Show. He became a global star with classic screen roles such as the inept Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther in 1963, to which he took Ekland on their first date.The couple met after he saw a photograph of the Swedish actress in a newspaper and realised that they were both staying at the Dorchester in London. In the documentary’s archive footage, Sellers says: “I thought that I would like to meet what I saw.”Ekland had come to Britain to be launched as 20th Century Fox’s new star. She recalls being in the bath when there was a knock at the door: “I wrapped a towel round me and rushed to open the door … This very tall gentleman said ‘I’m Mr Sellers’s valet’. Would I like to come to his suite?”Returning from their honeymoon, she was photographed in a fur coat: “He decided what I was going to wear. He just pre-decided everything without ever asking me.”Ekland, who went on to star in The Man With The Golden Gun, also recalls how Sellers’s actions got her fired from the 1964 film Guns at Batasi: “He called me and said, ‘Ask the production if you can have an extra day off’. And they said no. He just said that’s taken care of. Someone drove me to the airport. The next thing I know I land in California, where I’d never been before, with no clothes. The plan was I would spend the weekend and then I would fly back. When I arrived, he said, ‘I have a doctor here because you don’t look well’. The doctor said, ‘She’s suffering strain and stress. You can’t possibly go back to filming’.”Asked in the documentary whether she was ill, she exclaims: “Of course not. I was 21 years old, fit as a fiddle, but I had no choice. I couldn’t have said, ‘I’m sorry, I love you, but I’ve got to go back to work now’. There was no option for that … I was fired from the film.”She continues: “I was taken straight back to our marble palace. He took me into the bedroom, which was all gold and white, and then next to it was a walk-in closet. He’d bought everything you could possibly need as a woman who didn’t have any clothes, from evening gowns to bikinis. The bikini was actually of mink … I was floored.”Although she has previously been quoted describing her marriage as “an atrocious sham”, John O’Rourke, the documentary’s producer-director, told the Observer: “She’s always quite private about this chapter of her life because she had her first child, Victoria, with Sellers … She hasn’t gone into huge amounts of detail. There have been a lot of books and documentary films made about Sellers over the years. She refused to speak to them … She mentioned bipolar disorder. Obviously Britt’s not a medical professional. But she did live with him for four years.”In the documentary, Ekland says that when she reads her diaries she sees repeated use of the Swedish word for “fight”. She recalls an argument in Rome, after they were harassed by paparazzi: “He just went on and on … This continued all night and he took my radio and smashed it. In the end he called our agent and said, ‘Come and pick her up’. I knew that this time I could never go back.”The tragedy is that Sellers brought out so much of life’s funny side. In the documentary, one of Milligan’s children recalls: “Dad would have to lie down on his bed to talk to Peter because they’d be laughing so much.”But Sellers’s grandson Will says: “The sad thing is that, like a lot of comedians, happiness eluded him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

But then, just before I brought it to the table, I melted a generous slice of butter in a small pan and threw in a few flaked almonds with which to toss the hot couscous. The warm golden fat trickled through the grains and along with the crackling nuts turned a humble supper into a quietly luxurious one.I have been keeping my shopping lists short. While the stores are mercifully uncrowded at the moment, shopping has turned briefly from a pleasure into something I no longer wish to take my time over. I’m in and out in a heartbeat. With flour, butter, eggs and jam already in the cupboard, I had only to pick up a couple of tubs of ricotta to assemble the ingredients for a glorious tart to eat after dinner, finishing it the next day for breakfast. There were never any rules anyway, but with the world currently turned upside down, if I want to eat pudding for breakfast, then I shall…Stirring steaming grains of couscous into a few spring vegetables is a neat way of making a meagre amount of broad beans and asparagus go further.

Cut the asparagus into pieces the length of a wine cork. Salt the water in one pan lightly, then add the asparagus and cook for 4-6 minutes, depending on the thickness of their stalks.In the other pan, place a fine mesh colander over the water and pour in the couscous. Cover and steam until the grains are soft and fluffy, about 20 minutes.Make the dressing by whisking together the olive oil and lemon juice. Squash the garlic flat and add it to the dressing, then season with salt and black pepper.When the asparagus is tender, remove with a slotted spoon and drain, then add to the dressing and set aside.Cook the broad beans in the boiling asparagus water for 6-8 minutes, then drain. While the beans are cooking, remove the herb leaves from their stalks (you need about 25g in total) and chop them, then add to the dressing.Pop the broad beans out of their skins by pressing them between finger and thumb (if your beans are very small and young, you probably don’t need to do this). Add the beans to the other ingredients.Remove the couscous from the heat and break the grains up with a fork. Tip the couscous into the other ingredients and toss everything together. Transfer to a serving dish. In a small pan, melt the butter, add the almonds and lightly brown them, then pour the nuts and hot butter over the couscous.Keep a close eye on the filling’s progress in the oven, removing it once the outer edge is lightly firm and the inner part still quivers when the tart is gently shaken. The vanilla extract plays a crucial part, go for the very best. You will also need a 20cm loose-bottomed tart tin.Serves 6For the pastry:butter 90gplain flour 150gegg yolk 1water 1-2 tbspFor the filling:lemon 1, largeorange 1, smallricotta 500gcaster sugar 150gvanilla extract 1 tsp, to tasteeggs 3egg yolk 1cornflour 1 tbspFor the top:apricot jam 370gpine kernels 2 tbspMake the pastry by reducing the butter and flour to fine crumbs in a food processor. Add the egg yolk and enough of the water to produce a firm but tender dough. Form a ball, wrap it in greaseproof paper and set aside in the fridge to rest for about 30 minutes.Roll the pastry out thinly, then use it to line the tart tin. Place a piece of baking parchment or foil on top of the pastry and fill to the brim with baking beans. Set aside in the fridge for 30 minutes.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Heat a baking sheet, then bake the tart on it for 25 minutes. Remove the paper and beans then return the tart case to the oven for a few minutes until the pastry is dry to the touch. Remove the case from the oven and lower the heat to 180Cgas mark 4.Grate the zest of the lemon and orange on a fine-toothed grater.Mix together the ricotta, sugar and vanilla. Beat the eggs and egg yolk together with a fork, then add to the ricotta with the lemon zest and vanilla extract. Stir in the cornflour then pour into the tart case and return to the oven for 40 minutes. When the filling appears to be almost set (it should wobble when gently shaken), remove and allow to cool.Melt the apricot jam in a small saucepan, then spoon over the tart. Toast the pine kernels in a shallow pan until golden, then scatter over the jam.

He describes how Wayne Rooney stood out from “the first training session” to such a degree that the Italian had to have a stern word with himself: he hadn’t moved to England to stand around admiring his teammates in training he had to make an impression himself.Then he pauses and says: “There was another player who really impressed me …” and his mind wanders back to the day when a certain teenager trained with the first team for the first time. The kid in question blew Darmian away. “I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.”In Darmian’s mind there is no limit to what Rashford can achieve if he stays fit and continues to develop. “If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappé and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come.”Darmian is back in Italy now, with Parma, having moved back to Serie A in August last year in search of more first-team football. He looks back at his time at United fondly, though, having made 92 appearances for the club. The Italian full-back was a surprise acquisition for Louis van Gaal’s United in 2015. Few in England had heard of the former Milan academy player, although he had starred in Italy’s 2-1 win against England in Manaus at the 2014 World Cup.His first season at United was the most successful one, from a personal point of view, as he made 28 league appearances and won the FA Cup, having come on as a substitute in the 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace, and he says his time at the club was “an amazing adventure that stays with you for the rest of your life”.When we speak on WhatsAppZoomtelephone it is clear how much representing United and playing at Old Trafford meant to the 30-year-old, who is currently waiting for the Serie A season to start up again. “I’ll be honest and say that I remember my first game for United being an incredible emotion,” he says. “I felt like a child. Old Trafford is something fantastic, there’s a reason that it’s called the theatre of dreams. My debut was perfect because we beat Tottenham at home and I heard the fans screaming my name: a wonderful feeling. I felt a lot of pride but also the responsibility to play for one of the best clubs in the world.”Darmian’s main regret is not winning the league title with United during his time at the club but he did add the Europa League to that FA Cup victory and says that, while there was pressure to win things at the club, it was never made oppressive. “When you play for Manchester United you just have one objective: to win as much as possible. It’s too big of a club to think in any different way.“We felt a responsibility to win and there was the pressure to go back to a certain level. But that’s normal for a top club and the directors never made it a burden: everyone wanted to win the Premier League, it’s normal when you are at Manchester United.”Darmian played for Van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at United and is in no doubt that the Norwegian is the right person to take United forward, despite not being given many chances to shine under the former United striker’s reign. “I can only speak well about Solksjær, believe me,” Darmian says. “I would give him a long-term contract. He’s a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project. Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjær has success at the club.”United have gone from winning the league regularly to suffering from inconsistency after Sir Alex Ferguson left the club. During Darmian’s time they finished fifth, sixth, second and sixth. Players, like the managers, have come and gone and many have struggled to settle, leading to criticism of not only those players but also the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward.One of those players is Paul Pogba, brought back to United after four years at Juventus, for a world record £89.3m, in a summer in which the club also signed Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Darmian knows Pogba well and is confident he will return to the level that made United sign him in the first place.“Did I see Pogba unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn’t see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there. He really cares about doing well at Manchester United.”Darmian has been back in Italy for nine months now, seeing some of his former teammates, such as Romelu Lukaku, who is at Internazionale, and Chris Smalling (Roma) excel at their clubs. His own club, Parma, are ninth and aiming for a place in Europe when football restarts. “I was lucky I could join Parma. Their sporting director, Daniele Faggiano, called me and enabled me to return to Serie A, a league I knew well. I joined a good group of people and that always helps with everything.At the moment we are still focused on avoiding relegation, that is the main objective. But it’s an ambitious club and that’s what convinced me to pick Parma so who knows what we can achieve. As for the national team, playing in the Euros in 2021 for Italy is something I want to do at all cost.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200430-55296-gnl.fw.200430.jf.SpainFranceupdate.mp3 For now though, everything in Italy, as in the rest of the world, focuses on coronavirus. Italy is one of the worst hit countries in the world and football has become insignificant for the time being. “It’s a very complicated situation unfortunately,” Darmian says.” I’m spending the quarantine at home like everyone else. With my family and our young child which always keeps us busy, so we are never bored. We have a balcony, so we can go out and get some fresh air when the weather permits it.“Will Serie A be able to finish or will the season be voided? Well, now the most important thing is health and we must focus on that rather than the league. Everything else comes after that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19d7e8192d9b21fdf8a959ec4172e52e0979099/65_226_5407_3244/master/5407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7f5e11b67a9b7ac51ce60155470202","title":"real madrid lucas vazquez interview","story":"The winger on taking penalties, learning English and his journey from a tiny town to winning three Champions League titles“It’s a strange feeling,” Lucas Vázquez says. “We’re used to competing, training, travelling, being together every day: 30 people, all the time. And then, overnight, you’re on your own.” On 12 March the Real Madrid basketball player Trey Thompkins tested positive for Covid-19. The football team had just turned up, but they did not head on to the field that morning. Instead, the club’s Valdebebas HQ was closed and they were sent home.Seven weeks later, they are still there. Like everyone in Spain, they are in lockdown and Vázquez’s hair is longer than it has been for ages. For weeks no one has been out except to walk the dog. “By the third day the dog’s saying: ‘I need a day off,’” the Madrid winger says with a laugh. Next came the kids, released last weekend. And finally, this weekend, adults will get out. It is only an hour but it is something. Testing of players begins this week, a gradual return to training the week after. That, at least, is the plan.“Good news,” Lucas says. “Bit by bit, numbers drop, and there’s hope we can get back to normal.” Until then there are home sessions – “Madrid send daily routines so the loss of group sessions has as little an impact as possible” – books on nutrition, series on TV, and above all “my son, who won’t leave me alone: I’m enjoying that part of it.” There are also English classes.“I have a basis already and I watch series in English, read a bit, study grammar. I’ve been doing it for a year and a half,” he says. Good enough to have this conversation? “If you want my answers to be ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” he says with a laugh, which he does often. An entertaining, unexpectedly relaxed hour flies by, looking back on a journey from a tiny town to the biggest club on earth and three European Cups. “Never in my wildest dreams looking back, it doesn’t seem possible.”He is the most successful person to have come out of Curtis, that is for sure. Wikipedia’s entry on the little Galician town lists two illustrious inhabitants, one of which is San Pedro de Mezonzo, and that was 1,000 years ago. Vázquez cracks up again. “There’s a couple of people who’ve done well, but I don’t think there’s anyone with three Champions Leagues. There are 2,000 people and everyone knows everyone else, the typical small town with farms and things.” And a restaurant opened by his grandparents and run by his dad’s twin brother. There’s another grin, another giggle. “The best restaurant in Spain, basically.”Dani Carvajal, Nacho and Casemiro remain from those early days. Álvaro Morata was there, too. There was also a certain Liverpool midfielder. Vázquez laughs. “Fabinho came as a right-back. IHe played the whole season there. At first he found it hard to adapt, but he was a very good player. You could see he had things.”So did Vázquez. “There are few players who play on their natural foot as a winger,” he says, “so you could call me a pure or classic winger, I suppose.” Like a throwback, something from the 70s or 80s? “Well,” he says, with a grin, “I like this football. The pitches are better, for a start. You don’t see those mud baths any more.” Quite English, then? Might that suit? Might the timing, even? Aged 28, he has 18 months left on his contract. So what next? “The dream is to retire at Madrid but in football you don’t know. When I was little, I always watched the Premier League with my brother. It was, it is, very attractive: a nice football to play, one that could fit my characteristics and personality well.”The personality, especially. With Vázquez, it always feels like that defines him, a player as much about temperament as talent, a career built on conviction as well as quality: quietly determined and hard-working, never a word out of line. Quite Galician, although Santi Solari once observed: “Lucas has the virtues I most appreciate in the Spanish character: solidarity and bravery.” As for Zinedine Zidane, he turns to Vázquez again and again. “He’s transparent: good or bad, he tells you to your face, always,” Vázquez says.“Saying something into a microphone doesn’t gain you anything, but that doesn’t mean I won’t turn up the next day and say: ‘Hey, I want to play.’ And the mental side of the game is so important. People sometimes complain and it can feel like they think we want to lose. We’re not machines where one plus one is always two. At 22, 23, if I played badly, I’d be pissed off for a day, two days. But over the years you learn. It doesn’t help to constantly think about it. You have to know what you did wrong, sure, but ask yourself: why? Improve it, move on. You have to live with pressure.”Pressure? If there is an image of Vázquez, repeated often, it is the moment he walked to the penalty spot at the end of the Champions League final against Atlético Madrid in 2016 spinning the ball on his finger as if he did not have a care in the world. “Tell the truth, I wasn’t crapping myself, because I didn’t really know what was at stake. People ask me why I wanted to take the penalty. I was convinced I would score and I thought: ‘Why not?’ On the walk from the centre, I was thinking: ‘Put it in, put it in, put it in.’”Did you know which way you would shoot? “Not entirely. I like to wait ...”You depend on the goalkeeper moving? “Yeah, a bit.”And if he doesn’t? Vázquez laughs again. “Hit it hard and hope it goes in.”It did. It still seems impossible, he says. “Three Champions Leagues, a league title. Unbelievable. And I’d love to do it again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3554bc82ed41286990590549d4fcf77635dec0/5_0_2626_1577/master/2626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0be9d154a0297119987c0f3e464a77","title":"unbelievable remembering luis suarezs liverpool goal v newcastle","story":"José Enrique assisted the sublime strike in 2012 and still cannot believe what his former teammate, and friend, pulled off “Unbelievable,” José Enrique says for the umpteenth time as we speak, like many are doing right now, on Zoom. There is a great, necessary distance between us – he in Valencia, me in Beckenham – but Enrique’s words come through loud and clear, and that one in particular. It is used often and is apt given our conversation centres on something that happened more than seven years ago but still feels, well … unbelievable.A special goal by a special player – Luis Suárez. Enrique’s face lights up at the mere mention of the forward he played alongside at Liverpool, with the Spaniard’s mood only darkening as he talks about the incidents that “killed” Suárez’s time in England. But overall the memories are positive – off the pitch Enrique and Suárez became friends while on it they formed a strong and productive relationship, seen most brilliantly on a cold Sunday afternoon in November 2012.Newcastle United, the team Enrique had left in order to join Liverpool 15 months earlier, were the visitors to Anfield. They were in decent form but so too were the hosts, a young, dynamic side under a young dynamic manager in Brendan Rodgers. And they began well, dominating possession and chances. Cue shock, then, when Newcastle took the lead through Yohan Cabaye’s drive from an acute angle two minutes before half-time. It was a body blow for Liverpool and they needed a response, which they got on 67 minutes – a goal from Suárez, and perhaps the best he ever scored for the club.That may be deemed a wild overstatement given the array of goals Suárez struck during his three-and-a-half years in a red shirt. It is hard to pick a winner, and that’s just from those against Norwich. But the one he put past Newcastle really was something else. “The touch of a genius,” was how Martin Tyler described it in commentary while from Enrique, who made it possible with a long pass from left-back, comes particularly striking praise: “It is one of the best goals I’ve ever seen from any player.”Enrique’s role in the goal should not be overlooked. Having seized possession midway inside Liverpool’s half, he sent forward a delivery that had the required height, weight and distance to clear Newcastle’s midfield and then, crucially, their centre-backs, Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor, as Suárez darted between them. Yet there was still a lot for the Uruguayan to do as the ball dropped towards him just inside the area at the Kop end. It was coming at speed and he had to collect it side-on and on the move while also dealing with Coloccini pressed up against his back. Most players would have stumbled and fumbled. But Suárez isn’t most players.Instead he perfectly cushioned Enrique’s pass on a patch of body between his left shoulder and chest and then adjusted his frame so in one smooth movement, and practically in mid-air, he was now front on, allowing him to not only block Coloccini from getting to the ball but take it around the oncoming Tim Krul before prodding a shot into the net with the same foot. From start to finish the technique was sublime – a piece of performance art amid the crashing intensity of a Premier League encounter – and for the man who instigated it there was an instant sense that something special had happened.“I knew it was an unbelievable goal because of where Luis was when I passed to him and where he ended up, but I didn’t realise just how unbelievable it was until I saw it on TV later,” says Enrique. “People see Luis and think he is this crazy guy who is running and pushing all the time but one of the reasons he is a top striker is because of the calm he shows under pressure. You see that with this goal how he controls the ball, keeps it away from Coloccini and then has the tranquility to realise he needs to go around the goalkeeper to score. He makes it look simple, but it is not simple.”During Suárez’s celebrations he can be seen pointing towards Enrique in a show of recognition for the assist that led to his third goal in three games. Rightly so, yet for the defender the moment was more one of relief than joy given he had not been having the best of games. “I always felt weird playing against Newcastle, maybe because they were my old club,” says Enrique. “But me and Luis had a very good understanding on the pitch – a connection – and even if I was playing bad I always felt I could find him.The game ended 1-1 and that assist would ultimately be the second of six Enrique provided for Suárez before the Uruguayan’s £75m transfer to Barcelona in July 2014. He left having regularly dazzled for Liverpool, no more so than during the 2013-14 season, scoring 31 times as the team came painfully close to the Premier League title while he was named double footballer of the year. But there was also disgrace to contend with – racism and, on two occasions, bites, with the one inflicted on Giorgio Chiellini during that summer’s World Cup proving the final straw for many.Enrique, who himself left Liverpool in May 2016 and now works as an agent and TV pundit in Spain having successfully undergone surgery for a brain tumour, does not excuse Suárez’s misdemeanours but insists they are not wholly reflective of the man he got to know on Merseyside. “I still have a good friendship with Luis and anyone who knows him will tell you he’s a top, top guy,” says the 34-year-old.“Luis has always been like that, he’s an unbelievable person, but when he gets on the pitch he becomes very competitive – winning is everything and that caused him to make mistakes. He killed himself in England. I cannot explain what he did.”What is for sure is that Suárez, now aged 33 and in his sixth and potentially final season at Barcelona, has been one of the most gifted talents of his generation. As far as Enrique is concerned he has only been bettered by two others – Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – while his contribution for Liverpool was on a level that even the current crop have yet to match.“Sadio Mané is my favourite Liverpool player and I believe Jordan Henderson should be named player of the year, but neither of them, or anyone in this team, has been as important for Liverpool as Luis was,” Enrique says. “In the season we nearly won the league he changed games on his own. He was unplayable and scored some amazing goals.”He also scored some amazing goals prior to that campaign – one against Newcastle, especially. “For sure,” agrees Enrique with a nod and a smile. “It was unbelievable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2767b6f15b2aacbd13088cadbe86c9a6ba139040/0_1996_6300_3776/master/6300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b8a21e67c36f8927a18a1644dc7c569","title":"why its good to be bored","story":"Nothing to do? Frustrated? Can’t summon the energy for even the smallest task? Fret not, says Elle Hunt. There’s a point to boredom, and it can offer us a chance to shape our own livesI remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum’s friend’s house, into which she had disappeared. “Won’t be long,” she’d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag – minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.I was in trouble, of course – but I was not convinced that I’d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice – and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.I did not understand then – two decades before my first conference call or doctor’s waiting room – that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one’s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present – evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a “boom time for boredom”. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. “I think that’s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don’t think you do.”Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that – in trying to outrun it my entire life – I had been refusing to heed.What if I stopped and listened?Danckert is an Australian cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of “physician, heal thyself,” he says. “As a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.”This isn’t a new phenomenon. To quote from Boredom: A Lively History, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: “How long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?” In the Middle Ages monks complained of “the noonday demon”: the personification of acedia – torpor, alongside agitation – provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be “a bore”, it was Dickens who was the first to term it “boredom” – in Bleak House in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being “bored to death” of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (“I’m just about starving tonight”) evokes Tolstoy’s definition in Anna Karenina of the feeling as “the desire for desires”.“Boredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,” says Eastwood, who is head of the Boredom Lab at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives – from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention – with a view to applying their findings in the real world. “But as a scientist, I wasn’t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.”Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming “crisis of agency” among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a “failure to launch into life”, which these men told him they experienced as “being chronically bored”. But what was being bored, exactly? “I thought: what is this?”In Out of My Skull, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of “wanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything”. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. “Only boring people get bored,” goes the aphorism. “I’m highly motivated to prove it’s not true,” jokes Danckert.It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner Anne Enright wrote recently: “Boredom is a productive state, so long as you don’t let it go sour on you.” It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren’t. Complaints of “I’m bored” are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. “There is this impulse in us to say, ‘There’s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.’ But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there’s things to do – but they can’t bring their desires in the moment in line with what’s there.”Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In Out of My Skull, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia’s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not “even want to look out of a porthole”. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield’s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored – but, Danckert says, it’s more that “he just deals with it really very well”.In the years after I tore apart Mum’s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea.On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy) and when I ran out of other people’s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth – while simultaneously a source of distress for many.The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor.Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism. To Danckert, that means boredom may be one part of our ever more polarised politics and public discourse. “When you’re in the midst of an overload of information, one response is to shout louder,” he says. Sociologist Orrin Klapp, writing in 1986, called it “ego-screaming” and that “perfectly captures Twitter trolling,” says Danckert.The fact that our response to boredom is often destructive, adversarial or otherwise problematic speaks to just how deeply uncomfortable we find the sensation. A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes.“All too often when we’re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill – we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,” says Eastwood. “But it doesn’t foster and grow our capacity for agency – and that’s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.”Danckert and Eastwood are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone. But it is true that tech presents us with a powerful distraction. If the goal is to simply avoid being bored, it may be easier now than ever, what with the infinite scroll of social media, endless hours of entertainment on Netflix and Spotify, and all our friends always available.But this over-abundance of things to do itself can exacerbate boredom. Eastwood evokes the “paradox of choice”, saying “options are not necessarily freeing and do not necessarily make us happy”. Seeking relief on the internet “can feel like trying to drink from a fire hose” Danckert and Eastwood write. Not only that, in hijacking our attention, technology may, over time, compound the issue it seems to alleviate. “It takes time and attention to scroll through Instagram or play Candy Crush, but at the end of it, you’re not satisfied, because you didn’t do the harder work of figuring out: ‘What do I really want to do?’ It’s a vicious cycle: you got some engagement, but it wasn’t the thing you needed,” says Danckert. That is the challenge that boredom lays down, he says: “to figure out what is going to be meaningful and useful to you in your life”.Becoming better attuned to our own inner states can allay the discomfort and illuminate a satisfying course of action. Mindfulness, which fosters a non-judgmental response to one’s thoughts (as I now know I practised on my parents’ boat), has been linked to lower levels of boredom. Danckert lets his mind wander on his three-mile walk to work , thinking of “the dumbest things – but it is engaging to just follow those threads and see where they lead you”.Eastwood’s own ritual is making time to sit and think, with a cup of tea – a period of “constructive internal reflection”, during which he connects with his internal compass. Uncomfortable feelings steer us for the better, he says. “Just as it’s good that we have the capacity for pain, to keep us safe, it’s good that we have the capacity for boredom, because it saves us from the ruin of stagnation. It keeps us moving forward and searching for a better way of applying ourselves, for engaging in the world.”Received in that spirit, boredom can be a call to action – but many of us choose not to hear it. Wincing, I admit to Danckert that I have opened Twitter, scrolled for a while, become bored with scrolling, closed Twitter, then immediately opened Twitter again, almost instinctively. I do this embarrassingly often, I tell him – it’s just easier to push through boredom on the internet, rather than taking it as a cue to log off.Danckert reiterates, not without sympathy, I think, that at moments like that it is better to “just do something”. It does not necessarily have to align with some higher purpose in life – simply putting down my phone will break the cycle of unsatisfying engagement, and reinforce my own sense of my autonomy.Within weeks of our interview, a global pandemic takes hold, and I count myself lucky to just be bored. Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over. I spend less time on my phone. I read my flatmate’s books that have rested on our communal shelf for years without ever piquing my curiosity. I bake, for the first time since childhood. Constraints that might have been boring are in fact oddly motivational.As Danckert and Eastwood write in Out of My Skull, when we are “constantly carried along by a fast-moving stream, we can forget how to swim for ourselves”. It is this that boredom seeks to remind us of, they suggest – that we are the authors of our lives, even now they’ve been derailed.1. Don’t fight the feeling. Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle – you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.2. Create a new routine. Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear – one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.3. Find purpose. Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason “why” for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what’s really important – whether right now, or for the future.4. Avoid passive consumption. It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you’re enjoying yourself, there’s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.Out of My Skull (Harvard University Press, £22.95) is out in June.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

Here’s what we’ve learnt so far…Online school has started again. Joyous day! My fresh-faced poppets are keen, ready for their young minds to be moulded and expanded. Yes there are challenges, but we are ready to meet them. The world is a great big classroom! “Mummy,” they say, eagerly, big eyes bright with excitement, textbooks piled neatly in front of them. “We just want to learn.”Of course they say nothing of the sort: the younger doesn’t say anything. He keeps himself to a strict 20 words per parent per day regime in normal times and has maintained that discipline now. I don’t actually know where the elder is. Maybe he’s trying to stream Ozark next to the rock that gets a weak 4G signal, or waging war on the slugs devouring his seedlings? We’ve all become adept at keeping out of each other’s way over the past six weeks – ships that pass in the kitchen.They are both in exam years and the confusing government guidance gives few clues about how to approach this weird time. It’s too late to raise your grade, or perhaps it isn’t? You might want to retake anyway, so keep working. They should have been on study leave, which would have been a colour-coded, index card-strewn stress-fest, but this shapelessness is worse, I think, because there’s no clear end point. “All of the boredom of school holidays, without any of the actual holidays,” says a friend.There is help out there. The headline that Danny Dyer is teaching Tudor history to tinies on the BBC is enormously pleasing (I might watch myself), but he’s just a small part of a learning-support package that gives the glib “public service broadcasting” label real meaning. Apparently, there’s content for GCSE and A-level students on BBC4 in the evenings, but nobody seems keen. If we manage a question apiece on University Challenge, that passes for education.There are other things I am grateful for, including not being on the other side of the screen for a start. Imagine being a teacher now, trying to educate 25 boredom-maddened and anxious teenagers online. I find a 15-minute Skype call draining. Worse still, imagine trying to conjure grades that will have a real impact on young people’s future from some hastily assembled flat-pack assessment system. Reports that schools have been bombarded by pleas from parents trying to wangle better grades for their darlings only make it more unenviable.I’m grateful, too, that given their ages, I’m not expected to facilitate my children’s learning – a mercy for both them and me. That doesn’t stop me offering the odd helpful suggestion. I forward all the “I saw Goody Proctor in the non-essentials aisle of Asda” memes I spot to the younger, who is studying The Crucible. My daily walk brings fresh learning material. “There’s a dead buzzard in the field!” I announce on my return. “Perhaps we could bring it home and you could dissect it?”“I don’t think so,” says the elder. He is also damning of my suggestion that he “make yeast”, gesturing bleakly at the admittedly unpromising contents of the kitchen. A friend is enjoying online life drawing, so I suggest it as a complement to trying to paint with the three cans of ancient emulsion he unearthed. He’s not keen.Even with the internet back, we’re constantly squabbling for bandwidth as I work and they try to study (the younger – also in pyjamas – trudges in wordlessly to show me the confusing mess on his screen). My husband doesn’t have much work, which means he is de facto technical support, a thankless task. It’s tense, so for light relief we read the school’s email about PE during lockdown, laugh heartily and delete it (sorry, school).We’re all just making the best of a bad job, I suppose. A home-educating mate reminds me this is light years away from what she does in normal circumstances. How little home ed is confined to the home and how incompatible an education system based on learning outcomes and assessment is with millions of confused and anxious kids and parents thrown back on their own scant resources. That doesn’t mean this time can’t be educational, in the wider sense. We’ll all have learned something by the time it’s over: pest control, buzzard decomposition, the intimate workings of the home hub and the Succession theme tune on the piano respectively.Maybe we’ll eventually learn patience, acceptance and a sense that there’s more to life than grades?

Try distracting yourself with online dates, box sets and classic novelsThe dilemma Several months ago my partner of five years left me very suddenly. He’d gone abroad to work, but as far as I knew everything was fine. I even had flights booked to go and visit. The break-up was a huge shock that left me in a low place. After a few weeks I felt I was beginning to come out of the fog and start moving on with my life, going out and seeing friends, going to classes, etc, but then the lockdown was imposed. Being shut away in my flat all day, alone with my thoughts, I seem to be going backwards.I’m very aware that we are in the middle of a global crisis and it’s awful for everyone. Luckily, I’m in a good position regarding pay and I’m not paying rent, so I really don’t have any reason to complain. However, all I can think about is my ex. It’s driving me a little bit mad. Do you have any advice on dealing with non-Covid-related troubles during this crisis? Talking to others about it is hard, and I don’t want to make it all about myself.Mariella replies That’s a pandemic for you! This insidious, headline-hungry virus doesn’t detract from the very real dilemmas that each of us will be confronting, but it does reduce our airtime for complaint. Big issues, such as how to survive economically and even physically, can be a compelling distraction from more mundane meditations, but that doesn’t make the minutiae of daily existence any less of a hardship. I’ve noticed that the less stress-inducing activity there is going on in our lives, the faster smaller concerns expand to fit the allotted space.The enormity of Covid-19 fears may dwarf our day-to-day dilemmas, but it doesn’t make what we are feeling any less relevant or painful. For some people, their biggest issues lie within their own four walls (the rise in domestic violence is a particular concern), for others the dangers are less immediate. Either way, few are entirely carefree.Whether it’s regrets and fears, vivid dreams or sudden contact from the very-much-alive ghosts of our past, this virus is playing as much havoc with our subconscious as it is with the economy. The mental flotsam and jetsam bobbing by in the deep of night – and even in our daydreams – can be overwhelming.It’s been fascinating to watch the highlights reel of my five-plus decades played out in my mind during these weeks of isolation. I presume I’m not alone in waking up from unexpected erotic nightmares or moments of particular passion or pain, dreams of contagion and euphoria, angst over abandoned friendships and pernicious thoughts about those lost over the years… I’m getting more sleep than usual, but I’m not sure it’s what you’d describe as restful as my mind relentlessly pounds the pavements of my past.Dreams during lockdown feel more like they spring from the imaginations of the likes of JG Ballard and Isabel Allende – not little old humdrum me. The sheer unexpected nature of where my unconscious takes off to is unsettling in itself. Daytime, too, with so many manual chores and so little mental stimulation, is provoking all kinds of extraordinary and unexpected emotional memory drifts. I’m sure I’m not alone in hearing from people I thought I’d never see again and, as a result, am reliving events I’d presumed were firmly consigned to the past.Thoughts of your ex are surfacing just as they might be expected to, and without the distraction of daily life it’s hard to shrug off such melancholic meanderings.I heard an item the other day about online dating, where even the dates are now happening via apps and on other platforms. It seems to me an excellent way to distract yourself. Either you will end up with a tale to recount to your friends that will amuse and distract you all or, as you check out prospective candidates, you might even find one worth downloading into your real-world contacts to be pursued when the lockdown is over.Being preoccupied with thoughts of your ex is predictable and unavoidable, but minimising the time you have to languish over them is in your power. There are three seasons of Ozark to watch, five of Peaky Blinders, there are documentaries on plastic in our oceans and Trump’s rise to power. There’s the pulse-racing dramatisation of Jeanine Cummins’s American Dirt to listen to on BBC Sounds, and a whole eternity of other books that you can finally get around to reading.My go-to tomes for romantic possibility are from the Australian writer Tim Winton, but Ann Patchett does a good line in the triumph of hope over adversity, too. Limit the time for thoughts of your ex and you’ll gradually reduce his hold on your imagination.A few months is a short time to recover from five years together, so look on lockdown as an opportunity to heal and don’t battle too hard against thoughts that will eventually fade. Our brains are in some ways similar to our bodies. We can’t remake them, but we can certainly train them to behave better. Try disciplining and inspiring yours to be a little less active where lost love is concerned and more proactive about where you’re off to next.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Some of the items are now in short supply.Since the programme aired, a number of NHS workers who were interviewed for it were reported to be either longstanding members or supporters of the Labour party.Dowden also referred to another recent incident in which the BBC admitted it had made a mistake by reporting that a boss of an NHS trust had contacted the broadcaster with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff during the coronavirus crisis.“I am sure you will agree that it is vital that public confidence is maintained in the BBC’s longstanding reputation for fair and balanced reporting, and that any damage to that would be deeply concerning,” wrote Dowden.The minister also said he was aware the Panorama programme had been the subject of a number of complaints to the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom.“Concerns have been raised that a disproportionate number of those interviewed in the programme were political activists or had clear links to a political party. This both was not made clear to viewers and does not reflect the balance of views of an institution as large as the NHS,” he wrote in the letter, excerpts of which have been published by the Mail on Sunday.A spokesperson for the BBC confirmed on Sunday that it had received Dowden’s letter, adding it would respond in due course. It referred to a statement issued last week that said sources for its PPE revelations were not the doctors who appeared on the show.The BBC’s journalists had spoken to dozens of healthcare workers in the course of making the programme, some of whom were members of a political party and some not, it said.Given that NHS trusts had discouraged healthcare workers from discussing the lack of PPE, the statement said it was perhaps not surprising that those willing to speak out were more involved with campaigning around the NHS.Responding further on Sunday in relation to Dowden’s letter, a BBC spokesperson said the broadcaster would like to highlight comments by the prime minister earlier this week in relation to PPE.Speaking at the No 10 briefing for the first time since recovering from the virus, Boris Johnson said: “I’m not going to minimise the logistical problems we’ve faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people in the right place, both in the NHS and care homes.”There was also support for the BBC from figures including the broadcaster James O’Brien, who said of Dowden’s letter: “I read this twice and can’t see a single reference to, never mind refutation of, the testimony given by the medics on the programme. It’s the starkest example yet that the Vote Leave government is trying to make confected tribal allegiance more important than evidence. Again.”Alan Rusbridger, the principal of Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford, and a former editor of the , tweeted: “It’s really not the job of the culture secretary to bollock the BBC for what your govt regards as bias, @OliverDowden Leave that to @Ofcom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f379ea316f2d795d0ed8b017aa2afd547e6058dd/399_88_3277_1966/master/3277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1c45c96920cb6dec4d256553e977e1","title":"drake dark lane demo tapes review","story":"OVOThere are flashes of skill and rawness in this odds-and-ends mixtape but it feels like a clumsy lunge at commercial successIn a world where the boundary between mixtapes and albums is becoming ever more blurred, the title of Drake’s latest album highlights its interstitial nature. That said, it’s still slightly misleading. There are tracks here that sound like demos – the mopey James Blake-isms of Chicago Freestyle are audibly unpolished – but for the most part, it ’s a way of collecting up leftovers and leaks, spare tracks he apparently has lying around the studio.Those inclined to view Drake’s career with a cool eye might be surprised he has any spare tracks lying around the studio, given the state of his last album. Listening to Scorpion, 25 songs long, required a certain degree of mental stamina: you needed, to steel yourself against the panicky sensation that you might die of old age before it ended. But it wasn’t the sheer quantity that was the problem so much as the quality of what was there. Scorpion had its moments but was so hopelessly uneven that it was easy to buy into the theory that its length was not due to its author’s teeming multiplicity of fantastic ideas, but an attempt to game the streaming services: more songs means more streams, more streams means a higher chart placing.Scorpion was both the second best-selling album of 2018 and the worst-reviewed album of Drake’s career, which leaves him in an intriguing position. Do you listen to the critics and pull your artistic socks up a bit? Or do you file them away in your ever-growing list of haters and continue raking in the cash by manipulating the means by which music is now distributed?The hit single from Dark Lane Demos suggests Drake thought the answer was a no-brainer. Toosie Slide wasn’t really a song, just a bald attempt to incite a dance craze on TikTok: a load of noncommittal meandering attached to instructions on how to do the titular move. On one level, you can’t blame artists for responding to market forces – TikTok exposure helped make hits out of Lizzo’s Truth Hurts and Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road – and Drake, to his immense credit, sang the whole thing with a tone of bored disdain, as if he found it all a little demeaning. He’s right: it is. Coming hot on the heels of Justin Bieber’s similarly meme-focussed Yummy, it feels like a harbinger of a nightmarish new pop era in which every major artist feels obliged to reduce themselves to the level of a children’s party DJ and trail their album with some ghastly millennial equivalent of the Birdie Dance or Agadoo.Thankfully, Toosie Slide isn’t the whole story. The stuff Drake has fished out of his waste bin is occasionally fantastic (the Southside-produced D4L booms along with guests Future and Young Thug doing most of the lyrical heavy lifting Demons is bracingly raw) and occasionally fascinating, not least the closing War, which not only features British drill producer AXL Beats but contains the erting sound of longtime UK rap supporter Drake going fully native: it’s all “mandem” this and “ends” that. It’s also occasionally hugely irritating, as on Pain 1993, which features Playboi Carti whose “baby voice” is a striking gimmick, but a little of it goes a very long way and there’s an awful lot of it here.Most of Dark Lane Demo Tapes, though, sits somewhere in between. Musically, it largely sticks with opaque washes of synths and muffled loops. Sometimes it sounds atmospheric – on From Florida With Love, producer MexikoDro constructs a spectral, impressively abstract backing track out of tape hiss and distortion – but a lot of the time it just sounds like a noncommittal shrug: tracks come and go without leaving much of a sonic impression. That leaves the listener concentrating on Drake’s lyrics, which is seldom one of life’s more encouraging experiences. You know what to expect, and you duly get it: anyone in the market for a game of Drake bingo should have their dobber out midway through opener Deep Pockets – on which we find him “losin’ sleep dealin’ with the envy” – and find themselves shouting “house” around the time of Desires, where yet again one of his relationships has gone up the wazoo because, you guessed it: “I was too good to you.”To complain about a rapper bragging about being rich feels a bit like complaining about a Highland dancer wearing a kilt. But there’s something about Drake’s continued willingness to juxtapose his crowing with peevish whinging that feels particularly offputting at this precise moment. Drake conjures a grim universe of self-justification and blame-apportioning, where blustering expressions of his eminence, wealth and superior understanding live alongside bursts of wounded anger that nobody displays sufficient gratitude or respect for his greatness, and a deathless conviction that half the world is ranged in a vast conspiracy to spread lies about him while he alone remains a source of truth and honesty. Listening to Dark Lane Demo Tapes occasionally feels like listening to one of Donald Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings put through AutoTune, a very odd way to spend your lockdown.Of course, Dark Lane Demo Tapes is a stopgap measure. It may be that his forthcoming album proper sees him moving away from the drizzly electronic haze and adopting a different lyrical stance. Then again, why should he? People are still lapping it up: on release, Dark Lane Demo Tapes’ contents immediately dominated global streaming charts. And Drake seems to inhabit a world where commercial success trumps everything. That it isn’t always an indicator of quality appears to be passing him by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db8f01dac76b7af2d76a4dab04c7d09ff85d781c/0_766_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399707ca631d1dff5fb2a9d7d14807c5","title":"rose mcgowan planet 9 review raging self soothing escapism","story":"(via Bandcamp)The actor-director’s debut album is serious in intent, if not fully realised“Look up, leave Earth,” whispers Rose McGowan at the start of her debut album “no battles left to fight”. Few people in the entertainment industry have lived as complex a life as this actor-turned-director, raised in a cult, once engaged to Marilyn Manson. She wrote a memoir about her ordeal at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, took up directing, and has now set her thoughts to music. This album soundtracks last year’s stage show of the same name.It’s little wonder, then, that Planet 9 is no typical record, but a collection of cinematic mood pieces that yearn for escape from our benighted planet. “Think who wins if you’re quiet,” she warns, once again, on the metaphorical Lonely House.McGowan knows she is no conventional singer on the plus side, her intonations suit the conceit here. David Bowie is an influence on the most musically resonant track Green Gold – originally released in 2015 as RM486. Elsewhere, trip-hop inflections (on Origami) and electronic pop (Sirene and the gleaming Now You’re Here) accompany McGowan as she rages, mourns and self-soothes on a work of escapism that doubles as an invitation to transcend. No vanity vehicle, then – but neither is it a fully-realised musical space odyssey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea769cbaaf7b558356c713c01478e762802fac14/0_0_7311_4879/master/7311.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aa46a92070927a496d27d83cb0e5c153 1400w","title":"no deal brexit could wreck uks chance of leading covid 19 global research","story":"Nobel scientists warn Britain will lose ‘superpower’ status if access barred to €100bn EU fundThe future of Britain’s world-renowned science sector – and its ability to lead global research into Covid-19 – risks being fatally undermined if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of this year.The warning has been issued by leading scientists – including UK-based Nobel prize winners – as fears grow that British science could lose access to the EU’s €100bn (£85bn) research funding scheme, Horizon Europe, which will run from 2021 to 2027.The government says it is “considering” applying to be an “associate member” (a relationship available for non-member states at the discretion of the 27 member nations) of Horizon Europe and the European Research Council (ERC), which is a component of the funding scheme.The ERC says one of its UK-based “grantees”, Prof Cecilia Mascolo, is already working in this country on rolling out a mobile app to quickly diagnose Covid-19.But with the EU-UK talks on a trade deal stalled, and Boris Johnson saying he will not seek an extension to the UK transition (which ends on 31 December) or pay extra budget contributions to prolong UK involvement, there are fears that a deal on British membership of the science funding schemes could be impossible to strike.Last week, the UK science minister, Amanda Sollaway, tweeted about how well home-based scientists had done from the European scheme.“Congratulations to all those who have been successful in the Horizon 2020 Proof of Concept awards,” she wrote. “UK applicants were awarded the largest number of grants – 13 awards! I wish all the winners success in exploring and developing their ideas further.”Since the start of the current EU scheme, Horizon 2020 (which will be succeeded by Horizon Europe), the UK has received more than £1.5bn in ERC income and £776m in MSCA (Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions) grants – more than any other EU country, and a fifth of the total.But Sir Andre Geim, a Nobel prize-winning scientist based at Manchester University, said it was “difficult to remain optimistic” about the future of UK science.“The coronavirus will surely make a huge dent in our economy with inevitable negative consequences for the science budget. If the virus does not suffocate the UK fundamental research, a no-deal Brexit will surely be the coup de grâce,” he said.Another distinguished scientist, Professor Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, said he was deeply frustrated. “Frankly, I think that it is a small disaster for UK research becoming deprived from this funding stream. I hardly see how we will catch up from a UK perspective and I think that already serious damage has been caused,” he said.“Under other circumstances we would have attracted many ERC grants to my new institute, but this strategy has been aborted by the uncertainty and the lack of guidance by consecutive UK governments over the last three years. We were extremely early in diagnosis of Covid-19 … and in testing and understanding the impact of Covid on our frail patients.“I feel very frustrated that we will not be able to tap the European funds to grow this institute even further. We could have become the biggest dementia initiative in Europe.”Sir Paul Nurse, another Nobel winner and head of the Francis Crick Institute – the UK’s leading medical and biological research centre – said: “My view is that it would be very good for British science to have associate membership with the EU Horizon scheme. However, I am not sure that this will be a priority for the government’s negotiations concerning EU exit.”Richard Catlow, the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society and a chemistry professor at University College London, said: “Continued association with Europe is the best option for UK science, and there is a consensus among the scientific community that it should continue. If the UK wants to continue benefiting it will have to keep contributing, as clearly it is not going to get something for nothing.”A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK is a science superpower, and we are increasing public investment in R\u0026ampD to £22bn by 2024-25 – the largest and fastest increase on record.“The UK is considering participation in EU programmes where they represent a real benefit to British people and industry and provide convincing value for money. This includes Horizon Europe, and negotiations are ongoing on the potential terms of UK participation.”UK involvement in several EU agencies and funding projects including Horizon is a key part of the EU-UK trade deal negotiations.The UK has until the end of June to ask for an extension to the transition period to smooth its exit from the EU. But Johnson has insisted he will not ask for an extension that would involve paying a post-Brexit contribution into the EU budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66d27bec204dbe9b314805a3376d0751c224005/0_170_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04320debf5f420d72452aa0646aec390","title":"exclusive fifth of uk homes children hungry lockdown","story":"New data shows families go without as parents lose income, meal voucher scheme is beset with problems and food banks can’t copeThe number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food.New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income.A government scheme to give pupils food vouchers worth £15 a week until schools reopen has been beset with problems, with many parents unable to download the vouchers or redeem them in supermarkets.Writing in the Observer on Sunday, Emma Thompson urged the government to prioritise children. Last year, Thompson joined young food ambassadors and the Children’s Right2Food campaign at Downing Street to call for an independent children’s food watchdog to help alleviate food poverty and monitor childhood nutrition. A year later, the government has yet to provide an official response.“It is difficult to accept, and for some even difficult to believe that there are still children going hungry in this rich and largely competent nation. But there are millions,” writes Thompson. “What is undeniable is that our government has yet to extend real lifelines to those who cannot afford food. We need emergency income support to put money in the pockets of families who are suffering.”Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, called on the government to implement an emergency income support scheme and for child benefits to be doubled and paid fortnightly.She said: “The government needs to move fast to protect vulnerable children and make them a priority. Having access to a nutritious diet is a basic human right. Struggling families need money in their pockets now and we need government to look urgently at income support and child benefits to provide solutions.”“It’s really tough. Dad works as a restorer and mum stays at home but there are nine of us under 18 in the house all the time now: three in primary school, two in high school, one in sixth form and three little ones. We have to be more resourceful about what we’re eating – simpler things like pasta and pizza and fish fingers that are easier and cheaper to cook.“There are no snacks or treats and the little ones are finding it harder, they’re not used to food being rationed. Trying to keep everyone balanced and happy is really hard at the moment. Fruit and veg isn’t the main thing Mum and Dad are worried about, they’re trying to just give us the main meals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/553a1b47370d622aa605069fd5f86ef7b44fa0fb/0_138_4125_2475/master/4125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2dcc5db2a79a92011a09d88a59481a6","title":"moments of magic 10 ways to help others in lockdown coronavirus from phone calls to milkshakes","story":"Feeling powerless during the coronavirus crisis? Lost? You can still potentially make a positive difference, whether joining a ‘scrub hub’ or contributing to food banksSo you have failed to read Proust. Or anything really. And you haven’t learned the piano. But you have had the “Covid cut” – and posted it on social media. Likewise sourdough. But you feel empty, ratty, unfulfilled, helpless. Mostly helpless.Sabrina Ellis in Wolverhampton is a check-in-and-chat responder on the scheme. “I feel like I’m helping people, without being an NHS frontline staff member,” she says. It is “almost like being in the shadows, supporting those other services”. Here are a few ways to lend a hand.When the scheme was launched on 25 March, the target of 250,000 volunteers was quickly passed. Then doubled, then tripled. “I was incredibly humbled by the response, but I wasn’t surprised this country loves the NHS,” says Kennelly.At 750,000, it stopped recruiting new volunteers, as there were many more than were needed for the tasks available (as of last Friday, 50,000 tasks had been completed). Keep an eye on it, though, as the situation develops. “New roles, or particular areas, might open,” says Kennelly.NHS Responders has also launched a self-referral number, which allows anyone shielding to ask for help. “We shouldn’t underestimate the depth of loneliness and isolation people are feeling,” says Kennelly. “People might feel it’s a bit luxurious to ask someone to call them. We’ve got thousands of people ready to do check-in-and-chat calls. It’s not luxurious these are unprecedented times.” The number to call is 0808 196 3646.If you are lucky – and you are in Wolverhampton – you might get Ellis. “I have got such a strong passion for supporting any inidual in need,” she says. I am pretty sure she is good at it. I feel better after speaking to her and I only rang to interview her.Tell people – your older neighbour, maybe – about self-referral. Help them do it. Think of the people who may not know about it, or be up to speed with tech. “Anybody who might need support,” says Ellis. “And it’s going to be all of us at some point.”… even if you are not part of the official army. You are doing it already, obviously, for parents and grandparents. You have given Grandad an unscheduled aural inspection. “IT’S FACETIME, GRANDAD, DON’T PUT THE PHONE TO YOUR EAR.” Also, maybe clean them …“Be a good neighbour, be a good friend, be a good relative,” says Kennelly. “Those phone calls are moments of magic in somebody’s day.”And think beyond your immediate family and friends, to the people who might not be getting daily check-ins. Great-Aunt Doris, maybe.Just before Britain went into lockdown, a group of friends in Lewisham, south London, started talking about what social isolation would mean in practice for vulnerable members of the community. They discussed “applying the principles of Mutual Aid to the situation”, says Kevin Smith, who has been involved from the beginning. “Horizontal principles of solidarity, not a charity model of one group of society helping another.”The group put leaflets through doors, asking who needed help and who could help, and started a Facebook page. Then people around the country got interested and involved. A website was launched.There are now more than 3,500 groups in the country. Smith says the number of people involved is in the millions. People helping others with the shopping, picking up a prescription, walking the dog, advising on renters’ rights, whatever. He tells me about how his group was contacted by the charity Age UK about a strawberry milkshake. A woman who was dying wanted one. Of course, they got her one, a very posh one, delivered. Oh gosh.“There’s this narrative foregrounded that’s it’s all about self-interest in times of crisis,” says Smith. “The flipside is that times of crisis also provoke these sentiments of collective care for each other, and that our wellbeing is fundamentally connected to the community as well.”The Trussell Trust supports a nationwide network of more than 1,200 food banks. There are also loads of independent ones. Trussell Trust’s director of policy and research, Gary Lemon, says that coronavirus has thrown up new challenges “from the health crisis and from the economic crisis and the increased demand for food banks that comes from that”.Many older volunteers have had to stay at home. “We went through a very fraught couple of weeks, with lots of volunteers dropping out of the system,” he says.He has been moved by the huge response, but there are still opportunities you can sign up on the website. Yes, there are risks, as there are for any key workers, but “we do everything we can to minimise them, with the bits of PPE where we can get it and physical distancing”. If you are not high risk, and you want to help, the Trussell Trust volunteering page is the best place to start.They have had to adapt, such as by moving to home delivery, which is a shame, as it means the food bank is not currently a place to come for a non-judgmental chat and a cup of tea. “But the first thing is the health and safety of the volunteers, and the people who need their services,” says Lemon.One plea from Lemon: “Obviously, we’re very grateful for any non-perishable food we get. But if you want to help, find out which sorts of food your local food bank needs, find out what they’re short of, fill those holes.”They try to make parcels as nutritionally balanced as possible. Lemon mentions cartons of juice, tins of meat and fish and – always – UHT milk. But it will vary from place to place, so find out first. They also take toiletries and hygiene products, such as toothpaste and sanitary towels. Many supermarkets have collection points where you can leave stuff. Online supermarkets have ways of donating when you check out.Annabel Maguire can. She is a set designer, but there is not much need for that at the moment. She wasn’t busy when, a few weeks ago, a doctor in her local Mutual Aid WhatsApp group who couldn’t get scrubs anywhere asked if anyone could make some.Maguire and three others in the group – a pattern cutter in the fashion industry, a charity worker, another with a textile shop – were quickly on to it. “I guess I had felt … not useless, but what could I even do with my time now can I help in any way?” she says. “And I did actually have some skills that could help, and we quickly realised that between us we did have the perfect skills to help.”They figured out how it could be done, a production line, but in different spaces without contact. And so Scrub Hub was born.At the time of speaking, there are 128 hubs across the UK with 1,766 volunteers who have delivered almost 3,500 scrubs. On the website, there is a directory of all the hubs. New ones are still being set up get involved. You need to know what you are doing, have experience of sewing garments, know what “overlocking” is. Maguire and her team were not happy when the Sun described them as a bunch of amateurs. They are proud of their scrubs.What can you do? Maguire and Ellis found meaning, purpose and structure by utilising their skills. “It sounds cliched, but I asked how I could help people,” says Ellis. “I look for where the gap is that people are trying to fill.”What gaps might you be able to fill? What are your skills? There are organisations such as Volunteering Matters and Do It that can connect you with charities. Reach Volunteering matches people with specialist professional skills. On my local Nextdoor page, in Brent (which has a high mortality rate), an overwhelmed carpenter is looking for help making coffins. That might be too grim.Maybe you have no useful skills. Or you still have an actual job, no time, but possibly a bit of spare change? Don’t forget charities. They are suffering badly, because of event cancellations and shop closures. They may not want your “vintage” clothes at the moment, or your CDs, but they desperately need funds.Obviously, there are far too many charities to list. You may know who you want to donate to, but don’t forget about the new homeless, people who have lost jobs, the hospitality industry, the arts. One way to ensure it is going to the frontline is by donating to National Emergencies Trust, which is coordinating the UK coronavirus appeal.Do something, though. Forget Proust you are never going to read him. The sourdough is a disaster no one likes it. Get up, look out, help others. Help yourself.

Here are some of your selections:The latest hit documentary series off the Netflix conveyor belt is The Last Dance, a deep e into Michael Jordan’s glittering Chicago Bulls career. Its success has raised the profile of this 1994 cult classic, set in Chicago but a world away from the glamour of the NBA. Following two teenagers from deprived inner-city areas trying to make it in the big leagues, Hoop Dreams paints a gritty picture of a ided America. Originally planning to make a short film, director Steve James ended up with 250 hours of footage filmed over five years, condensed into one film that many of you nominated as one of the best ever made.This Netflix documentary recently launched its second series, following the stricken club into League One after the first instalment covered their disastrous Championship campaign. As you might expect, it is rich in tragicomedy, with former club director Charlie Methven repeatedly channeling David Brent. There’s an authenticity here that readers warmed to, something lacking in glossier behind-the-scenes productions. As YorkieBrummy wrote, it is “representative of what running and supporting a football club is actually like in the real world”.Stacy Peralta’s 2001 film takes a wild ride through LA’s nascent skateboarding culture in the 70s, helped by acres of archive footage and a killer soundtrack. Charting the growth of the Zephyr team from empty backyard swimming pools to the big time, it is loved by skaters – “It blew my mind. I went to see it three times,” said froose. But Lollipop called it “an outstanding film, even for someone with zero interest in skateboarding”. Also recommended by Howlinpete is Peralta’s “uplifting” 2004 surfing documentary Riding Giants, “with stunning cinematography and candid interviews with surfers who try to explain why they risk their lives.”In 2001, American Samoa lost 31-0 to Australia in a World Cup qualifier. This popular pick from 2014 finds the team still tormented by that humiliating defeat. Enter Thomas Rongen, an eccentric, magnetic coach who brings the team together through force of will. For a film about losing, this is heartwarming, life-affirming stuff, not least the story of defender Jaiyah Saelua, the first transgender player in a World Cup qualifier. A feature film is in the works, starring Michael Fassbender as Rongen. If you liked this, The Other Final – about Bhutan v Montserrat in 2002 – is also worth a look.This Netflix series covers four seasons (so far) with the Independence Pirates of Kansas and the East Mississippi Lions, two lowly college football programs that offer a final opportunity to players whose hopes of reaching the NFL have been derailed by off-field problems. “Some of the players’ backgrounds are pretty eye-opening” says Icke9498. “Even at a young age, those players put their bodies on the line and unfortunately very few make it to the NFL.”Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno’s 2006 film does not cover any of Zinedine Zidane’s many career highlights. Instead, it tracks one of the most gifted footballers of all time across one live match, using 17 different camera angles and pitchside microphones that pick up the great man’s grunts and mutterings. “If this was intended to intensify the impact of Zidane’s impassivity, it works,” wrote Richard Williams back in 2006. Soundtracked by Mogwai, this unconventional work offers a singular focus that would normally only be available to those inside the stadium.Another popular pick among readers, this 2010 documentary explores the West Indies’ rise from downtrodden underdogs to the best cricket team on earth. The team became a symbol of resistance against racism – as reggae legend Bunny Wailer puts it, “slaves whipping the arses of masters”. Stevan Riley’s film moves with the speed and swagger that made the Windies so loved and feared, showcasing the brutal brilliance of Malcolm Marshall, Viv Richards and many more. Essential viewing.Marta Prus’s documentary about Russian rhythmic gymnast Margarita Mamun preparing for the 2016 Olympics was suggested by alexito. “They had one showing where I live, and hundreds of chattering smartphone-wielding teenage gymnasts turned up. This astonishing film absolutely captivated them, bringing gasps of shock at the cruelty of a perfect villain.” Mamun’s caustic coach steals the show, but the mental and physical toll placed on her protege makes for compelling viewing.First-time director Richard de Aragues goes behind the scenes at the Isle of Man TT, a deceptively dangerous motorcycle race around quaint, winding country lanes. Nominated by FrustratedCentre Half, this is “a documentary about ordinary people, their passion for sport and it’s inexplicable hold over them – and the sound quality is truly astonishing”. Also recommended is Road, a film about the tragic, talented Dunlop racing clan. “An extraordinary hour of film making,” wrote BlackPhelan.World Cup USA ‘94. Against the hosts, Colombian defender Andrés Escobar swings a fateful boot at a cross, and deflects the ball into his own net. Five days after Colombia return home, Escobar is shot and killed. This grim tale is familiar to most football fans, but the murky subtext is not. Escobar was a star at Atlético Nacional, a team dogged by links to notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. This jaw-dropping film explores the insidious influence of cartels in Colombian football, and the violence and chaos that followed.This Netflix film was suggested by Splutterer “as it explains why fights break out in ice hockey … I always thought it was purely for entertainment”. The truth is much more complex, revealed in sit-down interviews with several old-school NHL enforcers, many of whom were unexpectedly thrown into an unforgiving role that is now dying out. “Interesting, thoughtful and moving” was our reader verdict.One of sport’s most famous images was captured off the track. During the 1968 200m Olympic medal ceremony, black US athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a gloved fist in protest. But what about the other athlete on the podium? Australia’s Peter Norman had been forgotten, but this film by his nephew, Matt, brought his story to life. A supreme sprinter, Norman was ostracised for backing Smith and Carlos’s protest – it was even his idea for them to wear one glove each. Reader Richard Johns says “it’s brilliant: the best sports film I’ve ever seen”.Starting with football nostalgia, from I Believe in Miracles, which covers Nottingham Forest’s extraordinary success under Brian Clough, to Howard’s Way, a look back at Everton’s glory years in the 80s with Howard Kendall. More legendary managers can be found in Bobby Robson: More than a Manager and Shankly: Nature’s Fire – “a great insight into what made him such a formidable manager,” says WimpyLad.The BBC recently replayed All By Himself, their documentary about the legendary George Best, and it’s still available on iPlayer. Football fans from Northern Ireland might also enjoy Heroes: “Northern Ireland v England in 2005, David (Healy) v Goliath. A must watch,” says gafferchapel. For something completely different, Four Year Plan, focuses on the big-spending era at QPR: “a fascinating look into the minds of crazy, delusional billionaires,” writes rafab.Cycling is a sport with a rich back catalogue, not least A Sunday in Hell, Jørgen Leth’s film about the brutal Paris–Roubaix race. Accidental Death of a Cyclist covers the sad, drug-fuelled demise of Marco Pantani, while The Flying Scotsman focuses on track cyclist Graeme Obree and his groundbreaking home-made contraptions.If it’s extreme challenges you’re after, then Netflix’s documentary The Race That Eats Its Young, chronicling the unforgiving Barkley marathons in Tennessee, might be for you. Free Solo, the story of a climber’s death-defying quest to conquer a sheer rock face, guarantees sweaty palms. As for extreme athletes, TheNatural81 nominates HBO’s Andre the Giant – “a sad tale of what it’s like to be so huge”.Veering into true crime territory, Inside the Mind of Aaron Hernandez is a three-part documentary on the former NFL star who ended up in prison for murder. Another film about on off-field issues is Once Brothers, about Yugoslavian basketball stars Drazen Petrovic and Vlade Divac in a time of civil war. “One Serbian, one Croatian, both superstars. Fascinating and highly recommended,” says youdmakeagreatcop.Finally, we have suggestions from the world of cricket (Death of a Gentleman), minor-league ball clubs (Battered Bastards of Baseball), boxing (Tyson, and the peerless Muhammad Ali film When We Were Kings), rugby union (the day Llanelli beat the All Blacks). If you still can’t pick one sport, there’s always Losers – a Netflix series on everything from lower-league football to ice-skating mavericks. Happy watching!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e58700022689fa7dee64ea27f50e85b347f87dc/895_0_1108_664/master/1108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39911b7b6dc68564c8d0e1c8ae9bfe67","title":"imaginary american town tourist attraction agloe new york state","story":"Map-makers insert fake towns or trap-streets to catch out plagiarists, but Agloe, in New York state, took on a strange life of its ownIn 2008, Argleton village in west Lancashire appeared on Google, complete with weather reports, a job site and an estate agent advertising houses for sale. Argleton vanished two years later. While its site was – and still is – a damp field in the middle of nowhere, it’s worth noting that Argleton is an anagram of G Not Real. Although Google never admitted to having created it, Argleton was a phantom settlement, planted as a trap.In the world of digital mapping and cartography, snares to catch unwary plagiarists take the form of fake roads or places, known as “trap streets” or “paper towns”. For some, such as Lye Close or Noereal Road, the clue is in the name. (A real alleyway in Cardiff that served as a trap street in the 2014 Dr Who episode Face the Raven may, conversely, be the world’s only fictional fictional street.)Perhaps the most notable cartographic curiosity is Agloe, immortalised in John Green’s 2008 novel, Paper Towns. When its protagonist Margo disappears, she leaves oblique clues as to her whereabouts. The trail leads to somewhere and nowhere – Agloe.Agloe was the creation of two men: Otto Lindberg and Ernest Alpens from America’s General Drafting Company. Commissioned to make a map of New York state in the 1930s, they used the initials of their names to create a paper town – Agloe – which they dropped into a dirt road intersection in the Catskills.When it appeared years later on a map made by one of their competitors, Rand McNally, General Drafting threatened to sue. McNally pointed out that it would lose the case: Agloe’s general store could be found at the intersection. Its store manager, having spotted Agloe on a map, had taken it as a good place to set up shop. A lack of houses or indeed a town of any kind should have suggested otherwise the unfortunate shopkeeper went out of business shortly after. It was, however, sufficient proof that Agloe existed. Contemporary maps still feature Agloe. This, its strange history and the popularity of the book Paper Towns ensures a steady stream of curious sightseers.“Isn’t it ironic? Like rain on your wedding day,” sang Alanis Morissette in Ironic. That the song failed to include any actual examples of irony is in itself ironic. As is the continuing existence of Agloe, a place that still is, because it never was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8cb291e1bc410a577b7c274e17dd874d1b46698/0_1102_2091_1253/master/2091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd0d1fc840fddf12b9a55fa04dde3b3","title":"richard francis burton explorer mecca horn africa nile victorian","story":"This fearless Victorian flirted with several ways of dying while looking for the source of the Nile, entering Mecca illegally and exploring other cultures’ attitudes toward sexPassport detailsSir Richard Francis Burton, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer and diplomat.Claim to fameIt says something about the shallowness of celebrity that a polylingual, dashing, brave, randy scholar who travelled through East Africa to try to find the source of Nile, translated The Arabian Nights into English and had the chutzpah to visit Mecca is overshadowed by a Welsh actor of the same name (with an admittedly nice speaking voice) who married Elizabeth Taylor a lot.Supporting documentationBurton, who was born in Torquay in 1821, lived a life of barely credible derring-do, which he recorded in dozens of books and articles. He was particularly interested in the contrast between Victorian prudery and the attitudes of other cultures towards sex and sexual morality. He translated various books of erotica into English. This and his general irascibility made him a controversial figure and hampered his subsequent career as a diplomat. However, a series of army postings gave him the chance for more travel and the time to work on his literary endeavours: the most famous of which is his multi-volume translation of One Thousand And One Nights. His most noteworthy expeditions were the ill-fated trips to the Horn of Africa (his team was set upon by Somali nomads and Burton’s face was impaled by a javelin) the failed attempt to discover the source of the Nile — Burton ended up too sick to continue and the insanely risky visit to Mecca, which he undertook in disguise: “a hasty action, a misjudged word … And my bones would have whitened the desert sand”. He also visited Iceland and lived for spells in Brazil, Damascus and Trieste.Distinguishing markWith his lush facial hair and stern physiognomy, Burton was the physical archetype of the Victorian explorer. Yet, he seems to have been sceptical about the British imperial project. His undoubted superpower was an ability to learn languages. He claimed to have developed a system that enabled him to master most languages in a couple of weeks and could speak dozens, including German, Urdu, Marathi, Greek and Arabic. However, he admitted defeat in his attempts to learn Russian.Last sightedIn death, Burton even managed to bring a whiff of orientalism to the buttoned-up London cemetery in Mortlake. The mausoleum he shares with his wife Isabel is a marble tent with a ladder in the back that leads up to a small window. Through it, you can see the great explorer’s dusty coffin surrounded by knick-knacks brought back from his trips overseas.Intrepidness ratingThe trip along the Nile almost killed him and the trip to Mecca would have led to his execution if his true identity had been discovered.

A new podcast explores the part the agency playedTwo memories: one, from November 1989, of a crowded bar at 3am in Berlin, not far from the wall breached just 36 hours beforehand. My brother and I are in town for the craic and biggest street party of all time. An awful band called Eurocheque strikes up a cover of the Scorpions’ Big City Nights and, inebriated, the crowd joins in. An elderly couple from the eastern sector two-steps to the beat. It’s very moving. A few months earlier, the Scorpions had played a music festival in Moscow, and were already working on their most famous song: Wind of Change.Second memory: the less epic surroundings of Mote Park, Kent, three decades later. The Scorpions, this time for real, with bedazzling lightshow and backdrop of peace signs on a holograph of the Berlin Wall Klaus Meine – born 1948, year of the Berlin blockade – singing Wind of Change through a chilly night. “The world is closing in Did you ever thinkThat we could be so close, like brothers … ?”Now, it turns out, that sparkler-swaying anthem may have been contrived by US intelligence as cultural subversion of communism. An upcoming podcast series, Wind of Change, by the New Yorker’s Pat Radden Keefe, investigates whether it was – as the journalist was told a decade ago – actually a CIA-crafted confection.The producers can be sure of an audience for Keefe’s exploration of “the dark byways of cold war history and … nearly a hundred interviews in four countries with rockers and spies”. But if the song was created by the agency, this was nothing new – indeed, it would have been a late arrival to a policy and practice almost as long-established as the Berlin Wall itself.As the United States and Soviet Union amassed sufficient nuclear arsenals to blow the world up several times over, and – respectively – installed murderous dictatorships across Latin America and colonised Eastern Europe, each also stirred riptides of cultural subversion, one of the other. It wasn’t until 1990 that a book by Joseph Nye gave all this a name: Soft Power, exerted “when one country gets other countries to do want what it wants”.From 1947, Voice of America radio erted its attentions from wartime to cold war, broadcasting to the USSR and Warsaw Pact countries. But the CIA had also built a facade of front structures in pursuit of American cultural hegemony, beginning with the Propaganda Assets Inventory, which claimed indirect influence over 800 publications, and in 1950 the International Organisations Division under a former secretary general of New York’s Museum of Modern Art, Thomas Braden.Appalled at the appeal of communism in Europe, these agencies waged cultural cold war against serial Soviet “peace initiatives”. A CIA-run Congress for Cultural Freedom was coordinated by Russian composer and writer Nicolas Nabokov, exiled in the US, with offices in 35 countries, funded and tasked to mount exhibitions, stage concerts and sponsor anti-communist activity, in intellectual disguise.Among its apparently benign charges was the vibrant, impeccably liberal, Encounter magazine, based in London and edited by Stephen Spender.Music, even before the Scorpions, was always central. Modernist orchestral music was anathema to the Soviets, and the imposition of classical forms a pillar of domestic cultural orthodoxy. At the centre of the tussle was the 20th century’s greatest composer, Dmitri Shostakovich, who worked on a knife-edge dais between innovation and censorship for what the communist cultural commissar Andrei Zhdanov called “formalism” from the decadent west. The CIA was among many trying to secure his defection when Josef Stalin released Shostakovich to address the Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace in New York in 1949.But Shostakovich frustrated and confounded his western supporters. He returned to Russia and enabled the USSR to present him as a loyal comrade, a claim as outrageous as attempts in the west, from the mid-1970s until the present, to ventriloquise Shostakovich as a political dissident.Soviet contempt for western modernism was an invitation to US intelligence to promote such music. Accordingly, in 1952, the CCF coordinated the Festival of Twentieth-Century Masterpieces of Modern Arts, in Paris. The Boston Symphony Orchestra was flown at State Department expense to perform Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring Braden remarked that the performance “brought more acclaim for the US than Dwight Eisenhower could in a hundred speeches”.Russia was equally canny: the Leningrad Philharmonic toured the BBC Proms and other venues in 1971 (I was among those who gratefully benefited) and even kept its “touring conductor”, Arvid Jansons, on hand as principal guest conductor at the Hallé orchestra in Manchester.The visual arts scene was also fertile terrain. Nowadays, it is hard to imagine a world ided between socialist realism in the Soviet Union and abstract expressionism as a tool of the CIA in defence of the west. But that is how the agency saw innovations pioneered by Jackson Pollock and others.Joseph McCarthy’s acolytes in purging the American left found abstract expressionism “unAmerican”. But the CIA begged to differ, finding in the new art an assertive inidualism – in stark contrast to the collectivist confinements of socialist realism.The centre of gravity in fine art shifted from Paris to New York. In her book on the cultural cold war, Who Paid the Piper?, Frances Stonor Saunders says the CIA deported itself “in the manner of a Renaissance prince, except that it acted secretly”.The artists – Pollock especially, but also Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning – benefited from CIA-backed international promotion, despite their political views.The same irony applied to jazz, still largely black music in the US, where artists’ tours, like everything else, were segregated. But the racial origins of jazz had been used in propaganda against Nazi Germany, so why not red Russia?The genius of Louis Armstrong was pounced upon, and the trumpeter appointed a “goodwill jazz ambassador”, dispatched on government-funded tours of Europe and Africa, while Jim Crow laws applied at home.Jazz “ambassadors”, however, proved less manageable than the painters. Armstrong withdrew from the post – reneging on what was intended to be a showcase tour of the USSR – after President Eisenhower refused deployment of troops to enforce desegregation laws of 1957. “Satchmo” resumed tours when the policy was reversed and a ision mobilised in Arkansas.Dizzy Gillespie joined the first State Department-organised tour in 1956, but wouldn’t attend official briefings, saying he “wasn’t going to apologise for the racist policies of America”. The white jazz pianist Dave Brubeck was another “ambassador” for US cultural policy, dispatched much later, on a 13-concert tour of the USSR in 1985.The CIA’s most infamous meddling with literature concerned Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon and George Orwell’s Animal Farm and 1984. Copies of the former – deemed anti-communist commentary - were carried across the Iron Curtain by air balloon, while the French Communist Party ordered its members to mass-purchase, then destroy, copies.Everyone knows that Orwell held dictatorships of all political colours in equal contempt, and that the closing scene in Animal Farm featuring humans and pigs can refer to both systems.But Stonor Saunders’ book uncovered a scheme by the CIA to secure film rights to Animal Farm in order to doctor its ending, and show a revolt against the pigs, with the other tyrants – humans – omitted.The CIA also changed the ending of the movie version of 1984, in defiance of Orwell’s instructions. In the novel, the protagonist Winston Smith is cowered by the generic totalitarian regime its last line is: “He loved Big Brother.” But in the film Winston and his lover, Julia, are shot down after the former declaims: “Down with Big Brother!”Significantly, though, whatever impact the CIA’s efforts may or may not have had, they were overtaken by the avant-garde’s own potency. By the late 1960s, cultural foment was off the leash worldwide, and the new music – integrated into protest and peace movements antagonistic towards both capitalism and communism – cut both ways in terms of the cold war. And where rock ’n’ roll culture was eroding the latter, it needed little help from US intelligence.Although the Prague Spring of 1968 was crushed, a band called Plastic People of the Universe chipped away at the edifice of Czech communism, only because, as keyboard player Joseph Janiček told me: “In Prague in 1968, if you wanted to play your own music you became political whether you intended it or not, because the authorities deemed that you were a threat to their ‘official’ culture.” The eventual “Velvet” revolution was so-called not because of any CIA shenanigans, but in part the influence of the Velvet Underground on the Plastics and their champion, Václav Havel.By the time Bruce Springsteen played Chimes of Freedom in East Berlin in 1988 – one of the most politically charged performances ever – no one was in any doubt what was happening: the CIA was irrelevant.But then, after that festival in Moscow in August 1989, the Scorpions released Wind of Change, with its references to the Moskva river and Gorky Park. This lyrical celebration of the proclaimed new world order sits oddly in the band’s other material from that time, markedly Crazy World, with its disillusionment: “Spend your dollars and roubles  Buy a piece of the wall … I’m so sick of it all”.So we’ll see what Keefe’s podcast turns up. Meanwhile, the British writer Robert Winder is about to publish a book about soft power in a post-Scorpions world, and he wonders: “It is hard in these Trump-damaged times even to recall the cultural moment when a pianist, Dave Brubeck, could be told, on a 1958 tour of Poland: ‘What you brought wasn’t just jazz. It was the Grand Canyon. It was America’.”The first of eight episodes of Pat Radden Keefe’s podcast,  Wind of Change, will be broadcast on Spotify on 11 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Against a backdrop of big skies, lonely farmhouses and sandy beaches, physical distancing comes easily here.In small communities, such as those on Uist, isolation and the vast open spaces have preserved the local population from the devastation wrought elsewhere by the Covid-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else, lockdown has been strictly enforced and observed. Travel has been highly restricted – only lorry drivers and essential workers have been allowed on to the ferries since 16 March. And, as of last week, this archipelago of six principal islands linked by causeways has had no confirmed cases so far.It is this very particular geographic and social profile that has led ministers to see islands such as Uist as the perfect location in which to test strategies to end the lockdown. The notion has been floated by several scientists and endorsed by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said last week there was “scientific justification” for piloting measures such as contact tracing to “relax measures at a progressively greater rate” on some island communities before the rest of the UK.So are islanders rushing to volunteer to throw off the shackles of lockdown? Not a bit. In fact some want it to go on even longer.“People either want a lockdown as long as everyone else, or an extended lockdown,” Uisdean Robertson said. The councillor for North Uist, a ward in Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the Western Isles local authority, said his constituents were evenly split and no one had contacted him to press for an early end to the lockdown.“When you have the Michael Goves of the world, people that are remote from here, coming out with that kind of stuff,” Robertson said, “there was some irritation. Guinea pigs was one of the terms used.”The reason for the irritation is that the situation in Uist is not as clear cut as it seems from the outside. There are a substantial number of retirees and two care homes on the islands. Some islanders feel at greater risk from Covid-19 than those on the mainland.There is also no doubt that surviving lockdown on the islands is easier than in cities such as Glasgow or London. Robertson can walk his dog for miles every day over the “machair” – the rich grasslands – and among the crofts without seeing another human being.On Benbecula, Rev Drew Kuzma has a large garden in his Church of Scotland manse and empty sandy beaches to wander with his family.“We’re fairly fortunate. My nearest neighbour is 300 yards away – if it’s windy, we can’t even hear one another,” Kuzma said. But he says he and others are cautious.“Everybody would love to see the economy return to normal. But if you had to weigh the economy against health – and given that I’d be the one to oversee the final moments of someone’s existence – I just don’t think you can compare that.”Stephen Peteranna, also on Benbecula, has more to lose from the lockdown. He runs three hotels, two of which are shut – the other remains open for essential workers, such as a refrigerator engineer who came to fix some supermarket freezers.He would support an early lifting of restrictions – he is sceptical of the claim that there have been no cases so far – but with some caveats. He said: “If there’s a national advantage to using the islands as test beds, maybe we just have to get on with that. But ending lockdown early wouldn’t mean tourists could come – and the government might end business support. I’d be really worried that staff would lose their jobs if we weren’t allowed to keep them on furlough.”There are signs of some normality returning. Hector Stewart furloughed most of his 21 staff at Kallin Shellfish five weeks ago, but last week they began fishing for lobster, crab and scallops again.“We have taken about half of our staff back on and we’re finding small markets – back to doing once- or twice-weekly trips to Glasgow,” he said. “Everybody would welcome the lockdown to be eased, but we’ve got to be careful that we don’t get the virus.”He is worried about the elderly and the relative scarcity of medical facilities, adding: “But if it can be done safely, yes, we’d support it.”Even so, there are still many questions. Who would decide if the lockdown is lifted?

The fund has gone largely unspent since its launch.“We struggle to afford food. My mum is diabetic and needs medicine. We can’t buy it,” says Dominique Pierre, a now-jobless Chagossian living in Port Louis, the Mauritian capital. “We are cutting her pills in half to make them last, but she really needs to take one per day.”Worried about how long they can sustain themselves, members of the community contacted the British High Commission in Mauritius to request help.“Unfortunately, we regret to inform that there is no mechanism currently in place to implement a plan for the Chagossian community,” the Foreign Office responded in an email, seen by the Observer.The plight of the Chagossians began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the 2,000-strong population of the Chagos Islands was forcibly removed by Britain to allow the US military to establish a strategic air base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.Islanders were exiled in Mauritius and the Republic of Seychelles, where many claim to have suffered discrimination and been excluded from employment and education opportunities. In 2002, native Chagossians and their children were given the right to British passports. Since then, more than 3,000 have emigrated to the UK, the majority settling in Crawley, West Sussex.The £40m fund, which was to be spent over 10 years, was launched in November 2016, when the British government announced it had extended the lease for the US to continue hosting its military base on Diego Garcia. While the base is in operation the UK government has forbidden the exiled islanders from resettling, despite their long campaign for their right to return.The fund, branded hush money by critics, was created as part of a “Chagossian Development Plan” created by the Foreign Office and US State Department during a meeting in June 2016, in the run-up to the lease extension, a document obtained by a Freedom of Information request shows.About £580,000 of the fund has been spent so far. This money has been used to pay for some English lessons and also short visits by small groups of Chagossians to their homeland. When members of the community asked the Foreign Office to deploy the package directly to improve their situation, including assisting with access to housing and immigration fees, their requests were declined.“We recognise this is a worrying time for many Chagossians,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “We have already established a fund worth approximately £40m to support long-term employment, health and education programmes for Chagossians, and are looking at ways to support the Mauritian government as they deal with the economic impact of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/985a5de1395e6dc4daa8ef65e5c1942d6ee31d5e/0_196_1822_1094/master/1822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=286ae13964008ceafd8cf338299f026f","title":"british public turn to prayer as one in four tune in to religious services","story":"Young people lead resurgence of faith, and Vicar of Dibley tops a poll as the best screen priest to lead nation through the crisis A quarter of adults in the UK have watched or listened to a religious service since the coronavirus lockdown began, and one in 20 have started praying during the crisis, according to a new survey.The findings of the poll reinforce indications of an increase in the numbers of people turning to faith for succour amid uncertainty and despair.The Church of England has said that unexpectedly high numbers of people are tuning into online or broadcast services, and 6,000 people phoned a prayer hotline in its first 48 hours of operation. Other faiths have also reported surges in people engaging with online religious activities as places of worship have been closed during the lockdown.The survey of more than 2,000 people, commissioned by the Christian aid agency Tearfund and carried out last weekend, found that a third of young adults aged between 18 and 34 had watched or listened to an online or broadcast religious service, compared with one in five adults over the age of 55.One in five of those who have tuned into services in the past few weeks say they have never gone to church.A separate poll, commissioned by Christian Aid, found that The Vicar of Dibley, the Rev Geraldine Granger, the BBC TV character played by Dawn French, would be the public’s choice of screen priest to lead the UK through the coronavirus crisis.

Many had been charged with “spreading false news” or “misusing social media” under a broad 2015 counterterrorism law, which has expanded the definition of terror to include all kinds of dissent.An Egyptian press officer did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment, but authorities have previously denied rights violations and justified arrests on national security grounds.Following general-turned-president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s rise to power in 2013, most of Egypt’s television programs and newspapers have taken the government position and steered clear of criticism, or else disappeared.Many privately owned Egyptian news outlets have been quietly acquired by companies affiliated with the country’s intelligence service.But even a pro-government voice hasn’t spared 12 journalists working for state-owned media outlets, who have landed in jail for expressing various private views on social media, the report said.One of them is Atef Hasballah, editor-in-chief of the AlkararPress website. When he challenged the health ministry’s coronavirus case count on his Facebook page last month, he was promptly bundled into a police van and detained on suspicion of “joining a terrorist organisation”.Egypt’s public prosecutor warned in a recent statement that those who spread “false news” about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines. At least 12 iniduals have been caught up in the Covid-19-motivated crackdown so far, according to Amnesty.Last month, authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons. Separately, Egypt expelled a  correspondent over an article that indicated the coronavirus infection rate may be higher than officially reported.The journalists interviewed by Amnesty reported increasingly direct state intervention in their coverage. Many working for government-owned or aligned papers said they receive specific instructions via WhatsApp on what to report and to omit.For instance, a directive on how to handle Donald Trump’s proposal to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year asked reporters not to mention the plan’s violations of long-standing Arab policies, as Trump and el-Sisi have cultivated close ties.Those who do not follow the official line, such as by praising prison conditions and smearing the state’s political opponents, “lost their jobs, were interrogated or imprisoned,” one journalist was quoted as saying. “I cannot even imagine that someone could refuse to comply.”Marking World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty urged Egyptian authorities to halt their censorship, harassment and intimidation of journalists, and to release those detained “solely for carrying out their work”.In March Egyptian authorities forced a  journalist to leave the country after she reported on a scientific study that said Egypt was likely to have many more coronavirus cases than have been officially confirmed.Ruth Michaelson, who had lived in and reported from Egypt since 2014, was advised last week by western diplomats that the country’s security services wanted her to leave immediately after her press accreditation was revoked and she was asked to attend a meeting with authorities about her visa status."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73296b7952dcc80fc2528288a629e6265f949ef1/695_368_1254_752/master/1254.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3e8fb85a7af602a80409ba32c910a3","title":"eve of genocide brazil urged save amazon tribes covid 19 sebastiao salgado","story":"Open letter by photojournalist Sebastião Salgado and global figures warns disease could decimate indigenous peoplesby  Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Brazil’s leaders must take immediate action to save the country’s indigenous peoples from a Covid-19 “genocide”, a global coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has said.In an open letter to the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, figures including Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney warned the pandemic meant indigenous communities in the Amazon faced “an extreme threat to their very survival”.“We are on the eve of a genocide,” Salgado, who has spent nearly four decades documenting the Amazon and its inhabitants, told the .Even before Covid-19, Brazil’s indigenous peoples were locked in what activists call a historic struggle for survival.Critics accuse Bolsonaro, a far-right populist in power since January 2019, of stimulating the invasion of indigenous reserves and dismantling the government agencies supposed to protect them.“Indigenous communities have never been so under attack … The government has no respect at all for the indigenous territories,” Salgado said, pointing to crippling budget cuts and the recent sacking of several of top environmental officials who had targeted illegal prospectors and loggers.But the letter said the pandemic had made an already bleak outlook under Bolsonaro even worse by paralysing what protection efforts remained.“As a result, there is nothing to protect indigenous peoples from the risk of genocide caused by an infection introduced by outsiders who enter their land illegally,” argued the signatories, who also include the supermodels Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Campbell, the author Mario Vargas Llosa, the artist Ai Weiwei, the architect Norman Foster and the actor Meryl Streep.Salgado, who documented Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, warned that the 300,000 indigenous people in the Brazilian Amazon faced annihilation.“In Rwanda we saw a violent genocide, an attack, where people were physically killed. What will happen in Brazil will also mean the death of the indigenous,” said the 76-year-old who has spent the last seven years photographing the region for his final major project.“It would mean the extinction of Brazil’s indigenous peoples,” Salgado added.Fears Covid-19 could devastate indigenous communities grew last month when the death of a Yanomami teenager revived horrific memories of epidemics caused by roadbuilders and gold prospectors in the 1970s and 80s.The Brazilian city so far worst hit by coronavirus is Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, where part of the Yanomami reserve is located.Salgado – who is calling for the creation of an army-led taskforce to evict intruders from protected areas – admitted Bolsonaro would not act of his own volition. But he believed international pressure could force the government to do so, as happened last year when global outrage resulted in the military being deployed to extinguish fires in the Amazon.“Just in the Brazilian Amazon we have 103 indigenous groups which have never been contacted – they represent humanity’s pre-history,” Salgado said. “We cannot allow all of this to disappear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cb2e9e1b40f79e59c473409ff36c078f707c74/0_165_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203322f879bd6ad7f8dcf778db92d8f4","title":"exhausted relieved yearning for change britain on ve day","story":"As the UK celebrated wartime victory against Germany in May 1945, a landslide Labour poll win was only weeks awayIt is through the photographs that we’ll imagine VE Day this week. Cheerful London crowds, thronging Piccadilly, packed down Whitehall, or pressing together down the Mall. Young men and women, their uniforms unbuttoned and their eyes blurred, dancing in the streets, crammed on to vans and buses, or splashing in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. Flag-bedecked street parties, the youngest concentrating on their celebration tea while the big kids and grown-ups, buttoned into their best clothes, turn to the meet the camera’s gaze.But the apertured images simplify and limit the moment. Better, if you want to start to grasp the variety of what Victory in Europe meant, to explore the Manchester artist LS Lowry’s painting VE Day 1945. The cityscape is festooned with flags, crowds pack the squares and closes, and people pour out of the pub. Yet, away from the centre, the roads between the terraces and factories are emptier and quieter. Not everyone is dancing in a circle. A policeman watches. Someone walks the dog. A little girl, her head set firm, exits to the left on her own. In the middle of the painting, four tiny figures have scaled a roof and look out over the celebrations – trying, like us, to get a sense of the spectacle.Inter-allied politics and the German desperation to get as many troops as possible westwards, out of the hands of the Red Army, had meant a stuttering end to the European war. Hostilities in north-west Europe ceased on 5 May. When the Germans announced their surrender two days later, VE Day was celebrated on 8 May in the UK and US, even though peace only officially arrived, after the signing of a formal surrender that included the Soviet Union, on the morning of the following day.Close to the frontline, some servicemen celebrated wildly as soon as they heard the fighting would stop. Others were still at work, keeping the vast military machine going, guarding prisoners or looking out for Germans who hadn’t heard it was over. Back at home, exuberant revelry was matched with a more restrained desire to watch a historic moment. Exhausted by years of wartime working hours, many Britons were grateful for the rest. Yet the two-day holiday was hardly relaxing for those working in pubs and cinemas, let alone housewives queuing up early outside the shops if they wanted to find something for a victory tea.There was relief – that Hitler had been defeated, and that the country was no longer under threat of aerial attack (the last V2 rocket had hit the UK six weeks before). The blazing bonfires and floodlit public buildings that illuminated VE night lit up a country eager to leave the war behind. Yet many remained trapped in its embrace, including the bereaved, and those whose loved ones were still missing. Recently released prisoners of war, returned home with disconcerting speed, were baffled by the contrast with their life behind the wire.Millions of Britons were still away from their homes, including about 400,000 men serving in India and south-east Asia, and tens of thousands more with the huge British fleet now serving alongside its vastly more powerful American allies in the Pacific. The war with Japan was then expected to last about another 18 months. The prospect of further service in the Far East loomed over those who had just fought in Europe, and those already in action against the Japanese had little reason to celebrate. As one soldier, recording a filmed message to his family from Burma, put it: “Take a good look at me, you’ll not be seeing me for a long time.”The absence of so many in uniform was just one of the changes wrought by the war. The “warfare state”, brought into being by inter-war international insecurity, had packed on centralised muscle during the conflict, not least via an extraordinary expansion in its tax base. Increased employment and higher pay meant most households were earning more than ever before, but austere restrictions on civilian supplies meant that they could not enjoy the living standards such prosperity would have brought a decade before. More than 1.75 million overseas servicemen, above all Americans, had passed through the UK during the war. With 500,000 houses destroyed and 4 million damaged by enemy bombing, the country’s urban landscapes remained deeply scarred.In other ways, it was the continuities that stood out. Compared to other European combatants, the UK had not been occupied by enemy armies and had maintained its food supplies throughout the war. Its grim death toll – more than a third of a million Britons killed in the European war – was much lighter. The UK also remained relatively very wealthy, though that prosperity now depended in part on its ability to control the debts it owed to the countries – above all India and Egypt – from which it had borrowed to fight the war. Urgent wartime need had made it utterly dependent on US economic aid, not just to maintain its munition supplies but now to manage the transition to peace.Since 1944, resentment at burgeoning American power – and the hope that past sacrifices might leverage future help – had encouraged public assertions of how much Britain alone had done. In the speeches Winston Churchill and King George VI made to the country on VE Day, we can read this morphing of wartime celebrations of allied effort into a postwar emphasis on national exceptionalism and pride. Looking back to 1940, the prime minister reminded listeners to his radio address that “we, from this island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle single-handed for a whole year”. “In defending ourselves,” the King told his people that evening, “we were defending the liberties of the whole world.”Speaking from the balcony of the Ministry of Health in Whitehall that evening, Churchill also told the crowds that they had all been in it together: that it was “not a victory of a party or of any class”, but “the great British nation as a whole”. Not least because of the need to keep the country together as it generated the enormous effort required for victory, however, the war had created a political moment very different from that of the decade before. Labour’s entry into Churchill’s coalition government, the need to counter the totalitarian threat and popular hopes for a better, more secure and fairer life after the war, had all generated a political momentum for reconstruction that the prime minister failed to grasp.Looking forward to the power to determine the country’s postwar direction, by the spring of 1945, both the Labour and Conservative parties were readying themselves for a contest as soon as hostilities in Europe came to an end. Habituated to power, coalition ministers pondered a continued national government to see the country through the rest of the war against Japan, as well as the tremendous difficulties that they knew would shape the first years of peace. The temptations of victory were too strong. Two weeks after the VE Day celebrations were complete, the country was tipped into a general election campaign.To widespread surprise, the result was a landslide that allowed Labour to form its first majority government. And that, in turn, would mean that 1945 was remembered not just as a moment of military victory but also of decisive political change. Over the years that followed, as it strove to impose a new settlement at home, that government would be almost engulfed by economic, imperial and international crises as the war’s impacts continued to reverberate around the world. VE Day might have marked the end of the struggle against Hitler, but the story of Britain’s war was far from finished.Daniel Todman is Professor of Modern History at Queen Mary University of London and author of Britain’s War: A New World, 1942-1947."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001720877450b700af222f77335b44daae149bbd/0_26_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a89a8534611965ffe013c7c9c830025","title":"global summit hopes to raise 82bn for coronavirus vaccine","story":"Aim is to streamline and coordinate research and ensure poorer countries also benefitA global alliance of world leaders, potentially including China and the US, is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (£6.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic.It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them.National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world’s economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost.Monday’s fundraising summit meeting, coming after the concept was launched at a previous summit on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization.The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, has been urged to support the summit. The organisers were optimistic that the US might relent and join the initiative.Melinda Gates, a critic of the absence of US leadership on global health, has warned: “If there is Covid anywhere, there is Covid everywhere. If vaccinations are not distributed everywhere, relapses can occur everywhere”.The UK strongly supports the project and attended the 24 April event.The initiative is designed to broaden the work of an existing organisation, set up in 2017 in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, known as the Global Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations focused on vaccine research. The new body will have a remit to include testing and therapies for those with the disease.The leaders hope to follow the model of the Global Vaccine and Immunisation Alliance (Gavi), which has negotiated with companies that develop vaccines for 20 years, lowering the price by guaranteeing long-term markets and large volumes. Gavi has helped fund the immunisation of 20 million children worldwide.A global pandemic board, operating independently, but in partnership with the World Health Organization, will have the support of the G20 group of countries. Separate subgroups will be set up to coordinate work on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Sir Andrew Whitty, the former chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, has agreed to be a special envoy for the group.The aim is to funnel research into five or six vaccines before moving towards mass manufacturing of the two that show the most promise. The WHO estimates as many as 89 vaccines are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and some therapeutics are in clinical trials. To hasten the process, the group aims to subsidise manufacture of drugs before final clinical trials are complete. The final costs could be as high as $40bn..The launch meeting last week agreed on the principles of Covid therapeutics research sharing and equitable distribution.A joint call for action that also backs the role of the WHO has been signed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, European Council, president Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. All three EU national leaders have experienced a surge in popularity since the crisis started, but now face the difficulty of managing an easing of the lockdown without a ready vaccine.Their pre-summit joint statement says the aim is to “bring together the world’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/414f5bb856e332d235bafa98b252add4e4424bef/0_120_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a1b03118d5bf387c45ebb2c3e2a8088","title":"russian author defends gulag era story as tv series provokes backlash","story":"Literary star Guzel Yakhina shocked by emotional ‘cabin fever’ response to dramatisation The Russian novelist Guzel Yakhina had learned to live with the persistent buzz of controversy surrounding her bestselling debut novel, Zuleikha Opens Her Eyes.Her coming-of-age story of a young woman deported to Siberia during the Stalin-era purges of wealthier peasants, or kulaks, had been picked over for its portrayals of Soviet repressions and national identity in the largely Muslim region of Tatarstan ever since it was published in 2015.But when an eight-part television adaptation was broadcast on state television last month, even she was shocked by the ferocity of the backlash.“I was totally unprepared for this wave of emotional response,” Yakhina told the Observer. “I understood this was something really serious.”In an interview last week, she defended the television series, which she said had faithfully reflected the “tragedy of dekulakisation” without descending into melodrama.But the attacks have poured in from all sides. Communists said the film desecrated the memory of the Soviet past, exaggerating even Stalin-era abuses. Muslim leaders bristled at a sex scene in a mosque and the use of the names of prominent Muslim figures among the exiles. Tatar critics have attacked the romance between Zuleikha and Ignatov, the committed Communist soldier who kills Zuleikha’s first husband.And Chulpan Khamatova, an ethnic Tatar actress who plays the film’s title role, said that she’d received a torrent of online abuse for “defiling the memory of my motherland. Meaning not only Tatarstan, but the history of modern Russia.”For Yakhina, a rising star of Russian literature who has set her first two novels in the upheaval of the 1920s and 30s Soviet Union, the backlash is a sign of just how thorny that past remains, even when the facts and figures of the millions purged and killed under Stalin are a matter of public record.“If this topic were not so painful, the emotional response would not be so strong,” Yakhina said. “I think that we are still processing our past and it will take a long time. Thirty years ago, when the Soviet Union had just collapsed, we thought that we could leave everything behind and move into the new, bright future. But we’re still working our way through the past.”Speaking from her home in Moscow, Yakhina said she thought the emotional response had also been driven by a national bout of cabin fever. Russians remain under lockdown orders aimed at stalling Covid-19, which has infected more than 124,000 people in the country.“It’s an atmosphere of vital fear for one’s life,” Yakhina said. “It’s life under self-isolation and all our feelings are more intense.”But there are also signs of renewed interest in Stalin-era acts of repression among young Russians, including a 2019 YouTube documentary by the journalist Yury Dud about Kolyma, the site of a large Soviet-era Gulag camp, that became a breakaway hit with more than 20 million views.Yakhina says that Russians are “not just ready, they want to remember a lot”. She regularly receives letters from family members inspired to share the stories of their relatives caught up in the purges of the 20s and 30s, she said.“I am really sorry that behind these angry voices, we can’t see the big, positive wave of voices in support,” Yakhina said. “Kind voices are usually quiet. They aren’t seen or heard. But there are many of them.”The stories in the novel are loosely inspired by Yakhina’s grandmother, who was exiled as a child to Siberia and returned “as a grown woman… hardened, with a tough character… she was a very free woman, a very self-sufficient woman. I understood that these features had been forged in Siberia.”Despite sparking political arguments, she says she wasn’t seeking to teach her audiences about the Soviet era or make a political statement. Zuleikha’s story mirrored her mother’s, she said, or could vaguely mirror her own, as a young woman from Tatarstan who emigrated to another culture when she moved to Moscow.“This was a story whose origins were about women, about female metamorphosis, about female liberation. That this story elicited such political arguments… it was never thought of as a political declaration,” she said.Some of the most painful stories come from the lived experience of Yakhina’s grandmother. One, recounted in the film, shows a barge sinking with hundreds of exiles on board, locked in because an army officer has bolted the door. Other vignettes are recovered from memoirs and other excerpts from official histories of the exiles. Ultimately, she said, she didn’t believe she was saying anything that wasn’t available in a textbook.“I have deep sympathy for anyone who lived in this period of history,” she said. “It is unacceptable to condemn them. What is needed is sympathy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f28084a3eb72748b41c99520cddcd5f8ed5012/0_60_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=639cc5f05ae6e96b640b4e232ff563dd","title":"uk lockdown must not be lifted until covid 19 transmission is understood say scientists","story":"Studies into spread of the disease will centre on those working in the health and social care sectors as cases continue to riseBritish scientists are racing to try to answer fundamental questions about the Covid-19 virus and its transmission before the lifting of the current national lockdown is approved by the government in the near future. Researchers say relaxing social distancing should occur only once it is understood why new infections of the disease are still being diagnosed in their thousands every day.Such a rate means efforts to test and trace infected contacts – a key plank in the government’s anti-Covid strategy in coming months – would be quickly overwhelmed. Far more information is needed about the way the coronavirus is transmitted, they say. The new data will feed into the debate about the settings in which lockdown will be lifted first – for instance, whether it’s relatively safe to stage outdoor events.And last week, several groups launched studies aimed at providing answers. These include projects to analyse how virus-laden aerosols behave in the air in a bid to understand how the disease is passed between humans. In addition, other schemes will target healthcare workers to investigate how the virus is being spread to them from patients and then on to others.The importance of this latter approach was revealed in recent figures for cases of Covid-19 which have shown a drop in numbers of new cases in hospitals but reveal significant rises among health and social care workers.This point was stressed by epidemiologist Anne Johnson at University College London. She said cutting transmissions of Covid-19 to health and social care workers had now emerged as a major priority. “Half of all new infections reported last week were among healthcare workers,” she told the Observer. “This has now become the leading edge of the spread of the disease.”Lack of protective equipment and clothing may have worsened the situation, she added. “However, what is certain is that care workers are still at risk from their patients from whom they can pick up the virus and, in turn, pass it on to their colleagues, to their own families and possibly to other patients. We need to focus on limiting the spread of Covid-19 among health and social care workers as an absolute priority if we want to have a chance of bringing this epidemic to a halt.”This view was backed by infectious diseases expert Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “The numbers show that the rate of decline of new cases is slower in the UK than other European countries and that is likely to be down to transmission occurring within health and social care settings, transmission in the community despite social distancing and, to a lesser extent, chains of transmission that are still occurring within households, especially in larger households or shared accommodation.”Last week, researchers at Bristol University launched a major study aimed at finding out precisely how health workers are being infected by the Covid-19 virus. “We have taken a group of 130 health workers and we are going to test them intensively over the next three months,” said Professor Adam Finn, the leader of the project.“We will take swabs from them twice a week, take blood samples regularly, and catalogue their symptoms – in the expectation that some of them will become infected. Then we will be able to find out when they became infected how that relates to their symptoms at the time and how it relates to their immune response. We are going to uncover details of the disease’s natural history because none of this information is known in detail. On the other hand, it is vitally important if we are to understand how this disease behaves.”Finn said current modelling of the disease – although superb – was based on assumptions. “Essentially, the models are guesswork about the way the virus behaves. To get rid of the guesswork we need to supply evidence about how the virus actually behaves.”A different approach is being taken by another Bristol University group, led by chemist, Professor Jonathan Reid. His team is studying the way the Covid-19 virus is passed from one person to another. This happens when fairly large droplets are coughed up or sneezed out by infected people. However, it is also possible viruses may be spread by much smaller aerosol particles – although it is unclear if they can carry enough virus to be infectious.“It is clearly important to find out because aerosols can travel much further than heavier droplets,” said Reid. His team has just constructed a high-containment, automated laboratory containing a device in which clouds of virus-laden aerosol particles can be suspended while researchers alter temperature, humidity, ozone, levels of sunlight and other variables.“In this way we can study how the virus’s infectivity changes,” added Reid. “That might tell us if it is affected by heat. If it is there might be some seasonality to this epidemic. We could also get a better idea of how to run air conditioning in hospitals, care homes and public spaces – in terms of temperature or humidity – in order to reduce the lifetime of the virus so that exposure to it is reduced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c41416718843cfaac059f9d888bcdc6894d7e54/0_149_5326_3197/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6acd28ccaf2b23b9f018618572fc51c","title":"work times could be staggered to help end covid 19 lockdown says shapps","story":"Minister discusses ways to stop transport being overwhelmed during Covid-19 crisisWork start times for the public could be staggered and one-way systems for commuters put in place to avoid overwhelming the transport system when lockdown restrictions are eventually eased, the transport secretary has said.Grant Shapps also suggested that the government was considering measures to encourage workers to take “active transport”: cycling or walking to work.He said there were no immediate plans to alter physical distancing measures to tackle the spread of the coronavirus when the government reviews its latest lockdown phase by Thursday. But as part of the plan to get people back into work, public transport could be closely regulated to prevent a renewed surge in cases of the disease.Trains, buses and transport interchanges could also be equipped with hand sanitiser, as hand-washing remained more important than wearing face masks, he suggested.“We can help with that by trying to have hand sanitisers,” he said. “One-way systems, spacings on platforms and at bus stops and that’s something that’s clearly marked out.”He ruled out temperature checks for people using public transport, saying that if anyone had a temperature they should be at home and not travelling at all.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:England’s soaring rate of excess mortality compared with other European countries was shown to him during the programme but he dismissed it as not giving a true indication of the complex nature of the virus’s impact.It was put to him that considering the number of deaths a week above the normal average, England’s line was far higher and still rising.Asked whether the government had failed to keep the deaths down, he replied that the point the government’s chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, would make is “actually, you need to look at that over a much longer period of time. So we’d have to look back over a year.“It’s much more complex than you’re making it sound for the simple reason that there are other factors to take into account on excess mortalities which we won’t know about today. For example, what does it do in terms of other illnesses and diseases and what was the impact?”He said the demographics of a country, obesity rate, geography and population density would also have an impact on interpreting excess mortality.Statistician David Spiegelhalter told the  that making international comparisons was complex and it was too early to attempt to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

Photograph: Frank MillerFileDuring his television address unveiling the plan Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said schools and colleges would not reopen until SeptemberOctober for the start of the new academic year.He did not offer additional details, but education sources say this likely means a later start to the academic year in most cases. On the Late Late Show, Mr Varadkar said it was still “the plan” to start the Leaving Cert on July 29th.The absence of a reference to the exams in the Government’s roadmap for easing restrictions has been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of fresh uncertainty over whether they will go ahead.However, a spokesman for the Department of Education said the Government is still planning to proceed with two weeks of school in July for Leaving Cert students, ahead of the scheduled start of the exams on July 29th.“Planning for the Leaving Cert is still being discussed, including through the advisory group set up by the department involving education stakeholders. It is still hoped to bring just Leaving Cert students back in July, subject to adequate planning and public health advice,” the spokesman said.However, Mr Byrne said in a statement on Saturday: “This document contains details about the phased reopening of certain sectors and industry, and sets out dates for the proposed lifting of certain restrictions but not once is the Leaving Cert mentioned. I believe this is a huge oversight and it has added to the already heightened anxiety among Leaving Cert students.He said it was unfair to underestimate the stress students are feeling as the uncertainty about their exams. “I believe the Government cannot continue to adopt this wait and see approach with the Leaving Cert. It is becoming clearer with every week that passes that it is simply not tenable for it to proceed.”Mr Byrne said he had discussed alternatives with some universities and with Mr McHugh, adding: “They do exist and we must now switch our focus to them.

Illustration: Michael VineyRocking in my rocking chair – which is what they’re for – I looked out through the branches of the big willow tree and there, framed in a distant triangle of twigs, our neighbour’s children were out-rocking me on their garden swings.On the television in the corner, Andrew Marr was quizzing David Attenborough about his latest, perhaps his last, and undoubtedly his most passionate film, A Life on Our Planet. It frames his view of humankind’s “last chance” at living on Earth.“Our lot,” said Attenborough (93), “are finished anyway. “It’s up to the young to do things better.” “Some people,” Marr offered, “think that Covid-19 could be the reckoning the human world deserves.” Attenborough backed off from anything so biblical. He countered merely that a densely living, overpopulated species was much more susceptible to plagues.His film, soon for Netflix, is apparently a properly terrifying catalogue of what we’ve been doing to the natural world. For all the years of brilliant films exploring and celebrating nature, he or his producers were slow to invite much public outrage about the darker destructions.Attenborough’s recent Blue Planet II, with its nightmare of plastic in the ocean, was the one that really touched some anger. What, Marr asked, was the one bit of change that ordinary people could effect. “Waste!” was Attenborough’s explosive reply.Veteran willowA breeze stirred the willow twigs and their first fringe of green. As the old tree drops her catkins, flushing fully into life, I’ll lose the playing children, along with the view of the mountain and the rising of the moon.It’s quite a veteran as willows go, couched in the stream’s ravine, its elbows propped on the banks. Nowhere else on the hillside could it possibly exist, so safe from people, from sheep and the worst of storms.But willows are everywhere on this soggy island – at least 18 kinds that botanists can ine, often with some difficulty. A tree that reached here naturally in perhaps six or seven forms has been added to by garden introductions and multiple hybridisations.If we had to choose one as the national tree (as I think it richly deserves), it should probably be the common “goat” or “pussy’ willow, Salix caprea. Like the one in my painting, it is ablaze with yellow catkins in early spring. The “goat” stems from an early role as fodder, and the flowers still offer nectar to bumblebee queens fresh out from hibernation. In the sort of little cameo captured by many readers alert to events in their gardens, Paul Dunne, of Lettermore in Co Galway, sent a photograph of ants perched on willow catkins and wondered how unusual this was.They had climbed the tree, he surmised, for pollen or nectar. But the ascent of ants on willows, in particular, is a well-known phenomenon. The ants’ attraction is more usually for aphids, or rather, the sweet liquid known as “honeydew” exuding from their fundaments.This sugary waste is extruded from the aphids’ extraction of sap in the willow’s youngest, most tender, shoots. Googling “ants on willows” offers a graphic Flickr close-up of ants in close attendance.No aphids appear on Dunne’s catkins, but bluetits I see foraging along flowering twigs of our own willow confirm that they abound. A score or more of different species suck at the shoots of sallies in these islands, and since the salicin in willows converts to salicylic acid, a natural aspirin, one may wonder if both aphids and ants are seeking to be spaced out.Of far more urgent consequence in the appetite of aphids is that of the grain aphid, Sitobion avanae. It sucks at the sap of spring-sown barley seedlings, barely greening the field, and flies around to spread the dreaded “yellow dwarf virus”. It is also evolving resistance to pyrethroids, the chemical ingredients of most modern pesticides.Teagasc, the farmers’ oracle, has long encouraged “integrated pest management”. Its advice at the national tillage conference in January was to sow early and spray once “if warranted”.Several sparrowsFor better news, my recent column on the reported decline of urban house sparrows brought many reassuring emails from readers with abundant chirping residents. This ties in well with the latest Big Garden Watch survey of the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. From returns by nearly half a million people in late January, the house sparrow was the most commonly seen (or, perhaps, readily recognised) garden bird. With new mild winters to help survival, the society hopes “that at least a partial recovery may be happening”."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243886.1588504876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third flight of u2 bought ppe for health workers lands in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe shipment is the latest in a series of consignments paid for by U2 from a €10 million donationA third flight carrying two million face masks and 32,000 surgical gowns for Irish healthcare workers, purchased by rock band U2, landed at Dublin Airport from China on Sunday morning.The shipment is the latest in a series of consignments paid for by the Dublin musicians from a €10 million donation, sourced from Chinese suppliers by Cork businessman Liam Casey of PCH International and flown back on a flight organised by Dublin aircraft leasing company Avolon.The flight, an Airbus A330, arrived in Dublin Airport from Shenzhen in China on Sunday morning with the cargo belly space underneath and passenger cabin containing the personal protective equipment (PPE).The cargo of 2.1 million “Type IIR” surgical face masks and surgical gowns, said to be a priority for the Health Service Executive (HSE), will be delivered to the health service for distribution.This is the third and last flight organised by Avolon, funded by donations from the firm and its staff, corporate donors and members of public through a €350,000 crowdfunding campaign.U2 and Mr Casey, a 24-year veteran of running manufacturing operations out of China, plan to continue sourcing and purchasing more PPE for Irish healthcare workers and shipping the equipment on more flights in the weeks ahead.The supply of PPE continues to be a critical for frontline healthcare workers and others in fight against coronavirus as countries rush to maintain adequate supplies.More than 6.6 million items of PPE were delivered across the health service last week.Paul Reid, chief executive of the HSE, said last month that the supply of PPE continued to be challenging and that supplies were like “gold dust” with “elements of kind of modern-day piracy going on” as other parties attempt to out-bid an order secured for the Irish health service.Second batchThe HSE had accelerated deliveries of its own PPE from Chinese suppliers and that it had consolidated more deliveries into a second batch, increasing the size of its order to cover equipment worth €130 million. The HSE is spending more than €200 million in all on PPE.Avolon last week sent a note donors to its fully subscribed online crowdfunding campaign that paid for the charter of aircraft for the second and third flights.The note said that the company had transported a total of more than four million pieces of PPE on the three flights over the three previous weeks.The second and third flights contained protective equipment purchased by U2. The first flight, which landed on April 7th, contained a mix shipment of PPE purchased by the band, the HSE and by Avolon itself.The three consignments comprised 2.65 million surgical masks, 1.1 million protective gloves, 120,500 medical goggles, 100 face shields, the 32,000 surgical gowns and 40 ventilators.Among the donors to Avolon’s fundraising campaign were Aircraft Leasing Ireland, the representative body for the industry, the Irish ision of Standard Chartered Bank who gave €50,000, and an Irish businessman, who did not wish to be identified, who also donated €50,000.Domhnál Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, told The  that the company was “shocked at the speed and depth of the giving,” from big corporate donations to small sums from iniduals.“Normally whenever we do a fundraiser, you pick up the phone to your cronies and say, ‘give me a few quid.’ Over a period of 72 hours, we had hundred and hundreds of 20, 10 and 5 quid donations, people we have no connection with. That is what overwhelmed us,” he said.Mr Slattery praised the collaborative efforts of all parties involved and the capacity of Irish networking, particularly Bono’s international contacts in politics and business and Mr Casey’s knowledge of China, to source, buy and ship much sought-after PPE during a pandemic.“It was U2’s money, Liam Casey’s buying power and our ability on the logistics,” he said.“That then stretched to, ‘well, let’s get everyone to put in a few quid,’ so there is a holistic harmony on the whole thing.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"10,000 Susi applications within a day of opening for grants in 202021 academic yearApplications still being processed as commanders assess skill gapsIreland cannot emerge from crisis \u0026lsquowith three separate welfare groups\u0026rsquoFormer UUP leader Mike Nesbitt apologises for breaking lockdown restrictionsPro-Remain parties in Northern Ireland criticise \u0026lsquopetty\u0026rsquo decision by UK governmentPaul Reid says he expects three-day turnaround in test results by May 18thIrish company addresses \u0026lsquomisleading\u0026rsquo statements over hiring of staff from outside State\u0026lsquoFull internal review\u0026rsquo being carried out Mullingar Regional HospitalData suggests asymptomatic transmission could account for a \u0026lsquosignificant proportion\u0026rsquo of casesPlane carrying 2.1 million face masks and 32,000 surgical gowns arrives from ChinaTwo men arrested after incident in Co Louth townMan (50s) taken to Beaumont Hospital with head injuries after incident on SaturdayTotal of 1,286 have now died of Covid-19 in the RepublicFox seen looking mournfully towards Merrion Square where parents liveMan (40s) was detained following an apparent stabbing in Enniscorthy on FridayHSE declines to disclose rate paid to recruitment firm CPL hired to manage processCol Ringrose, who has died aged 89, described as an \u0026lsquoexemplary ambassador\u0026rsquo for IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243838.1588451030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meet sam the resourceful young fox that has made dublin city centre its home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin for Sam:  the capital’s fox having its breakfast on Friday. Photograph: Paul LaniganOn Friday morning, photographer Paul Lanigan ventured into Dublin city centre with the intention of taking photographs of empty streets during the Covid-19 pandemic.The streets were empty alright, but of humans, not a fox which ambled down Fleet Street in Temple Bar with its breakfast in its mouth. The time was 9am when the street would normally be full of delivery trucks and tourists on an early morning stroll.“I never thought I would see a fox in daylight, especially at 9am. It didn’t seem possible,” Mr Lanigan said.He approached the fox carefully. Fortunately the animal was preoccupied with the pigeon in its mouth. Mr Lanigan got his photograph.It is the same fox that was filmed on Grafton Street last week strolling in the early afternoon in a thoroughfare that would normally be thronged with shoppers.The fox has a name. It’s Sam, according to Trinity College Dublin zoologist Collie Ennis, a suitably androgenous name as nobody who has observed the fox can tell at this stage if it is a dog (male) or a vixen (female).It is about 11 months old, he reckons, and has a mangey tail. Mr Ennis said Sam’s parents inhabit a territory around Merrion Square.Now that Sam has reached a certain age, it has been kicked out of the den, and unlike its human equivalents, cannot plead that the rents in Dublin city centre are too exorbitant.“All the time now at Trinity, you see him sitting at Lincoln Place gate at the dental hospital mournfully looking towards where Mammy and Daddy hang around. That’s why he’s out and about in the city centre during the day looking a bit panicked,” explains Mr Ennis.“We were concerned that he was not eating, but we can see from the photograph that there is no need to be concerned. They are incredibly adaptable animals. They can switch from McDonald’s leftovers to killing rats and pigeons within days which is exactly what happened.”UCD zoologist and PhD student Holly English says Sam looks like a healthy young adult fox who is fully grown though it is not possible to discern the sex of the animal from the photograph.She says the pictures demonstrates how foxes are the “ultimate opportunists” and are excellent scavengers.“I think based on commentary I’ve seen online, some people are worried that foxes in the city centre have less to eat these days because the restaurants and everything are closed,” she said.“But this photo is a fine example that foxes are wild animals and well able to find food on their own. They’re excellent predators.

Cubs, which were born the previous year will often help out their parents in scavenging for food for the new arrivals.She believes that the increased sightings of foxes in city centre locations during daylight hours is related to the lockdown.“They are more nocturnal. These day-time sightings are connected to the number of people out and about.”She had hoped to get some special collars put on Dublin’s foxes so we can get a better idea of what size their territories are in the city and learn more about their behaviour, but that activity has been suspended because of the lockdown.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243939.1588511702!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain rejects request for permanent eu office in belfast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove wrote to his the SDLP, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Greens saying that an EU office in Belfast was unnecessary. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has rejected a request from pro-Remain parties in Northern Ireland for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast, it has emerged.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood confirmed on Sunday that British cabinet office minister Michael Gove wrote to his party, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Greens saying that such an office was unnecessary.Mr Eastwood accused the British government of acting in a “petty” but “unsurprising” manner.Mr Gove was responding to a letter the four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson in April calling for a permanent EU office in Belfast.Mr Gove said it would facilitate where necessary ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK left the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove responding on behalf of Mr Johnson appears to have closed down on that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast, but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.RTÉ reported that the UK told the EU in February last year it wished to maintain an EU office in Belfast after Brexit.Now, however, it has changed its position by flatly rejecting the request for an office.“I think this is typical of the childish approach adopted by the British government during these (Brexit) negotiations,” said Mr Eastwood.“The people who ran the Leave campaign are now running the British government and they have no understanding of the situation unique to Northern Ireland, and they seem to not care at all that people here don’t want to leave the European Union,” he said.“It is petty, but it is unsurprising.”In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.Mr Eastwood said it was also “bizarre” that the British government still appeared determined to fully exit the EU by the end of the year rather than seek an extension when “all the machinery of government should be focussed on dealing with coronavirus”.Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, also described the office decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the IrelandNorthern Ireland Protocol seriously,” she said.“We find the stance of the UK government to an EU office in Northern Ireland as petty and counterproductive. Fundamentally, it is at odds with the letter and spirit of the withdrawal agreement,” she said.“An ongoing EU presence in Northern Ireland will be essential to the operation of the protocol (designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland).”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK - and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.“The intent of the protocol should be for our own UK staff to do the work and in the spirit of cooperation that all sides say they want to achieve, our government’s proposals of EU officials flying in to monitor to see if best practices is achieved, on an occasional basis, should more than suffice,” said Mr Aiken.“It is more than regrettable that what should be a simple administrative arrangement is being used as a ‘bargaining’ chip, with Northern Ireland in the middle again.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA The State will be able to support businesses and people facing financial difficulty for “a period of time” but cannot make “massive” financial commitments indefinitely, the Minister for Finance has said.Paschal Donohoe said on Sunday that the Government must strike a balance between affordability and support packages in order to avoid three separate welfare groups emerging from the Covid-19 crisis.“We need to make sure we don’t end up with one group of people who are receiving a set of payments they got before the disease hit us another group of people who were receiving the pandemic unemployment payment and then a third group who might become unemployed at some point in the future,” Mr Donohoe said on RTÉ’s This Week programme.He said that over time the Government would need to “balance our books again” but because of the financial stability prior to the pandemic the State could maintain support schemes for a period of time. However, he acknowledged that it would become difficult to continue these supports if the economy did not start to grow again in the future.At the start of the crisis, the Government introduced a wage subsidy scheme that that supported companies to keep people in jobs and a pandemic welfare payment of €350 per week for those who lost their jobs. However, in recent weeks, Mr Donohoe has indicated that the Government would consider “tapering and changing” the special €350 pandemic payment when the initial 12-week period runs out in mid-June.Mr Donohoe unveiled on Saturday a series of measures worth up to €6.5 billion to help businesses impacted by Covid-19 including a commercial rates holiday. Up to €2 billion in State-backed loans is also to be made available for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The loans will range from €10,000 to €1 million and will be 80 per cent guaranteed by the State and offered at below market rates.“The schemes that we are discussing here are costing many hundreds of millions of euros per week and this is a balance and a decision that we are going to try and get right and I believe we will get it right across the coming weeks,” said the minister on Sunday.The Government is aiming to “synchronize” the re-opening of the Irish economy with “a growing confidence regarding where we are with the disease,” said Mr Donohoe.He added that he was “reasonably certain” legislation on the management of tax liabilities and the installation of a credit guarantee scheme for new lending would be passed in June or July.On the high cost of rents for businesses, the minister said he had called on commercial landlords to remain cognizant of how different the Irish economy will be as the State emerges from the pandemic.Asked to comment on the legitimacy of the current Government given the results of the February election, Mr Donohoe underlined that without the cabinet decision made in recent weeks, more than one million people would be on the live register while business difficulties would be “far, far worse”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"US secretary of state refuses to discuss if Kim Jong Un gravely ill over the last few weeksUnited Nations warns authorities against detaining people in overcrowded centresNorth Korean leader reportedly attends event after speculation about healthChen Jieren has been detained since 2018 after he published two blog articles claiming corruption by Hunan party officialsRescheduled general assembly to take place next month against backdrop of coronavirusHundreds of firefighters tackle blaze in new warehouse in city of IncheonBeijing mounting \u0026lsquono-holds-barred\u0026rsquo diplomatic effort to stem growing calls for compensationReports of North Korean leader\u0026rsquos illness expose limits of foreign insight into countryPM says it will be weeks before movement restrictions lifted and some could be reintroducedKim Yo-jong was a favourite of her late father and is reported to have been groomed for the roleLockdown restrictions eased as community transmission eliminated, but Ardern warns fight not over\u0026lsquoNo suspicious movements\u0026rsquo detected in North Korea as conjecture grows over leader\u0026rsquos absenceWhile the number of new coronavirus cases has begun to fall, experts say the rate of change is not as fast as expectedIn recent years China has sought to expand its control over the region by building artificial islands around reefs and atollsSouth Korea reiterates that it has detected \u0026lsquonothing unusual\u0026rsquo in the NorthSecondary school students told to arrive early for temperature checksContribution comes days after Washington said the US would freeze funding to WHOHardline clerics calling the shots and urging devotees to ignore anti-pandemic measuresLatest cases raise concern about potential impact on Nagasaki residentsSouth Korea\u0026rsquos presidential Blue House says no unusual signs coming from neighbourStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242166.1588270051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north netherlands stopped following national advice here s what happened","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn intensive care patient is moved from an air ambulance at the University Medical Center in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Robin UtrechtEchoes WireBarcroft Media via GettyAccording to the official Dutch count, there have been 4,795 coronavirus deaths in the Netherlands. This is an underestimate: it only includes people who tested positive, and mortality data suggests actual deaths are 40 per cent higher. It also disguises deep regional differences.In the worst-hit region of North Brabant in the south, twice as many people died between March 16th and April 5th, 2020, than in the same period last year. But in the northern region of Groningen, home to a university city the size of Cork, deaths were just 4 per cent higher in the same period.What can explain this stark difference in a country half the size of Ireland that is one of the most densely populated in the world?The man held partly responsible is Prof\u0026nbspAlex Friedrich, a virologist and head of microbiology and infection control at\u0026nbspthe University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the major hub of medical care in the northern Netherlands.Friedrich announced on March 19th that the north was departing from national Dutch policy. While the public health agency would be restricting testing to only severe and priority cases, he announced the north would follow\u0026nbspthe World Health Organisation’s advice: “test test test”.\u0026nbsp“In the Netherlands, in our country, they said that diagnostics is interesting for statistics but not important for the fight against the disease. There I strongly disagree,” Friedrich told The .The UMCG set up a test centre on its grounds, hired medical students for extra staff, and asked the local health authorities to direct people there for screening.\u0026nbsp“We just did it,” Friedrich recalled. “You save lives by doing diagnostics. Proper diagnostics, case tracing, information, is one of the strongest weapons we have to fight the virus.”International insightCrucial to the decision-making was an international perspective. Friedrich did not rely on the limited academic studies available on the new virus, but directly telephoned doctors in Italy to ask what they were seeing in their patients.He learned they were spending twice as long in intensive care than Dutch national modelling accounted for, and he adapted the hospital’s plans accordingly. Friedrich maintains that learning from the experience of other countries is crucial to fighting the pandemic.This insight was important, but so was luck.School holidays in the Netherlands are staggered. The north had theirs a week earlier than the rest of the country. It meant that Dutch people from the south and west were much more likely to bring coronavirus home from skiing holidays in Austria and Italy, as they travelled when outbreaks there were more widespread. This was compounded by the mass public events of carnival season, which are held in the south but not the north.This meant when the Dutch government finally began banning public events on March 10th, it was too late for Brabant, but not for Groningen, according to Friedrich.“We talked to the public health service and said we are going to do something different from the national way,” he recalled.A few initial detected cases in Groningen were health workers who had travelled abroad. But soon\u0026nbsptests were discovering Covid-19 in health workers who had travelled only to other regions of the Netherlands.“We realised there was no difference anymore between the south and the west of the Netherlands and northern Italy. So we told our staff: you are not allowed to go outside our region, and if you do so you cannot come to work. You have to stay at home for two weeks,” Friedrich said.With 15,000 staff and as the central healthcare node for the whole region, the UMCG was big enough to set policy for the wider north. According to Friedrich, the decisive intervention was screening healthworkers, whether or not they had symptoms. A fifth of those who tested positive never developed any.“In healthcare institutions, 10, 20 or 30 people can be infected by just one person,” Friedrich said. “In other parts of the country where the numbers are still high, I suspect it is outbreaks in healthcare institutions and long-term care that are the major drivers of the epidemic.”‘Group immunity’Though Friedrich has been part of the outbreak management team that co-ordinates the Dutch response to the crisis, he is critical of aspects of national strategy.On March 16th prime minister Mark Rutte announced that the Netherlands would build “group immunity” by allowing the virus to roam the population in a controlled manner. The government subsequently walked back from this, but the policy still has its adherents.Friedrich is not one of them.“Herd immunity can never be a public health strategy. It can never be controlled, and it means people will die, and if you are not very careful a lot of people will die,” Friedrich said.“It’s not a law that we’re all going to get infected. It’s just the consequences of our insufficient action to protect people.”He has doubts about whether survivors of the disease even reliably built immunity. “Immunity does not happen automatically,” Friedrich said. “It might be very local, in the nose or throat. But then you could swallow the virus, and get an infection in your gut.”Delaying the spread gives doctors and scientists time to understand the disease and develop more effective treatments, which Friedrich believes will emerge more quickly than a vaccine.“For a vaccination you need to produce it for all the billions of people on the planet, which takes time, and you have to administer it,” he explained.“It’s not like a therapy that you give to a sick person: there, you might take into account there are side effects, but consider them acceptable because you have to save a life. If you are giving a vaccination to healthy people all over the world, you need to be very, very sure that this is safe.”His focus now is preparing for the winter, the worst season for respiratory infections. Friedrich expects it to bring a wave of infection that was worse than the first.“We need personal protective equipment, we need more intensive care beds, we need more healthcare staff, we need more diagnostics in all hospitals in the country,” Friedrich said.“You cannot expect things will go back to normal, thinking that normal is the world as it was before February. That is not really realistic. We have to change so that we can handle this.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241997.1588258217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"europe s relationship with china is now one of mistrust and hostility","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tReferring to China, French president Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times last month: ‘There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.’ Photograph: Lintao ZhangGettyAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, relations between the People’s Republic of China, the West and Europe are undergoing a profound transformation, characterised by mistrust and, in some cases, open hostility.The pandemic’s origins in Wuhan, Chinese secrecy about its evolution, and what has been called China’s newly aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy (after a patriotic, Chinese blockbuster film) have accelerated a chill in Sino-European relations that started before the crisis.Early conspiracy theories that suggested coronavirus was a manmade product of biological warfare have been refuted by the scientific community. The hypotheses most widely circulated in the West now are that a scientist in a high-security biological laboratory in Wuhan was accidentally infected and spread the virus, or that one of several labs sloppily disposed of contaminated research materials. China has denounced these theories as “not science-based”.Referring to China, French president Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times last month: “There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.” Clarifying later, the Élysée said Macron referred only to the Chinese government’s lack of transparency.Although US president Donald Trump is widely disliked in Europe, researchers and diplomats say European officials and the public agree with much of what he says about China.Trump continues to be the most strident critic of China’s role in the pandemic. On Monday, he responded\u0026nbspto an editorial in the sensationalist German newspaper Bild that demanded China pay €150 billion in reparations to Germany for the death and economic destruction wreaked by the pandemic.Trump said he would “hold China accountable”, though he hadn’t determined the amount yet. More than one million Americans have been infected with Covid-19 and more than 59,000 have died, a higher toll than the Vietnam War.In late April, the US state of Missouri filed a lawsuit demanding that the Chinese government be “held accountable for their actions”.And in the past week, the Australian government has asked for an international investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) into the origin of the virus. The Chinese ambassador to Canberra disagreed, and threatened a Chinese boycott of Australian universities and tourism sites.China’s deputy ambassador to London, Chen Wen, told BBC radio in recent days that China could not agree to an international investigation. “While we are concentrating all our efforts on fighting against the virus, why talk about an investigation into this?” she asked. “This will ert our attention, our resources. No one can agree with this kind of politically motivated investigation.”Also in April, China’s ambassador to Paris, Lu Shaye, was summoned to the French foreign ministry, a serious step just short of breaking diplomatic relations, for the first time in a quarter century.Lu tweets several times a day regarding Covid-19 issues. He has repeated claims by the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman Zhao Lijian that the virus came from the US. He has alleged that French parliamentarians supported racist Taiwanese comments against the Ethiopian director of the WHO, and accused caregivers in French nursing homes of “abandoning their positions overnight, deserting collectively, and leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease”.“We expect to be respected by China, as they wish to be respected by us,” foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says. In an interview with Le Monde, he described the pandemic as “the continuation of power struggles by other means”. Asked whether he feared that China would take the place of the US in world affairs, Le Drian replied: “My fear is that the world after will furiously resemble the world before, only worse.”Scarcely a day passes without damning reports on China in French media. “The Great Chinese Lie,” was the title of Le Figaro magazine’s 10-page cover story on April 25th, illustrated by a photograph of Xi Jinping wearing a surgical mask and wagging his finger.On the Chinese side, Lu boasted that “China has helped 140 countries and international organisations” in an interview with L’Opinion newspaper.But as noted by the European Think-tank Network on China on April 29th: “It is important to note that commercial deliveries of medical supplies from China have far exceeded aid volumes.”At the beginning of the pandemic, Europe helped China. Then China helped Europe. In February, France sent 17 tonnes of medical supplies to Wuhan, including 560,000 face masks. A month later, China dispatched a “solidarity freight” of one million masks and 10,000 protection suits to Paris. The French health ministry said France subsequently ordered “close to two billion” masks from China.French commentators initially praised the ability of China’s autocratic regime to impose such a draconian lockdown.But the French mood changed in late March, says Marc Julienne, China researcher at the French Institute for International Relations (IFRI). The French found Trump’s allegations of Chinese influence over the WHO convincing, says Julienne. They were skeptical of the low fatality figures reported by China, suspicious of Beijing’s “mask diplomacy”, and outraged by Ambassador Lu’s outbursts.Chinese officials routinely accuse the West of attacking China to hide their own ineptitude in fighting the pandemic. “It wouldn’t have come to this if westerners had been more successful in stopping the epidemic,” Lu told L’Opinion.“If there’s a problem, it’s the fault of certain media,” Lu continued. “They align themselves with American media. Every time the US press makes an allegation, almost immediately French media howl with the wolves.”Lab rumoursThe origin of the virus is particularly sensitive in Paris, because France built one of the Wuhan biological labs whose security practices have been questioned.Wuhan is the most French of Chinese cities, the investigative journalist Antoine Izambard writes in France-China, Dangerous Liaisons, published just before the pandemic. About 100 French companies, including PSA, Eurocopter, L’Oréal and Pernod-Ricard have plants there.When Izambard visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology to interview its director, microbiologist Yuan Zhiming, in February 2019, the walls of the stairs were lined with photographs of French officials.France built the highest security biological laboratory in China there, under a 2004 agreement. An outbreak of Sars had just killed 800 people in Asia. “It was logical for France to give China a tool to help it detect viruses and develop vaccines,” Izambard says.Not everyone was comfortable with this. France had recently lost track of four mobile P3 biological labs it gave China. (P4 stands for pathogen level 4, meaning the most deadly viruses for which no cure has been discovered. P3 and P2 indicate lower levels of lethality and safety precautions.)Military intelligence and the foreign ministry opposed the P4 lab project on the grounds it could be hijacked for biological warfare. (There is no evidence it ever was.) The US also opposed construction of the lab. A French researcher, quoted by Izambard, was upbraided by the US scientific attaché in Beijing. “No P4, no P4. It’s forbidden. You can’t do that!”It went ahead, and has been the subject of rumours and debate for some weeks now.US intelligence says the Covid-19 virus definitely came from China, was not manmade or genetically modified, and that it is still investigating whether it came from a laboratory in Wuhan. On Thursday evening, Donald Trump said he had seen evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source.Yuan and his deputy, Shi Zhengli, have figured prominently in French coverage of the pandemic. Shi wrote her thesis at the University of Montpellier and was later one of a half dozen scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology who trained in biological security in Lyon. In 2016, the French ambassador to Beijing decorated Yuan and Shi with the National Order of Merit and the Legion of Honour for their work in preventing infectious diseases.In 2004, Shi and her team began roaming the caves of southern China, identifying hundreds of bat-borne coronaviruses, as recounted in Scientific American magazine. The magazine published the article this week “to address rumours that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from Shi Zhengli’s lab in China”.The team hung nets at the mouths of caves before dark, then waited for the bats to come out to feed. They took samples of the bats’ blood, saliva, urine and faeces.On the night of December 30th, 2019, Shi received a telephone call from the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a biosafety level 2 lab located less than 300 metres from the seafood market where Chinese authorities claimed the epidemic started. They had found a new coronavirus in two hospital patients and wanted Shi to investigate. “Could they have come from our lab?” Shi asked herself.Questions around the lab had persisted. The Washington Post revealed on April 14th that US diplomats who visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology in January 2018 warned Washington the laboratory was not secure. A cable dated January 19th, 2018 said the new lab “has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.” The cable warned that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses risked creating an epidemic similar to the 2003 Sars outbreak.Shi went through years of lab records, checking for any mishandling of research materials. When it emerged that none of the genome sequences in the Covid-19 virus matched those she had taken from bat caves, it “really took a load off my mind,” Shi told Scientific American.Researchers have now published 4,500 genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Shi says the fact that none exactly matches the viruses she has studied proves that Covid-19 could not have come from her lab.Yuan Zhiming, director of the lab, has said: “It is impossible that the virus came from here. We have very precise and rigorous rules for avoiding leaks and we are certain of that.”In the absence of a full investigation, the truth of this remains unknown and the hypothesis remains just that. Yet unease persists about labs in China.France has no connection with the lower biosafety level Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention lab. According to a report on the ResearchGate website in February, it houses 600 bats captured 1,000km away, in the subtropical Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces.A video posted on YouTube in December showed lab technician Tian Junhua telling how he self-quarantined after coming into contact with bat blood and urine. Such reports, widely covered by French media, prompt a question: could lab personnel have inadvertently been exposed to the Covid-19 virus and brought it into the local population?This speculation, combined with a Chinese attempt to control the narrative of the pandemic, are inflaming French opinion.“Until now, in France, only a few disappointed businesses, a small group of diplomats and high-ranking officials at the ministry of defence objected to the ultra-nationalist and fundamentally opaque behaviour of this country,” Le Monde said in a two-page investigative report into the Wuhan laboratories.Izambard interviewed 140 diplomats, officials and scientists for his book. “France rarely wins,” he says. “In nuclear energy, high-speed railways, aeronautics and biology, China wants the technology, but it doesn’t want co-operation.” Fifty French researchers were supposed to have worked in the P4 lab. There is only one.Crude and clumsyThese days, it is not uncommon to hear criticism of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the unabashedly pro-Chinese former prime minister, and Alain Mérieux, the Lyon industrialist who lobbied for the P4 lab.“What did the French think they were doing when they gave China that lab?” a European diplomat ask a few days ago in Paris.“Xi Jinping wants to impose his narrative of how victorious, glorious, heroic China defeated the virus,” says Françoise Nicolas, director of the Asia Centre at IFRI. “I don’t think he can win this one. It’s too crude, blatant and clumsy. It’s over-confident and aggressive.”Before the pandemic, there was already a widespread belief that China wanted to rule the world, Nicolas says.President Macron has called Beijing’s trillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative to build Chinese roads, ports and industrial centres around the world “hegemonic”.Xi’s Made in China 2025 plan to make China the world leader in fields such as aeronautics and robotics is also viewed with suspicion. A Chinese attempt to take control of Toulouse airport was thwarted. But Greece and Italy allowed China to invest in the ports of Piraeus and Trieste.Reliance on trade with China makes some EU countries skittish. In the third week of April, Beijing put heavy pressure on the EU to water down a report about Covid-19 disinformation, the New York Times reported.For example, the sentence, “China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image,” was removed, as was an account of China’s dispute with France. Monika Richter, an analyst involved in the report, denounced the changes as “appeasement” and accused the EU of “self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party”.The think tank network report on Europe-China relations says the pandemic has “simultaneously brought Europe and China into closer cooperation and pushed them further apart”.The crisis has amplified isions between countries desperate for Chinese aid, such as Italy and Spain, and those like France, Germany and Sweden, who see Chinese behaviour as provocative and aggressive.In March, the European Commission repeated past advice to member states to shelter strategic industries from China. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, says EU governments should buy stakes in companies rather than allow Chinese incursions while prices are low because of the pandemic. France and others have vowed to repatriate strategic industries they outsourced to China.Over four months of the pandemic, “China has lost Europe,” Reinhard Buetikofer, a German Green who heads the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with China, told Bloomberg News.Macron often says that Europe must not become a casualty of rivalry between the US and China.In March 2019, the EU publicly labelled China a “strategic rival” for the first time. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Josep Borrell, the representative for foreign affairs, have made repeated statements about the need for greater transparency on the part of China, and for the EU to protect itself from China.With €700 billion in annual trade pre-pandemic, mutual dependence between China and Europe will not disappear. But interaction will be more difficult after the crisis.“Until now, we let the Chinese walk all over us,” says Françoise Nicolas. “Now the Chinese are more assertive, and we are more wary. This has laid the basis for a tense and complex relationship, on both sides.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Residents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineDecree expected to spare lives of at least six men accused of taking part in Arab SpringCountry to be ided into colour-coded regions based on infection and death ratesMove coincides with Ramadan as Saudis seek to renew UN-mediated peace talksReport shows Kingdom executed 184 people but global number is lowest for 10 yearsNetanyahu and Gantz agree to form emergency coalition to end year of deadlockJob losses have left workers in debt and in limbo after being refused repatriationPrincess Basmah, a human rights advocate, says she is ill and being detainedKnesset could dissolve early next month if current coalition talks end in failureHouse of Saud efforts to contain Covid-19 under scrutiny in Arab and Muslim worldsUS officials say 11 small boats circled six US warships with \u0026lsquoharassing approaches\u0026rsquoDoctors warn of serious outbreak at overcrowded camps near Turkish borderExtension granted after joint request from Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny GantzSuch mass deportations likely to exacerbate spread of Covid-19, UN warnsYemenis at major risk of infection in country that has lost half its hospitals to bombingCoronavirus fears lead to two-week truce, though Houthi rebels yet to officially respondRestrictions have curbed virus but officials warn extension could impact food suppliesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"watch covid 19 teaches us human behaviour","story":"What can our response to pandemics tell us about our social psychologies?

But schools, bars, restaurants, shops and even some cinemas remain open. Instead Swedes have been advised to adopt social distancing measures, rather than ordered by the authorities on pain of a fine.Take those photographs of Swedes enjoying the spring sunshine (see below).“We love being outside whenever we can. But being outside with others is not dangerous if you are more than 1.5m away from each other. In fact it’s very good for you,” Prof. World told The . “The most dangerous thing is to be inside, close to others, because of the way that droplets spread and pass on coronavirus.“Swedes being outside looks different to France, where they are not allowed to be, but if we were all sitting inside it would be far worse for all sorts of health reasons, as well as the spread of Covid.”Prof. Wold, the author of an acclaimed book on parenting the Swedish way, is also worried about the long term impact of the decision in the UK and other countries to shut schools in response to the pandemic.She fears this will not only enforce social ision, with those from disadvantaged homes more adversely affected than children from affluent families, but also places a heavier burden on mothers, many of whom are now having to juggle work with childcare at home.“Closing schools an attitude of ‘get the women and children out of the way and we’ll fight the virus’, but children don’t just disappear. Somebody has to take care of them,” she said.Prof. Wold also said the accepted premise that schools had to close because children with no immunity normally pass on infections to the wider population did not apply.“In general children are more contagious than adults who are fully or partially immune to things like measles and flu. That’s not the case with coronavirus, children are not more contagious, so there is no reason to shut schools,” she said. “Closing schools is disastrous for wider society and it\u0027s bad for the children.”Prof. Wold also disputed the notion that Sweden had deliberately set out to create ‘herd immunity’ by letting the virus run rampant.“It’s never been the policy. Like every other country the strategy has been to protect hospitals from being overwhelmed and to protect the elderly and most vulnerable,” she said. “The difference is in the means Sweden has used to achieve this.”The WHO said it was wrong to think that Sweden had “just let the infection spread”.Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said: “Sweden has set a very strong policy on public health, it is about physical distancing and how to protect the elderly in various nursing homes and much more.“What it has done differently is it has very much relied on its relationship with its citizenry and the ability and willingness of its citizens to implement self-distancing and self-regulate. Sweden represents a future model if we want to return to a society that we do not have to close.”But there has been debate in the country as to whether its approach is the right one, with more than 1,500 doctors and scientists last month calling for a tougher approach.Even the state epidemiologist who has become the public face of the Swedish model has admitted to having constant doubts about it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british lion slow wake does can hear roar","story":"The prime minister would be entirely right to merge in the public mind both VE Day and the reversing of the coronavirus panzers - in fact, the cheesier the better!All being well, on Friday we will be celebrating not just the 75th anniversary of VE Day but also an easing of the lockdown as the ghastly virus death toll diminishes. Let us trust that the Prime Minister – whose instincts are both patriotic and ebullient – will not be able to resist eliding the two. Let us hope some uplifting Churchillian rhetoric is already being rehearsed between feeds in the Downing Street flat. It can be offset perfectly by the Queen’s subtler prose in her evening broadcast.Boris Johnson would be entirely right to merge in the public mind both VE Day and the reversing of the coronavirus panzers. We expect nothing less. The cheesier the better. Not only could we all do with cheering up, the containment of the virus would indeed be a famous victory.But it goes further than that. The handy coincidence of the two is an opportunity to celebrate a renewed faith in our national character, our society and our institutions.The two campaigns share many things in common, notably the mobilising of resources in a vast collective effort. But the most positive feature of both is that the majority of people have simply got on with life, doing their duty, observing the lockdown considerately and without too much complaint, even when the news has not been good.From the safe distance of the 21st Century, we forget that the Second World War was not one continuous, uninterrupted march to victory. Things went wrong, all the time, and the Government made plenty of mistakes. But rather than mutiny, most people had the good sense to know that life is not perfect and they just kept going. In fact, it is this stoicism, this sense of patriotic mutuality which may have been our real competitive advantage over Nazi Germany, which ultimately relied on a contrived ideology as its motivating force. Plus we had better jokes.A particular feature of the British system, which we should all be used to by now, is that what we now call the Establishment always stumbles somewhat complacently into a crisis and gets off to a bad start, before stepping up a gear and dealing with the situation properly.This is what happened in in 1915 when the Shell Crisis exposed a shortage of material at the front and led to David Lloyd George being made Minister for Munitions and in 1940 when Neville Chamberlain was replaced as wartime Prime Minister by Winston Churchill.So it has proved in the great coronavirus campaign. The Government was indeed slow in its actions to start with. There have been wobbles along the way, including the Prime Minister himself being rushed to hospital. But most of us realised from the start that such setbacks are inevitable in a crisis. By holding it together and through the sterling efforts of the NHS, care homes, charities and businesses, we are, slowly but surely, getting there.For that is the thing with the British lion. It is slow to wake, but when it does, you can hear it roar. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Job, who spoke them, was a righteous man who had done nothing to deserve the horrors that overwhelmed him: the loss of his income, of his loved ones, of his own health.No book in the Bible speaks more bleakly, more honestly to the anxieties of 2020. Why have such sufferings been visited on humanity? What have people done to deserve them? How can there be meaning in a cosmos where they are permitted to happen? We are not the first generation to ask such questions in the face of a pandemic, of course.The inability of our treatments and vaccines to combat Covid-19, makes vivid for us a sense of the impotence before disease that our ancestors long had no choice but to take for granted. Just as medicine redeemed us from such dread before, so surely it will again – and yet dread will remain. A universe that can unleash Covid-19 against us can reasonably be expected to unleash much worse as well. Why, then, in the wake of a pestilence such as we are currently experiencing, should dread not mutate into despair? “Curse God,” Job’s wife advises him, “and die.”But Job does not curse God. He wins through to an acceptance that there is indeed justice and purpose in the universe.His story became one of many that, assembled together into the corpus of Christian scripture, provided the basis for what one Jewish scholar has termed “the most powerful of hegemonic cultural systems in the history of the world”. Christianity claimed something remarkable, novel, bizarre: that the Creator of the cosmos, taking on mortal form, had suffered as the most abject of his creations suffered. He had become, in that sense, like Job. From this, so Christians came to believe, it followed that there was no human existence so wretched, none so tortured or vulnerable, that it did not bear witness to the image of God. Divine love for the wretched demanded that mortals love them too.In the Roman Empire, hospitals had existed solely to prevent slaves and soldiers from malingering. In Christendom they served as practical manifestations of a far more compassionate conviction: that the attention of doctors and nurses should not just be a perk of the rich. The National Health Service has its roots sunk deep into Christian soil. No coincidence that the Prime Minister, when he fell dangerously ill, should have been rushed to a hospital named after one of Christ’s disciples.Nevertheless, there is a paradox. Over the course of the millennia, the Church’s teachings on the obligation of the rich and healthy to care for the poor and sick have proven so successful that they no longer depend on the Church itself. Its ancient sense of mission – to care for the vulnerable and the weak – has been largely subsumed within the welfare state. The sense of calling felt by Christians to care for the victims of pandemics, one that reaches back to the terrible plagues that swept the Roman world in the first and second centuries, has been nationalised. The NHS is now the object of our reverence.Yet this does not mean the Church is wholly redundant. The welfare state can provide care for the sick, but it cannot provide what Christianity, over the course of the past 2,000 years, has provided to so many countless people, and to such transformational effect: an explanation for the existence of suffering that offers the assurance as well that all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well. Such a message, in a time of “noisome pestilence,” has historically proved a comforting one – and therefore, by rights, the sweep of coronavirus should present Christian leaders with an opportunity.Yet it is one that all the mainstream churches in this country seem to be fumbling. Rather than speaking with the voice of prophecy, rather than explaining to a grieving and anxious people how the dead will rise into the blaze of eternal life, rather than proclaiming the miracles and mysteries that they uniquely exist to proclaim, church leaders seem to have opted instead to talk like middle managers.Parroting the slogans of the Department of Health and Social Care may conceivably help save lives – but it seems unlikely to win many souls. If ever there were a time for the churches to wrestle with the questions that so tormented Job, a time of global pandemic would surely seem to be it. If they are not to seem merely eccentric branch offices of the welfare state, they need to recapture their confidence, and take a risk: the risk of seeming odd.   Church of EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Residents in Moscow - the epicentre of the contagion - are being urged to stay home despite glorious weather.Russia’s biggest city with a budget rivaling that of Paris or Berlin, Moscow has managed the outbreak with lockdown restrictions, widespread testing, and millions of pounds worth of new hospital beds and medical equipment.But the rest of the country, which lags far behind on living standards, is at risk of being overwhelmed. Doctors across Russia have clamoured for help in recent weeks, complaining about under-funded and under-equipped hospitals, which often lack basic necessities.In one of the most recent appeals, dozens of desperate health care workers in the city of Ufa, some 700 miles east of Moscow, recorded a video urging top officials to investigate what they described as a cover-up of the Covid-19 outbreak at a hospital there.Recent opinion polls show that Russians are ided almost exactly in half in their views on the efficiency of the state response.“That’s a pretty favourable result for the government,” Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman told The . “The most important thing for authorities right now is to make sure that society doesn’t rally around the shared discontent.But a lot will depend on how soon Russia will emerge from the lockdown and how quick the recovery will be,” said Denis Volkov, deputy director at the Levada pollster.A petition from opposition leader Alexei Navalny urging the Kremlin to extend emergency payouts to Russians and scrap all taxes for small businesses has already attracted more than half a million signatures.When coronavirus began to spread, Russia was about to hold a vote on constitutional amendments allowing President Putin to stay in power until at least 2036. Political commentators earlier this month mentioned the unthinkable: scrapping the vote for Putin’s amendments altogether.Although most still expect it to go ahead, the Kremlin will have a hard time convincing Russians - battered by what many expect to be the country’s worst economic crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union - to come out to vote.“People don’t care about this at all right now: what they worry about is their economic future,” said Ms Lipman.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/05/01/TELEMMGLPICT000230496617_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth","title":"government policy dictated guesswork","story":"When the Government sent us into lockdown seven weeks ago, we were told it had to be done or a quarter of a million people would dieWhen the Government sent us into lockdown seven weeks ago, we were told it had to be done or a quarter of a million people would die. The origin of this belief was the paper published by Professor Neil Ferguson and his Imperial College team on March 16, which claimed that a herd immunity strategy would kill 250,000 people. This immediately became “the science” and was treated rather as if the clouds had parted and ine truth had shone through.But it hadn’t. All that happened was that one group of scientists, working with fragments of observed data and making various assumptions, ran a mathematical model which produced a frighteningly high number. It was treated with a reverence it did not deserve because too few commentators and government ministers really understand the difference between observation and scientific modelling.When scientists count and measure things they can generally be trusted to work to objective principles. There is still room for disagreement – as Cambridge Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, David Spielgelhalter, wrote this week, defining what constitutes a death from Covid-19 is far from straightforward – but when you are presented with observed data it is not unreasonable in many cases to treat it as fact.But modelling should never be treated as such. When scientists build models they are creating their own little digital worlds, making huge assumptions along the way. What you get out is only as good as those assumptions – and they are often way off-beam. Modelling in epidemiology is really no different from economic modelling – and we know how often that has gone wrong, such as with the Treasury’s forecast that unemployment would rise by between 500,000 and 800,000 within two years of a referendum vote for Brexit. Actually it fell to the lowest level in 45 years.To take the infamous Imperial paper, it assumed that 30 per cent of people who are infected with the virus Sars-Cov-2 will show symptoms of Covid-19. Subsequent studies from Italy and China, using observed data, suggest that 50-80 per cent is more accurate. The Imperial paper also assumed that the infection mortality rate is 0.9 per cent. The Imperial team has already revised this down to 0.66 per cent, and some epidemiologists believe it is far lower still. Those two factors completely undermine the 250,000 figure.The usefulness of the Imperial team’s modelling became apparent at the end of March when another paper from the team predicted that with social distancing measures in place, Britain was now heading for just 5,700 deaths. The toll is now over 28,000. Yet still the Government seems to be beholden to Imperial’s predictions – the latest one being that 100,000 people could die if lockdown is lifted too soon.The original Imperial paper also suggested that almost a third of over‑80s would be admitted to hospital with coronavirus, 71 per cent of whom would need critical care. As this newspaper reports today, this projection resulted in Nightingale hospitals remaining empty, as models failed to take into account that ventilator use is rarely advised for elderly people.Epidemiology necessarily relies on some degree of modelling. It would be unethical as well as impractical to build two identical human communities, one subject to lockdown and one not, then to infect both with a pathogen and see what happens. So those communities get modelled instead. The trouble comes when scientists get carried away with the cleverness of their models and when non-scientifically minded ministers and civil servants think they are being presented with hard evidence.It is the same with that other great hot potato of the moment, climate science. We can’t build two parallel Earths, pump in different levels of carbon dioxide to their atmospheres and then observe what happens. Yet the figures we get from crude models are treated as if they were the results of carefully controlled experiments. We don’t really know how the climate will respond to higher levels of carbon dioxide, any more than we know how many people will contract Covid-19 next week.Over the next few months scientists will be undertaking controlled trials of potential vaccines for Covid-19. They will be meticulously observing what happens when real, human volunteers are administered either a shot of the vaccine or of a placebo. The contrast between this rigorous science and the guesswork which has governed policy on coronavirus to date could not be greater.Pandemics and epidemicsThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The following Monday, all places of education would open. Then on the first of each month a new set of things would open first non-essential shops, then bars and restaurants, then gyms and hairdressers.It would give the months a magical feeling as the country came alive again in the summertime. And it would be slow, so we could monitor what happens. By then it would be September, and we could either carry on opening up if infection falls, or go back into hibernation in autumnwinter if it was rising. But we’d have had some kind of a summer to get us through till spring 2021.”I was remarkably pleased with the visionary quality of my post and like a pig in muck with the copious quantities of “likes” that subsequently came my way. But a week is a long time in quarantine and I’m writing this on a wet and blustery May Day, so the kids wouldn’t exactly be living La Vida Loca anyway.Somewhat unsettlingly, an Ipso poll this week claimed that 60 per cent of people would be wary of returning to work, while a YouGov poll saw only 11 per cent of parents desirous of schools opening. As I get older I’ve been starting to see both sides of an argument, and as a hyper‑social lone wolf I’ve been quite laissez faire about lockdown. But on hearing the recommendations of this week’s Warwick University study that the over-50s, rather than just the over‑70s, should be kept in coronavirus lockdown for longer, it’s amazing how quickly I made up my mind, as I am 60 years old and still spry as an ibex.It’s worth noting that ethnic minorities and overweight people are also disproportionally affected imagine the ructions if some medical adviser suggested they stay at home indefinitely. Additionally, I’ve just heard on the radio that people going back to work are getting abuse from neighbours for “bringing back” the virus – which implies that the “community spirit” that was so lauded in the early weeks may be curdling into something more toxic.I’ve always believed the British to be a rebellious people, so I prefer to put a cheery spin on the Ipso poll: that we trust our Prime Minister more than most other nations do theirs. We’re so disillusioned with liars who present themselves as Good Guys (Blair, Brown) that we respond positively to a cad who seems capable of becoming a better person. (I always prefer vice-signallers to virtue-signallers – we’re more fun and generally, paradoxically, nicer.)As Mr Johnson has suffered the plague, he seems one of us in yet another way, notorious for being all too human. If he seems fearful of lifting lockdown, knowing what we do of his past recklessness, we really believe it would be unwise. I hope that our newfound agoraphobia is, more than anything, a vote of confidence in him. Amusingly, in a strange collision of bedfellows, those who most loathe Boris are massive lockdowners.I understand that self-isolation was desirable at a certain point, but so are many things which one doesn’t necessarily want to last forever. The idea of my fellow citizens becoming a mole-like species hiding from the brazen benediction of the sun and snitching on sunbathers repels me as much as the virus itself does.Politicians must now concentrate on hope – that shy but vital sister of faith and charity – because without it there is literally no reason to carry on. People without it aren’t just defeatist, they’re dangerous as they have nothing to lose – and no politician wants a defeatist and dangerous electorate.After six weeks of making us live in limbo, our rulers would be wise to consider that as they plan the forthcoming summer, haunted by the spectre of its own imminence. Our patience must be rewarded with hope.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

A growing body of international evidence suggests that children are less susceptible to infection of coronavirus, experience milder symptoms and are significantly less contagious than the general population.Researchers in the Netherlands and Iceland, using extensive contact tracing, have not yet found a single case of anyone under the age of 18 transmitting Covid-19 to their households. Danish schools have been open for weeks, with no major spike in cases. Swiss schools reopen next week. It is vital that we do not lag behind this all-important curve in our attempt to flatten the overall one.So far, teaching unions have opposed reopening, citing safety concerns that are wholly understandable amid an alarming virus about which we still know so little. But their risk-aversion carries risks of its own. Lockdown has already widened educational inequalities.Keeping secondary schools closed could create a two-tier system, between private schools – many of which have already been exploring reopening with social distancing measures – and the rest. Independent schools may worry about cash-strapped parents defaulting on fees, but they will benefit from a powerful competitive advantage if payment becomes the only way of educating your child.  Middle-class youngsters already have a head-start in the form of sharp-elbowed parents, resources and congenial working environments. Though few are finding it easy, the headache of home schooling becomes a logistical nightmare in crowded or chaotic homes. According to the Sutton Trust, less than half our young are working at home on a daily basis, a figure that slides further in disadvantaged areas.Though schools technically remain open for children considered “at risk”, as well as the children of key workers, just one in 10 of the vulnerable kids eligible to attend is doing so. Those who most need the guidance, pastoral care, and reassurance of a regular academic routine are overwhelmingly not getting it.This is not just a question of welfare or educational attainment, but of family finances. Depriving parents of childcare has climactic repercussions for the whole economy, but particularly so for poorer parents, whose jobs often cannot be performed remotely.My major frustration in this pandemic has been our apparent inability to contextualise risk. Though public attention has focused on heartbreaking cases of young victims, we forget that these are the overwhelming anomalies. We should of course strive to minimise risks, whether by allocating PPE or exempting older teachers. But you can never eliminate the risks entirely – and there is no guarantee of a vaccine any time soon.In the meantime, reopening schools, starting with the youngest pupils, remains one of the safest steps out of lockdown. Two cheers to the Government for recognising this now they must broaden it to secondary schools too. Our children deserve nothing less. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Last year, Joe Russo claimed that Captain America had the power to lift Thor’s hammer in Age of Ulton, but pretended he couldn’t to keep Thor happy.Regardless, Marvel fans are not happy with Markus’ revelation. In reply to his tweet, one person wrote: “Wow, that is very clearly not how Thor’s hammer works... Unless you’re trying to retcon everything these days.”Another person wrote: “Mjolnir is not a lie detector and in the comics if a character can budge it, they can lift it. There is NO in between.”One tweeter asked : “Do y’all just not understand Steve’s character?”Next on the Marvel agenda is Black Widow, which was scheduled to be released on 1 May but has been psuhed back to November because of the coronavirus pandemicThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Japan’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.8 per cent to 19,619.35 while the S\u0026ampPASX 200 in Australia gave up 4.2 per cent to 5,289.40.The future for the S\u0026ampP 500 lost 1.7 per cent while that for the Dow industrials gave up 1.5 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe S\u0026ampP 500 fell 0.9 per cent on Thursday after reports showed millions more US\u0026nbspworkers filed for unemployment benefits last week and the European economy crumpled to its worst performance on record last quarter, among other lowlights. It was the biggest loss for the US\u0026nbspstock market in more than a week, but just a wiggle within the S\u0026ampP 500’s 12.7 per cent gain for April, its best month in decades.“Maybe it was the whole month-end malaise, or maybe they just need to hear something new and impactful, and that we’re ultimately seeing buying fatigue,” Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a commentary.Wall Street suffers worst fall in three weeks amid falling oil pricesTrump defends virus response with newspaper op-ed and Cuomo videoThis is what Trump should’ve actually done to save the economyUS stock market falling faster than during the Wall Street CrashPromises from the Federal Reserve and other central banks to do whatever it takes to prop up the economy through the coronavirus crisis have supported buying by investors betting that a recovery will come soon. Professional investors say that optimism may be premature.“The rebound in April was an assumption that this was going to be a short, V-shaped recovery, both economically and at the corporate and business level,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J P\u0026nbspMorgan Private Bank.“In our view, it probably has gotten a little ahead of itself. We think it’s going to be a longer and slower recovery.”The month’s gains for stocks came in the face of mayhem in the oil market, where prices in one corner dipped below zero for the first time, and as investors continued to rush into US\u0026nbspgovernment bonds in search of safety. Reports piled up by the day showing the severe hits the economy is taking from widespread stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus.US\u0026nbspbenchmark crude picked up 46 cents to $19.30 (£15.44) per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Discouraging data also came in on China’s economy, which is concerning for anyone expecting a first-in-first-out economic wave.“This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following economic data, they wrote in a report. “The statistical offices of the economies we watch pumped out 19 economic reports overnight. They revealed historic declines of activity and surging unemployment on a scale we have never seen before. We are sad.”The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 0.61 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 0.63 per cent\u0026nbsplate on Thursday. It started the year close to 1.90 per cent. Treasury yields tend to fall when investors are downgrading their expectations for the economy and inflation.In currency trading, the dollar fetched 107.09 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0963 (£0.88) from $1.0955.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.In recent days, many of Mr Musk\u0027s posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted FREE AMERICA NOW and Give people their freedom back.He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as fascistic as part of a impassioned diatribe.Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.Created with Sketch.Armed protests against stay-at-home coronavirus measures in Michigan Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstrator shouts next to two masked security guards at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan during a protest against stay-at-home ordersArmed members of a milita group at the state Capitol building in Lansing, Michiga, during a protest against coronavirus lockdown measuresA protester at the state Capitol in Lansing holds a sign comparing Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer to Adolf Hitler during a demonstration against coronavirus lockdown measuresAn armed protester takes part in a demonstation against lockdown measures at the state Capitol in Lansing, MichiganA protester holds a sign saying \u0027Bill Gates is evil\u0027 at a demonstration against stay-at-home orders at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan.

But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk\u0027s official account.The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk\u0027s other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity\u0027s return to the moon\u0027s surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The ministers and the prime minister are saying they are following science advice, and that\u0027s what is determining the path into the future,” he said.“But if we\u0027re not given access to the science advice it\u0027s very difficult to evaluate that, and by given access I mean, when I was chief scientific adviser I explained to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that every bit of advice I put into them I would put into the public domain as well.“I recognised I was giving advice, but they were making the political decision, they would bring in strategy advisers and other advisers, but the advice was purely scientific.”Scottish health secretary announces more funding for mental health servicesA number of measures to support mental health during the coronavirus pandemic have been announced by Scotland’s health secretary.Jeane Freeman encouraged the public to take advantage of mental health services, telling Scottish people: “Help is there if you need it.”Ms Freeman said £105,000 was being provided to the organisation Young Scot to create “a range of digital content on mental wellbeing” and a total of £700,000 was being provided to The Spark, a charity which provides relationship counselling services.“The most important message I want to get across today is simply this - help is there if you need it,” she said.“The NHS Inform website can help you to find the services that are best for you and the website clearyourhead.scot has advice and tips on how to maintain your mental wellbeing.\u0026nbsp“So please reach out, help is there for you.”Today\u0027s Downing Street press briefing will be at 4pm (in 20 minutes) and will feature Michael Gove and Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England.Third of people test positive for Covid-19 in random tests in AfghanistanA third of people who were randomly tested in Afghanistan’s capital have been found to have coronavirus, Afghan health officials have said, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in the country.Wahid Mayar, the Public Health Ministry spokesperson, said the results of the random tests on 500 people in the capital of Kabul were “concerning”.Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far - close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections in a nation of 36.6 million people.As more testing becomes available, the country\u0027s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, Mr Mayar said.Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread.The death toll, which is officially at 85, could also be much higher.More than 250,000 Afghan people have returned home from Iran, the original epicentre of coronavirus in the Middle East, since the beginning of the year, travelling across their country without being tested or quarantined.McDonald’s trials social distancing measures in NetherlandsMcDonald’s in the Netherlands is trialing measures to maintain social distancing\u0026nbspin its restaurants when they are allowed to reopen, with designated waiting spots for customers and hand sanitisers being installed at entrances.“We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere,” McDonald\u0027s Netherlands spokesperson Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters.“These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don\u0027t notice them too much.”Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since 15 March but new infections have been dropping in the country in recent days, prompting calls for the lockdown to be loosened soon.A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around 12 May, but prime minister Mark Rutte has ruled out a return to normal business.Customers and staff will have to keep at least 1.5 metres apart to avoid a new wave of infections if restaurants are allowed to reopen.McDonald\u0027s says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders.Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line.Although many restaurant owners fear social distancing will put them out of business, McDonald’s expects its new set-up to work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the Netherlands.“On average this will allow us to serve around 66 per cent of our normal number of customers,” Ms Koekkoek said.“We don\u0027t expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order.”Number of Scottish patients in intensive care drops below 100 for first time since MarchThe Scottish health secretary had said the number of people in intensive care in the region has fallen below 100 for the first time since March, as the number of deaths in Scotland rose by 12 today.Jeane Freeman revealed the figures, which showed 99 patients in intensive care, at the Scottish government’s press briefing on Sunday“It\u0027s obviously very encouraging news,” Ms Freeman said of the intensive care numbers.“It does show that the restrictions are working, but it also underlines the reasons why we need to stick to them.“So I want to thank all of you for the sacrifices you have made and I know will continue to make. I know it is not easy, but I hope you are beginning to see - as we do - that those sacrifices are beginning to show results.”A total of 1,571 patients have now died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus and there are 1,666 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19.Work times could be staggered to avoid crowded commutes, transport secretary saysUK businesses could be asked to stagger working hours as part of plans to return to work after the coronavirus lockdown is eased, the transport secretary has said.Grant Shapps told the BBC on Sunday that the government was looking into how to prevent public transport becoming crowded on commutes.“There are a series of different things that we can do including staggering work times, working with businesses and organisations to do that,” Mr Shapps said, adding that he wanted to encourage a “massive expansion” of cycling or walking to work\u0026nbspto help keep numbers down.The minister also said he was working with train companies and unions on plans to maintain social distancing rules on platforms and at bus stops once the lockdown is lifted.‘Clear line’ linking austerity and lack of preparedness for Covid-19, expert saysThe “lack of preparedness” for the coronavirus pandemic in the UK was linked to austerity measures over the last decade, the chairman of a government-commissioned review into health inequalities has said.Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity, has blamed a lack of financial support for the health and social care systems during the 2010s for some of the problems the country is facing today.“We\u0027re terribly worried about the health of workers in social care. The reduction in adult social care spending over the last decade was 7 per cent in real terms,” Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend.“But in the most deprived 20 per cent of areas, the reduction was 16 per cent. In the least deprived 20 per cent, the reduction was 3 per cent.“So we\u0027re wringing our hands about how awful it is in social care - we just haven\u0027t been spending - in fact doing the opposite.”He added: “So there\u0027s a clear line between our lack of preparedness in the healthcare system, in the social care system and in community resources more generally - the decline of support for the voluntary sector - a clear line between austerity and our lack of preparedness to cope with this pandemic.”Sir Michael also noted that the pandemic was exposing “underlying health inequalities” and amplifying them, with the lockdown affecting people unequally.His comments come after analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that people living in the most deprived areas of England have experienced coronavirus mortality rates more than double those living in the least deprived areas.Thailand opens parks and restaurants under strict rules in capitalThailand has taken its first steps in easing its coronavirus restrictions by opening parks and restaurants, under strict conditions, in the country’s capital of Bangkok.Restaurants have been able to reopen in the city, which is famous for its eateries, but only under guidelines which may make it hard for them to turn a profit, with customers being kept at least 1.5 metres apart.Sanitary measures have also been introduced, such as taking the temperature of customers and staff and circulating fresh air into buildings.Elsewhere, barbers and hairdressers around the city have been allowed to reopen, under strict social distancing rules, and many appeared to be doing good business on Sunday.There has also been a partial lifting of restrictions on the sale of alcoholic drinks, allowing takeaway purchases, after a nationwide ban on such drinks took effect on 10 April.Thai health authorities reported three new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the country’s total to 2,969, including 54 deaths.\u0026nbspThere have been only single-digit increases in new cases for more than a week, leading to optimism that the country has the rate of transmission under control.Russian authorities to use helicopters and drones to police lockdownRussia\u0027s National Guard will deploy helicopters and drones in Moscow to monitor compliance with lockdown measures during holidays this week.Much like in many European countries, Russian officials have been concerned that warm spring weather and a string of holidays could tempt people to leave their homes and gather in woodland parks.Monday and Tuesday are legal holidays in Russia, while Saturday marks the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany - a day which is usually celebrated with large outdoor gatherings.Dutch confirmed cases rise by 335, deaths up by 69The number of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 335 to 40,471,\u0026nbsphealth officials in the country have said.However, Dutch authorities have warned the tally of confirmed cases is unlikely to show the actual number of infections as not all suspected Covid-19 patients have been tested.The National Institute for Public Health also reported 69 new deaths on Sunday, bringing the Netherlands’ total fatalities to 5,056.Vietnam reports first new coronavirus infection in nine daysVietnam reported its first new coronavirus infection in nine days on Sunday, a British oil expert who was quarantined on arrival, the health ministry said.The Southeast Asian country has registered a total of 271 coronavirus cases and has reported no deaths, the ministry said in a statement.More than\u0026nbsp30,500 people have been quarantined, and 261,000 tests have been carried out.Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Altogether, the contracts for the initial 10-month period total 967 million US dollars.This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon by 2024, Mr Bridenstine said.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesHe noted it will be the first lunar lander since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972.Over the next 10 months, each company will refine its concept and Nasa will decide which lander to test first.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will go with the company that has the highest probability of success by 2024.Nasa will rely on its own Orion capsules and Space Launch System megarockets - still under development - to launch astronauts to the moon.The two other companies, Boeing and Vivace, put in bids but were eliminated early on, leaving the three awarded contracts.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The Dynetics lander is so low to the ground that only a few steps are needed, like a front porch, a feature that Nasa gave high marks for safety and efficiency.SpaceX is using its own Starship spacecraft - still under development in Texas - and its own rockets. Blue Origin and Dynetics are partnering with numerous subcontractors, including commercial launch companies.Going commercial, Mr Bridenstine said, will drive down costs while increasing access.It builds off of Nasa\u0027s commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.Just last November, SpaceX and Blue Origin were among the companies that won contracts to make cargo deliveries to the moon.Nasa wants the new Artemis moon-landing programme to be sustainable, unlike Apollo, with multiple missions and multiple locations on the lunar surface.While only one company will carry the first woman and next man to the lunar surface, all three will participate over the long haul, officials noted.By learning how to live and work on another world - the moon - Nasa will be better equipped to eventually send astronauts to Mars, Mr Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe letter, which was also signed by campaign groups including Hope not Hate and the Community Security Trust, was addressed to the heads of Facebook, YouTube, where Icke has 899,000 subscribers, Twitter, where Icke’s account has 288,000 followers, and Amazon.“There is a moral duty on each of you to act,” it said. “Please remove David Icke from your platforms.”It was published on Friday morning, as Facebook appears to have removed Icke’s main account, which had almost 800,000 “likes”.Almost half of Britons believe coronavirus is ‘man-made’, poll finds5G conspiracy theory most common fake news story about coronavirusMuslims targeted with ‘dangerous’ conspiracy theories during lockdownBut the “David Icke – Headlines” page, with a smaller following of 68,000, and London Real, an account with 586,000 followers that regularly publishes interviews with Icke, remained online.A post on Icke’s website called Facebook “fascist”, and included a message from Facebook reading: “Your page has been unpublished for going against the Facebook Community Standards on health misinformation that could cause physical harm.”Polling previously commissioned by Hope Not Hate found that 51 per cent of British people had heard of Icke, and one in eight had read or watched his claims in the past six months.Broadcaster London Live was sanctioned by Ofcom for interviewing Icke and YouTube and Facebook removed the footage.But the CCDH report said the “piecemeal” response allowed Icke to launch a fresh drive for new followers using the publicity, leading to a huge expansion of his audience.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: “While people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms.“Misinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance.“It’s time to stop giving valuable airtime on their platform to the most dangerous voices and instead join with the rest of us in trying to contain this lethal pandemic. The reckless endangerment of public safety by greedy social media firms must stop.”A spokesperson for Twitter said it was removing coronavirus-related content “when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm”.“We will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19,” a statement added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The performance has a full production team working behind the scenes and is directed by the award-winner Sam Yates.Money raised from ticket sales will be given to The Felix Project, The Independent’s campaign partner, and to support out-of-work professionals in the theatre industry including a costume designer and a stage manager.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Tom’s play, a comedy set in a private nursing home, follows a seemingly healthy man who attempts to shut himself off from the world. It is the first of the Remote Reads produced by artistic non-profit organisations Platform Presents and Apples and Oranges Arts.Morrissey said: “I’m very excited to be taking part in this live reading. It’s a beautifully written piece by Tom Stoppard and I’m looking forward to performing it.”How to support our campaignThe former Walking Dead villain, who has been volunteering for The Felix Project for about 18 months, praised the charity for “working tirelessly at this very challenging time”.A depot coordinator for The Felix Project commended Morrissey for being “a brilliant ambassador” for the charity.“From his first shift, he was grabbing crates, ing in, just going above and beyond.”\u0026nbspThe Independent launched the Help The Hungry campaign to support the work of The Felix Project in redistributing food to frontline charities, vulnerable iniduals and NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.Sir Tom said: “It’s a delightful surprise to find that a play that I haven’t really thought about for over half a century is getting a new production, especially with such a stunning cast. It’s about the last thing I expected and I’m quite excited about it.“The play was actually written as one half of a 60-minute slot, the other half of which was a documentary about chess players. The idea was that the film and the play would somehow complement each other. The idea was that the man in the play and the chess players were finding some kind of sanctuary in a closed world.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You told them them they were clinically vulnerable, regardless of medical condition.Another said the comments were blatantly not true and pointed to screenshots from the government\u0027s website.The confusion appears to have been partly fuelled by the fact the government has two separate but similarly named categories, each asked to follow different requirements: clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Suddenly you get a confusion.There must be a single voice taking the view of the scientific community to the prime minister, that is the most important thing.Sir David revealed his plans for a shadow committee in the Sunday Times, adding: I am not at all critical of the scientists who are putting advice before the Government ... but because there is no transparency the Government can say they are following scientific advice but we don\u0027t know that they are.Criticising Mr Cummings\u0027 attendance at the meetings, he said: Cummings is an adviser to the prime minister and the chief scientific adviser is an adviser to the prime minister.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

bid to achieve 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of April, with official figures released at Downing Street showing 122,347 tests in the UK on Thursday.But there were accusations that the government had moved the goalposts to achieve the ambitious deadline, by including more than 27,000 home-testing kits at the point they were sent out to members of the public rather than waiting until\u0026nbspthe test has\u0026nbspbeen completed.Thursday’s figure - on the final day of the deadline - represented a leap of more than 18,000 from the previous day’s tally of 81,611.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt brought the total number of antigen tests - which show whether an inidual currently has the illness - over the course of the outbreak to more than a million, though the UK\u0027s\u0026nbsp1,023,824 remains well behind\u0026nbspGermany, where 50,000 were being tested a day as early as\u0026nbspthe start of April.Mr Hancock also announced that he aims to have an army of 18,000 contact tracers in place by mid-May to track down contacts of those shown by tests to be positive for Covid-19.Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock revealed that the total UK\u0026nbspdeath toll has risen to 27,510 over the course of the outbreak, with 739 fatalities in all settings on Thursday.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers

total, which was at about 10,000 when Mr Hancock set his target at the start of April and was hovering around 20,000 little more than a week ago, was rapidly increased over the past few days with the

sent to satellite sites within the health service, which were counted on dispatch rather than after they have been returned to labs and analysed.Mr Hancock heralded the expansion in testing as an “incredible achievement”.He said: “I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal, because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.”He praised his team for working “tirelessly… with grit and determination” to reach the goal.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used -\u0026nbspor indeed, might never be used - as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency - the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.“In any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.”Mr Hancock said that the testing capacity now available was “crucial to suppress the virus” and would “help us to unlock the lockdown”.It would be backed up by an initial 18,000 contact-tracers to be in place by the middle of May, with more to be recruited if required.“The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections,” he said.Speaking a day after prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “roadmap” out of lockdown, Mr Hancock said: “In recent weeks we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom.“Freedom from the virus, yes - and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so - but also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too – each citizen’s right to do as they please.“For now, we’re working together to stay home, we’re impinging on the freedom of all for the safety of all.“With this next mission of test, track and trace, I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision and so to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.”Prof Newton rejected suggestions that the UK’s slow adoption of mass testing had “kept us in lockdown a day longer”.Stay-at-home measures were introduced in March not because of a lack of tests but because of the wide circulation of the Covid-19 virus in the population, he said.“Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase and at that point access to limitless testing even if we had had it would’ve made no difference,” he said.“The decision to enter into lockdown would have been the same and would’ve been taken at the same time.“In the same way the route out of lockdown has not been blocked by low levels of testing. We can relax social distancing only when the Government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down.“Testing will help to keep it out of control once we’re out of lockdown but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown a day longer.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Trials need to show the vaccine is safe.WHAT’S the UK doing A potential vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford has begun its human trials — the first in Europe.HOW will it be produced The Oxford study has linked up with UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to mass produce the potential vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.WHEN will one be available Most experts reckon by mid- but the Oxford team are saying they will knowtheirs works by this summer.IS there a drug to treat the coronavirus Early results of a US trial suggest antiviral drug remdesivir cuts the number of days patients take to leave hospital by almost a third.HOW does it work Remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, targets a cell enzyme the virus needs.IS it a game changer Potentially. Dr Anthony Fauci, leading member of the US coronavirus task force, said: “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” But a second trial in China showed no benefit.WHO is looking for a drug cure There are around  clinic trials going on worldwideOxford isnt the only British university attacking coronavirus.Hancock also announced a boost of £.million to Imperial College London for its vaccine research.There are reportedly around  groups across the globe working to find a vaccine, as there remains no preventative measure for Covid- at the moment and no real treatment either.Imperial College London and University Hospital Southampton have offered up to £ as they advertised for people to take part in trials.On April , Britains Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the Government has set up a vaccine task force to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine - one that is hoped to be made available as soon as possible.The task force will be facilitating trials, working in the UK and internationally.He confirmed that the Government has green-lighted  research projects - with £m going towards them.Sharma said that we cannot put a date on when we will make a vaccine, but hopes that through the best of British scientic endeavour, it will be available soon.The first human volunteers were injected with an experimental jab in Seattle in mid-March.Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said further human trials could begin in coming months with testing on mice currently looking promising.He told Independent: Currently we have a prototype vaccine in animal models where the early results are encouraging.We are hoping to progress to clinical testing by the summer depending on obtaining sufficient funds for the next stage.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well, but it will need support from government agencies.The London-listed company says it will begin clinical trials on humans after running pre-clinical tests.The treatment is being developed by the companys bio-health ision, Kentucky BioProcessing .KBP previously came up with a drug to combat Ebola.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight Covid-, using genetically modied tobacco plants, but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc is testing an experimental Ebola antiviral therapy, remdesivir, on patients with coronavirus in China and Japan - with positive signs so far.In Wuhan where the virus outbreak began, Chinas Changjiang Daily reported that researchers at Zhejiang University have found that drugs Abidol and Darunavir can inhibit the virus in vitro cell experiments.And scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a major step toward creating a vaccine.Meanwhile, over in Germany, CureVac are also working on a vaccine, with majority investor and owner of football club Hoffenheim - Dietmar Hopp - revealing that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come.Hopp, having already gained headlines for protests in football stadiums, revealed that the vaccine will not be privatised after German reports claimed US President Donald Trump was looking to secure some of the scientists working on the project.A vaccine normally takes years, or even a decade, but this wont be the case with coronavirus.Researchers, like Dr Kate Broderick, and Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predict that the fully formed and licensed vaccine will be available from early summer but it will still take at least one year evenexpedited.”The news comes as the global research community steps up its efforts to halt the fatal epidemic.Teams around the world are working on their own vaccines, a process that typically takes at least a decade.British-America Tobaccos scientic research director Dr David O’Reilly said vaccine development was challenging and complex work, but he believes the company has made a signicant breakthrough with its tobacco plant technology .Researchers in Australia revealed they had successfully synthesised the virus in the laboratory, using a sample from an infected patient.The sequencing and publication by Chinese scientists of the viral genome in only a few days, compared to the five months it took during the  Sars outbreak, is considered to be a game-changer.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus.It has similar symptoms to the common cold, making it tricky to identy early.The NHS states the key symptoms are:Doctors may order laboratory tests on respiratory specimens and serum, part of your blood, to detect human coronaviruses.The testing is more likelyyou are suspected of having Mers .A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.The UK Government has bought . million antibody home testing kits to ensure more people are tested quickly and simply without having to leave home.On March , , the Government announced the tests would soon be available to the masses, including NHS workers.The Health Secretary pledged to test , Brits a day for coronavirus - but the nation appears to be falling behind this target.Patients in hospital are quarantined and treated for their symptoms to try and help their bodies fight off the virus and prevent it spreading.In cases exhibiting pneumonia, around  per cent, patients are given oxygen and sometimes a ventilator.If their lungs become too inflamed then doctors work to relieve the pressure on other organs.In less severe cases patients are given a drip for dehydration or ibuprofen for pain relief while the body fights the infection.These treatments are reportedly effective for the most part.There are currently unveried theories that HIV medication could work too as it allegedly did with the  Sars virus, but it is only suggested for last-ditch compassionate use for extreme cases of coronavirus.Other than treatment, detection, sanitation and quarantine measures are being used to restrict the spread of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 6 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After days of hysterical commentary about increased car usage, the official slides at the Government briefing this week showed it had actually gone down.Is it any wonder that trust in telly journalists, with their constant gotcha questions of ministers and desire to do down our national effort, is plummeting So let me say this in Britain’s biggest newspaper that has maintained the loyalty of our brilliant army of readers with hysteria-free coverage: We have done so well and all deserve to be applauded for our stoic efforts to flatten the curve.Even at the start of March, nobody could have imagined that the UK would spend six weeks without the Premier League, McDonald’s or nightclubs Let alone losing those joys of our national le at a time when everyone other than key workers had to stay at home.You’ve missed weddings, births, signicant birthdays, important operations and even funerals. That’s why I am so proud of the citizens of this country.Do not let anyone tell you that the UK didn’t take this evil disease seriously. We did. Unquestionably.But that doesn’t mean we should now stay silent and accept a continued loss of our freedom and liberties. Our first goal is achieved: We avoided the NHS being overrun.Demanding answers from our leaders about what’s next and how we reopen our country does not for a single second make you disloyal — it makes you even more of a patriot.THE Greatest Dancer has been axed by the BBC.Which is bad news for star judge Cheryl Tweedy, who doesn’t seem to enjoy the same bankability she did at the height of her X Factor glory days .But good news for Girls Aloud fans like me as every solo flop just makes the reunion even more inevitable.lIn other exciting girl band news, the Spice Girls are in talks to do another world reunion tour.SADIQ KHAN has done so alarm-ingly little to help Londoners during this crisis – no masks, no sanitisers or PPE on public transport – that it might be time for the London Mayor to consider changing his name to Sadiq Can’t.MY love letter to the things I never thought I’d miss living in London . . .ONCE upon a time there lived a celebrity journalist called Omid Scobie.He revelled in the sort of nonsense that used to fill the pages of Star Magazine, one of the UK’s most downmarket celeb titles.For many years, until very recently, Mr Scobie also flogged story after story to popular newspapers about celebs and the royals, including the Mail on Sunday.Nothing wrong with that so far. But I’m just surprised that it’s this fellow hack who notoriously tabloid-hating Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has picked to write her hagiography, I mean, biography of her “horror” couple of years living inside the Royal Family.But I guess it makes sense in one way – Scobie is used to getting the best from dull PR spin. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-ANNA-WINTOUR.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-PANORAMA.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-LIAM-GALLAGHER.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky.

They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.Blaming the Wuhan meat market - where bats are not sold - was reportedly an effort to deflect blame from the communist government when the labs containment efforts failed.US officials warned two years ago that safety lapses during the study of bats could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.Secret cables from American embassy officials were obtained following their  visits to the Wuhan lab now at the centre of a global focus.The missives revealed fears of inadequate safety precautions by those conducting the bat studies could result in a deadly new strain of coronavirus.One US official said: “The cable was a warning shot. They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”The cables reveal that the US Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.In , the lab had become China’s first to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.But the cables argued that the US should give the Wuhan lab further support – because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but dangerous.In  the institute published research showing that horseshoe bats they collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same population that spawned the  SARS virus.The Chinese government has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins.Beijing has yet to provide samples of the coronavirus collected from the earliest cases.Officials at the Wuhan lab have dismissed allegations coronavirus came from their facility, branding them ‘baseless conspiracy theories’.But genetic evidence indicates the virus was not articially engineered and likely originated in bats.The genetic data cannot yet indicate exactly where and how the virus first crossed to humans.China President Xi Jinping warned the public about the virus on January  - when more than , people had been infected during almost a week of public silence.During the six days the world was unaware of the virus, the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the global outbreak - hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people, and millions began to travel through for Lunar New Year celebrations.On March , the virus was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.Other reports have also emerged alleging China attempted to cover up its role in the extent of the pandemic by silencing whistleblowers and muzzling scientists, while concerned doctors have ominously disappeared.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must also shine a light on the lives of children in poverty. Child poverty has already risen to . million under the Conservatives. In , the IFS predicted that the figure would increase to over  million by  , a direct result of government policies including the four year freeze on working age benefits and the two-child limit - and the coronavirus pandemic threatens to see it rise even higher. Right now pressure on family budgets, especially for those in low-paid, insecure employment, are being compounded as parents lose their jobs, are furloughed or see their working hours reduced. There is real concern that children will go hungry during the pandemic, in part because of logistical problems with the rollout of the national voucher scheme that is supposed to enable children eligible for free school meals to continue to access meals while they are out of school. The government must resolve these issues and ensure that funding levels for the scheme are sufficient to provide healthy, nutritious meals for children. Sadly, many parents will be forced to go without in order to feed their children. A YouGov poll commissioned earlier this month by the Food Foundation and the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission found that . million people had gone a whole day without eating since the lockdown came into effect, and that . million people say someone in their household has had to reduce or skip meals because they could not access or afford sufficient food. Parents going without is, of course, not a solution to the problem. The government must take action to address poverty now. Labour is calling for five urgent social security measures to provide immediate support to people affected by the coronavirus crisis: all Universal Credit advances to be converted to cash grants, the abolition of the two-child limit in Universal Credit and Tax Credits, suspension of the benefit cap, removal of the savings thresholds in Universal Credit, and an increase in Jobseeker’s Allowance and Employment Support Allowance to match the increase in Universal Credit.  Teachers across the country are working hard to ensure that the nine million children who are staying at home can continue to learn. However, this will be easier for some children than others. Children living in cramped housing will find it harder to learn than their more affluent classmates children who are hungry will undoubtedly struggle and those without Internet access and a laptop, tablet or PC will again be disadvantaged. The IPPR has pointed out that ‘an estimated  million children and their families do not have adequate access to a device or connectivity at home’. While the government has recently announced a scheme to provide digital devices and G dongles, to help some disadvantaged Year  pupils, care leavers and school children with social workers who do not already have such devices and who do not have access to the Internet, this has already met with delays and we still need clarity as to which children will benefit.Read more about our  Give Me Five campaign Poverty can have a devastating impact on children’s lives and on their futures. According to The Children’s Society, children growing up in poverty are more likely to experience mental health problems, under-achieve in school, feel unsafe and be subjected to bullying. They are also more likely to feel like a failure. It is vital that the government takes action on poverty. We live in one of the richest countries in the world: we cannot have a society in which children are so damaged and disadvantaged.

Boris Johnson today confirmed he is looking at relaxing strict laws which govern how long shops can open for on the weekend.The Prime Minister said things could be done dferently and better, adding: Why not start being flexible  No details of any review, including when and how any changes could happen, have been confirmed. However, a senior bishop has signalled the Church of England could swing behind a temporary relaxation of the rules. Large shops such as supermarkets are banned from opening for longer than six hours on Sundays between am and pm. Longer hours have long been opposed by Tory MPs and religious groups - who say Sunday must be special for low-wage staff and small shops trying to compete.But the coronavirus crisis has led to an unprecedented demand at supermarkets, with long queues outside as fewer people are allowed in due to social distancing.Now there are signs the Church of England could accept a temporary relaxing of Sunday trading laws to boost the economy. Dr Alan Smith, The Bishop of St Albans, said the pandemic meant we must all think about innovative and flexible ways to protect our local economies. Dr Smith, who speaks on behalf of the Church in the House of Lords, told the Sunday : We have always wanted to protect workersapos mental well-being and it is clear having a day off in common with the rest of our communities is key to those protections. The opportunity for a day of rest for all workers to spend time with loved ones is a basic right. So, while the novel coronavirus means we must all think about innovative and flexible ways to protect our local economies, it must not be at the expense of workers.

But now that we are past the peak, the government faces pressure to explain how, and when, it will ease up the rules. So over the next week, Boris Johnson is expected to lay out a roadmap for what will happen when the UK does relax the lockdown.He will change very little immediately - and wonapost end the lockdown in one go. But his plan will give us a clearer picture of what the UK will look like over the coming months in a new, coronavirus-scarred world. So what will reopen, what will stay shut - and how will your everyday le change  Weaposve had a look at the main proposals below.The aposroadmapapos explained The important thing to know is just because weaposre getting a aposroadmapapos this week, it doesnapost mean lockdown will end this week. The legal date to review the lockdown is Thursday  May, and Boris Johnson is expected to extend it for another three weeks, possibly with a few minor changes. But the PM will also - separately - announce a roadmap for easing the UK out of lockdown. This is expected later in the week, possibly only on Sunday  May. His plan will make clear that the UK is not ing to business as usual. Some restrictions will be eased, but others - like fines for breaches - will be made harsher than they are now. While people are put back on public transport and in some workplaces, there will be strict social distancing to keep people two metres apart. People are likely to be advised to cover their faces, and will be told to use an NHS phone app that alerts youyouaposve come into close contact with the virus.  When will it all happen  Thereaposs lots of speculation, but no firm date on when lockdown will start to be relaxed. As for when the current rules end completely, that may only be in . What we do know is the roadmap will begin once the aposRapos number - the average number of people infected by each Covid- carrier - is low enough. Currently R is . to . because so many people are out of contact with each other. Every time you relax a lockdown rule, R rises again. Ministers say they wonapost do anything that pushes the R number back above . The UK must also pass five tests before easing lockdown: The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPENo risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHS   Arriving in the UK Ministers are actively looking at quarantining people who arrive into the UK once lockdown begins to ease. Nothing is confirmed, but reports have suggested people will be asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. If so, this would be a major blow to the airline industry and render most holidays to Britain pointless. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: I think it’s important... that we ensure the sacrices in the sense of social distancing that we’re asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. So I am actively looking at these issues right now. So that when we have infection rates within the country under control, weaposre not importing.Schools Schools will reopen in a phased way, the government has confirmed - with some pupils going back first while others are told to remain at home. Ministers are looking at the idea of sending dferent year groups back at dferent times. Boris Johnson has signalled he wants primary schools to be the first to , while Walesapos First Minister has suggested Year  could be the very first year group back. Years  and  would then be the first back in secondary schools, according to one plan seen by the Sunday .  Priority could also be put on pupils with special educational needs. The Prime Minister must give schools notice in the next weekhe wants pupils tofrom June  - the first date head teachers have said could be acceptable. Schools say they will need time to put social distancing measures in place to ensure pupils are kept apart. Sources stress there is no final date and June may be put backthe virus is still too widespread. Universities The Sunday Times said at universities, arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus.  Public transport Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the number of trains will slowly rise as lockdown eases, to avoid overcrowding. Hand sanitiser and one-way systems would be placed on the network, with spacing at s and bus stops “clearly marked out” to keep people two metres apart. New timetables will be introduced as planned in May, even though trains will not run to them straight away. Firms would be urged to stagger workersapos start times to spread out the rush out. Meanwhile the government has hinted at more support for Cycle to Work, a tax break scheme where you can buy a bicycle over a year through your employer.  Workplaces and working from home Workplaces would have floor markings to ensure people are two metres apart, according leaked draft guidance. The guidance could also recommend staggered arrival times and breaks, fewer people in lts and regular deep cleaning, according to Sky News and the Sunday Express. However, it seems likely that not all workers would go back to the officethey donapost need to. Government advisors have previously said working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine for coronavirus.Supermarkets Supermarkets would doubtless keep many of the social distancing measures theyaposve already put in place. And opening hours could be increased on Sunday to reduce overcrowding. Boris Johnson has said heaposs looking at relaxing Sunday trading laws to reduce queues on the weekend.  Picnics and going outdoors People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, drive to the countryside and have picnics, according to the Mail on Sunday. Youaposd still have to be with members of your own household only, and keep two metres away from other groups.  No did not comment on the Mailaposs report. But ministers and scientists have repeatedly said outdoor gatherings look to be less risky than those indoors.  Building sites Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers. So the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said because the transmission rate of the virus outdoors is lower than indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs outside. He added: “Thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.”  aposBubblesapos of up to  peoplePeople could meet small bubbles of their friends and family under one idea to ease the coronavirus lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions on peopleaposs movement in the future. But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. Reports later said the idea was one being mulled by the UK government. But itaposs not set in stone.  Fines for breaching lockdown The government is considering raising the penalty for defying lockdown from £ to £ for a first offence. The fines would then double for each offence after that, just as they do already. And the maximum fine would rise from just under £, at the moment to £,. A senior government source did not deny these figures, reported by the Sunday , were under consideration. Covering your face The government hasnapost made a final decision on whether to ask people to cover their face in public. However, some kind of face covering advice is widely expected after Boris Johnson covering oneaposs face in some situations would be a useful tool. Itaposs understood thatface coverings are required, they wonapost be masks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended.And the government would provide guidance on what kind of material you can make such a covering from.Itaposs important that people donapost end up fiddling with their face covering in a way that means theyaposre actually creating more risk, by continually touching their face. Using a new app A new contact tracing app is expected to launch in around mid-May after trials on the Isle of Wight this week.The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus.It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselvesnecessary. It is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed. The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation. For it to work properly, at least % or so of the population need to download it. It will be paired with an army of , human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.  Pubs, grassroots sport, mass gatherings and other venues Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. Likewise, ministers have indicated that mass gatherings will be among the last things to reopen. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.”And Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the No coronavirus update: “Transmission is signicantly less outdoors than indoors.”Meanwhile hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. A aposone UKapos approach Scotland and Wales have repeatedly set out plans ahead of, or slightly dferently to, the rest of the UK government. And itaposs true that the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over areas like schools and care homes. However, ministers have also stressed they want to keep the whole of the UK moving in the same way at the same time. And the government has distanced itself from claims that worst-hit regions, like London and the West Midlands, could have dferent rules to the countryside. NHS services Some routine operations and fertility treatment have already been restored as hospital inpatients fall for several weeks in a row. However, itaposs not yet clear when other services - including ENT therapies and dentistry, where staff are particularly at risk of transmission - will continue.

The Prime Minister will unveil the governmentaposs roadmap out of the coronavirus lockdown over the next week.It is not expected to set out firm dates, but part of that plan is the phased reopening of schools - where ministers confirm some pupils will be sent back first, with others kept at home for longer. Now Mr Johnson appears to have confirmed primary pupils could be the first to . The risk from Covid- is thought to be the lowest in the youngest children. The PM told the Sun on Sunday he wants primary schools reopened as fast as we can adding: Thataposs where we want to go. Itaposs about working out a way to do it. Head teachers have previously said the earliest schools could reopen would be June, but only with proper notice. Reports now suggest the PM intends to put primary schools on notice as soon as this week - as long as infection rates continue to fall.  Under the plan, primary schools would be the first to accept students back. Wales is considering sending Year  pupils back first, followed by younger children. Year  and Year  pupils would then be the first toto secondary schools at a later date, according to the Sunday . These older pupils would only be allowed to the move did not increase transmissions to the point of causing a second outbreak. The newspaper said Whitehall sources have pencilled in a date of June , though this would be put backit was not yet safe to send pupils back to class. A senior government source told he Mirror no decisions had been taken and no date had been set. They did not rule out afrom June , but said: Full reopening will be done in close consultation with teachers and sector and lots of notice given.Wales’ First Minister Mark Drakeford today confirmed he is “talking about the beginning of June” as the first possible date for schools to reopen. He said advice from unions and councils is that three weeks’ notice would be needed “as a minimum” to reopen classrooms. So “we are talking about the beginning of June there,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. He said it “could be” at children with special educational needs or in Year  - who have the “rite of passage” of ending school - couldearlier than younger primary pupils. But while the Welsh government is responsible for Welsh schools, he stressed his “strong preference” is to follow the same plan for the whole of the UK. “I want to do it on a UK basis and I still think that’s something we can achieve,” he said. “You certainly can’t have schools reopen as they did before and sustain social distancing”, he added.  Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said ing to school “as soon as possible” is in children’s interests and “there’s a great deal of logic in targeting younger children”. She told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The younger the child, the more they need that simple structured routine where they understand what’s happening.” Ms Spielman said there will be a “widening and widening gap” between dferent children’s education the longer they stay out of school. She indicated children might be asked to come in on alternate days, for example, but stressed that many plans are being looked at. Asked about the idea she said: “I think a lot of ideas about rotation are being discussed, as we can see from other countries there doesn’t seem to be one obvious no-brainer answer.”  The Government is keen to get children back in the classroom as soon as possible to reduce the damage to aposearly years developmentapos and enable parents toto work. Secondary school pupils can do more work at home and online so are not considered aposas pressingapos, the paper reports. Class sizes might be limited temporarily to enable a safe . Today, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: Home learning is not easy, particularly when one or both parents are trying to work from home as well.” The Sunday Times said at universities, arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus. The Mirror understands the government will only announce tweaks to the lockdown this week, rather than lting it wholesale. Ministers could be encouraging building sites to reopen, relaxing rules on outdoor activities and urging people to cover their faces on public transport.

What they didn’t know is that they’d both strike a chord with each other’s partners. Both couples then split up before the newly-single partners got together in a karaoke love swap. Heather Whiteley, , had been with Darren Smith, , for two years before they went along to the event at their local bowls club.Heather said: “I met Darren through Facebook. He was sweet, understanding and easy to talk to.“We were always up for a laugh so when we saw there was a karaoke evening being held at the bowls club, we agreed to go together. “I love a bit of karaoke and it sounded like fun.” While there they got talking to another couple – Peter Brettell, , and Susie Spencer, . Heather said: “We kind of knew Peter and Susie through the local community anyway. “They were involved in running a few karaoke nights and events locally. We had a great time that night, enjoying a sing-song and a few drinks together.” From that meeting in February last year, the two couples became friends, meeting a few times a week for a drink or a singalong session. Heather said: “We added each other on Facebook too and would chat on there. Susie and Peter seemed like a great couple. We weren’t super close, but we all got on well. “But in time, my relationship with Darren hit the rocks. We’d been ­having problems for some time but it took us a while to admit it.  “We were arguing all the time and eventually, in May , we split. “It was a really sad, dficult time, and I was still reeling from the break-up when I found out that Peter and Susie had ended their own relationship, too.” With both couples having split, Heather reached out to Susie’s former partner Peter. “I thought he might need someone to talk to,” she said. It turned out Heather had hit the right note.  “Peter wasn’t the type to talk about his feelings but he admitted he was ­struggling after his split from Susie.“And, as we got ­chatting, it ­became apparent wehad more in ­common than we thought.“We confided in each other. We realised we were the only ones who truly understood what we were both going through.” The pair became a shoulder for each other to cry on and soon began spending more time together. Peter said: “Susie and I had been together for two years but we were arguing a lot before we broke up. We just weren’t a team any more. “Darren knew Susie’s family through the karaoke nights. “We weren’t really close with Darren and Heather but we saw them in the pub quite often and would also chat on Facebook. “When all this happened, I turned to Heather for support.  “I don’t have many friends I can talk to about emotional stuff so when Heather asked meI wanted to talk, I opened up and it went from there. “She really listened to what I had to say and I wasn’t used to that. I felt I hadn’t been able to talk to Susie properly for months.” Heather added: “In time, Peter and I started to get close. I started to feel butterflies in my stomach for the first time in years. “It wasn’t long before we became a couple.”  Love Both pairs have since found lasting love after the karaoke carry-on.

The two sides of the busy motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, separate just before the farm house comes into view, snaking around the property before merging together again a few miles further on. For decades, urban myths have surrounded the white washed building that makes up Stott Hall Farm and the fields around it. The motorway was built in the s and rumour has it that the farmer it belonged to, Ken Wild, had refused to sell it when plans for the six-lane carriage way were approved. It is believed that planners had to come up with way round the problem and decided to simply build the road round it. Ken had been living there with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep. But rather than being a rebel who was taking a stand against a huge new motorway, it seems that Ken was nothing of the sort. A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway. Filmed in  and released a few years ago by the British Film Institute , Cleggaposs People explains why the road could never have been built on the farm. Journalist Michael Clegg explains: A geological fault beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical for engineers to leave it rather than blast through and destroy it. Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm. But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all. Eleven years ago, Jill Falkingham bought the house along with her husband Phil, and the couple moved in with their son, John-William.  They completely renovated the home, which dates back to , and Jill has always insisted itaposs no dferent to living anywhere .“Traffic is very close,” she told  the Manchester Evening News  . “But it’s always windy here, which takes the pollution away.

Kate, who has a keen ­interest in early years development, spoke to parents Rebecca Atwood and John Gill about what it was like to have a baby during the lockdown. The Duchess, , cooed at baby Max, who was just  hours old, and said: “Hello! Very nice to meet you! This is ­definitely a first, I think!” After sending “huge congratulations” to his parents, Kate added: “He is so sweet. When did you have him ” When told he had arrived at pm the previous night, she replied: “My goodness, you must be exhausted! Kate’s surprise ‘bedside visit’ came during a call to staff at Kingston Hospital’s Maternity Unit on April . She did a two-day work placement at the south west London hospital last November, and this time heard from staff about their experiences during the pandemic. Six midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while one pulled on personal protective equipment and took a ­laptop to introduce mum-of-three Kate to baby Max and his parents. The Duchess dialled in from Anmer Hall in Norfolk – where the Cambridges have been staying during the lockdown – and heard that the hospital had dealt with a rise in referrals for anxiety. Jo Doumouchtsi, perinatal mental health midwe, said: “The main issues women are having are around coming into hospital and catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.  “They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.” And midwe Jenner Tshibamba added: “We want women to know we’re here, we’re still open. “Even with what’s ­going on, we’re here to listen to you, we’re still here to make sure we provide you with the best care for your pregnancy, for your baby and support your family.”  The hospital’s perinatal mental health team – which includes psychiatrists and mental health nurses – sends out a weekly newsletter that gives mums advice for coping during the pandemic and lists what ­services are available. Kate said: “That’s probably such a valuable tool for them now. To you all there, you do an amazing job, ­honestly, as you say, ­babies come all the time. “The fact you’re having to work in these dficult times… well done.”  Kate told the midwives how she and husband William had spoken to NHS staff about the importance of reaching outthey were feeling low. She said: “They don’t feel they can reach out because they feel guilty for doing it, which is extraordinary. “With new mums and parents and families, they don’t want to feel like they’re overburdening but it is so ­important to reach out and ask for help when you do need it.” As part of their work to support people during the pandemic, the Duke and Duchess have created a new text service dedicated to key workers.  Leading mental health charities will work together to provide -hour ­support to those under pressure while millions of us stay at home to save lives. Mind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation will provide support and online resources to the key workers keeping Britain ­moving through the crisis. William, , said the text service would be their “top priority” in the coming months. And ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week – which starts tomorrow – Kate said new mums should also speak upthey need help. Typically, around one in  women experience a mental illness during ­pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth. Kate said that in her experience, talking to other mums helped.  She said: “You realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually, what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one going through it. “To be able to share it in whatever way, whether it’s on the phone, through social media – in any form – ­it does ­normalise some of these anxieties.” Using a video call to ­connect with others was exactly what Princess Charlotte did on her fth birthday on Saturday. Kate and William threw a party for their daughter at home, with lots of fun and games for her and brothers, George, six and Louis, two.

Jake White thought it was just a strange coincidence that Ross Renforth was sporting an Adidas cap and a Swatch watch just like his. In fact Renforth had just broken into his home and taken them and the only coincidence was he then went to the restaurant where his victim happened to be working. It was only when the worker ed to his home in Alnwick, Northumberland, that he realised it had been entered, searched and his belongings had been stolen. Prosecutor Neil Jones told Newcastle Crown Court: While he was working at McDonalds, he had unwittingly served the defendant, who came into McDonalds as a customer.  Mr White had noticed the person he was serving was wearing an Adidas cap with a white peak. He thought it was strange and thought aposIaposve got one like thatapos. A black Swatch was found on the floor on the customer side of the counter, where Mr White had been working. When it was found he said aposIaposve got a watch like thatapos. The reason he was finding it was the defendant had forced entry into the flat. The court heard police found Renforthaposs fingerprints on a bottle of rum inside the flat, which he had helped himself to drinks from, and his blood was found on the front door.  Renforth, , of no fixed address, admitted burglary and was jailed for  months. Judge Robert Spragg told him: You went to McDonaldaposs and Jake White was working there and he recognised the cap and recognised the watch. Kate Barnes, defending, said Renforth was under the influence of negative peers at the time and had been taking drink and drugs.

The source claimed that Harry and Meghan’s initial move to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was triggered when Meghan shouted at a member of Kate’s staff. And the Duchess of Cambridge was said to be horried at Meghan’s approach. The source claimed: “Like many people not used to dealing with servants, Meghan overdoes the imperiousness so on the one hand she wants to be like Diana, a peopleaposs princess, and on the other she wants people to stand to attention when she clicks her fingers.” It’s believed the incident prompted the beginning of discussions about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving Kensington Palace. Meghan’s attitude towards staff soon led to a crop of unflattering nicknames, including Me-Gainapos, the aposDuchess of Dficultapos and even aposDi apos or aposDi Liteapos, it is claimed. Many of the staff, who didn’t know what to make of the American duchess, seemed relieved when she and Harry moved away, Mr Quinnaposs book claims. It meant that a fully refurbished home at Kensington Palace went completely unused.

When it became a go-to shop for the Royal Family, they ended up with a worldwide business and a special invitation. In their own words, they tell their story... One day my we Beatrice went to a little shop on our high street that does personalised presents. They didn’t have what she wanted, so the next day, when she decided to have a go at making it herself, our lives changed for ever. Born in France, we moved to London in . We were struggling to manage the work-le balance as I was in banking, a heavy-going job, and Beatrice had just had our second child. She wanted to go part-time in her office job, but the company refused. She was considering a career change, so when she made her first necklace, it got her thinking. The day after that trip to the high street, she ordered a gold charm and chain from the internet as well as a handheld ‘graver’ . By the end of the day she’d engraved the necklace with the names of our children and was proudly wearing it.  Initially, it was a bit of a hobby. She sat at the kitchen table and began engraving pieces to sell at Christmas fairs and local events. Word of mouth spread in the village and soon she was making jewellery for friends, family and anyone who needed something special to mark an occasion. We decided to set up a website for her creations rather than open a shop and, after a few weeks, her orders slowly grew. She’d started buying the charms and chains and engraving them herself, but once we went online as a unique company, called Merci Maman, she had to design and make the charms herself. I used to help out in evenings and at the weekends and knew we were on to a good thing. It was a slow, old-fashioned process though, and we did it all by hand.  As orders grew, we hired a few people to help and, in , I left my job to join the company. At this point we had seven people working for us and opened a small office a stone’s throw from our house. I too saw the benefits of this kind of work. We had four kids by then and I could take them to school and be home for supper, which was a whole new world for me. I was determined for Merci Maman to be a success. Our USP became the personalisation angle. You can have absolutely anything. Children’s names, love notes, GPS coordinates of where people met or live, you name it, we can do it. We were published in a few magazines and Pippa Middleton ended up buying something from us for a friend. She was so pleased with it, she sent us a thank you letter afterwards! She went on to buy a few more pieces from us for presents. We were thrilled, and it got us thinking of our dream customers.When Kate Middleton was pregnant with her first child in  my we and I both said, ‘Wow, imagineshe had a necklace with the name of the future prince or princess on it ’. She is an icon across the whole world and an inspiration to so many women. So, when George was born, we made her a necklace with his name on and a little ‘W’ charm on it also for William. We sent it to Pippa so she could gt it to her sister from herself. Well, you can imagine how we felt when we saw a picture of Kate wearing it. The excitement was sky high! Sure enough, all over the newspapers were pictures of Kate wearing the necklace we’d made for her. What happened next was a big article about Kate’s jewellery, which went viral. And there was our necklace. The effect was instant. We had , hits on the website in three days – equivalent to all of the traffic we normally get in December, our busiest month. We had to focus on production, getting stock in and we had to recruit to cope. It was very demanding, but extremely exciting!  We had to act fast to get the staff so we could meet the demands of the orders and within weeks we’d expanded to a team of . The necklace had created a buzz worldwide so we had to start shipping all over the world and make sure some of our staff were bilingual so we could translate the website into dferent languages. What followed was three offices – in London, Paris and Berlin – to make sure we could reach everyone. Business went insane and six months on we were a dferent company in terms of figures. We even gained a few more royal customers. Mike Tindall has bought a few pieces for his we, the Queen’s granddaughter Zara, and whenever Royals order they use the website, just like normal customers. After , we had such a huge burst internationally that we applied for The Queens Award, which is an honour awarded to a few select UK businesses every year. We won for our contribution to exports and my we and I were invited to Buckingham Palace. After mingling with the guests someone asked us to head to a private room with them. We followed and there sat the Queen, who wanted to have a private chat with us. We were in the room for quite a long time and she asked us all sorts of questions. When we’d moved to England, how the business started. She was interested in all the ins and outs! She didn’t even realise Kate had a necklace when we told her. It was amazing and I’ll never forget it.  An hour later we were drinking champagne in the Palace and a lady came up to us and said, ‘Oh you’re the French couple who set up the jewellery company – the Queen told me all about you!’ She had remembered all the details. Even that we have four children. It was incredible how she absorbed the information. It’s  years since the company started and we now do rings, bracelets, earrings, accessories and a full men’s range. Working with my we has been great – Beatrice is good at the designing side of things, and I stick to e-commerce. Plus we parent together well as we split work and family time evenly. The kids are between seven and  so they’re too young to get involved, but they do love to help us package up parcels and to go on set at photoshoots. The necklace Kate has is called the Duchess and it’s the same price it always was, £. It’s important for us it’s affordable for everyone. We also practise our work-le balance ethos. Everyone who works for us can create their own schedule to make sure they have enough family time.

A map released by the Office for National Statistics suggests that most fatalities linked to Covid- have been in densely populated cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester, and along the transport routes which link them together. However, areas which are further away appear to have been spared the worst of the highly infectious virus. The ONS data suggests that large parts of Wales and the south west and east of England have been untouched by the deadly bug. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The map - which only covers England and Wales - analyses , deaths linked to Covid- registered between March  and April . In Cornwall alone, there are  towns which have not seen a single le lost, including St Breward, Tredethy and Lanivet. In Suffolk, at least  areas have not recorded any fatalities linked to the pandemic, including Hadleigh and Yoxford, with a further  in Norfolk, featuring Hoveton, Horning, Cawston and Reepham. The same is true for nine towns and villages in the county of Conwy in Wales, seven in Pembrokeshire, five in Gwynedd and another five in Ceredigion.In the New Forest national park in Hampshire there have been no deaths in the Milford and Lymington south area, while in neighbouring Dorset, places such as Bovington, Wool and Lulworth have no recorded deaths. Despite London being a particular hotspot for the virus - accounting for more than half of all of the nationaposs deaths - the capital has three areas which have yet to succumb. Lambeth North, Borough and Southwark Street, and North Acton are all yet to record a single fatality. It comes after separate figures revealed a shocking North-South ide has opened up during the coronavirus crisis - with people in Northern communities and the Midlands at greater risk of contracting the killer bug. People in poorer areas are twice as likely to die from the virus as those in affluent parts of the country, experts have said. New research shows that Middlesbrough and Walsall have the highest rates of infection in the country - with Wolverhampton, Gateshead and St Helens also among the places where the disease has spread widely. Figures released by the Centre for Progressive Policy this week show that of the  places with the highest infection rates, just one - Luton - is in the south.

Under the UKaposs current lockdown rules, you must stay at home unless shopping for food, travelling to a medical appointment or job that cannot be done from home or taking exercise once a day. This has led to police forces up and down the country ordering sunbathers to clear out of public parks and green spaces. However, some experts believe the risk of transmitting coronavirus from one person to another is much lower outside. Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, has previously argued there is no evidence to suggest that sunbathers can infect other park users with the virus eventhey remained less than two metres apart.

The Sir Henry Dale fellow fears infection rates could pick up signicantlypeople celebrate the easing of social distancing by coming together in large groups. His research team found that the average rate of infection of one coronavirus carrier in a typical social setting is three people. When large groups meet in badly ventilated indoor spaces however, that number triples.

As soon as measures are lted, we risk being back where we started, facing exponential growth. The associate professor said that events with  to  people were regularly being brought to their attention, with around  people regularly infected by one person. His suggestion to the Government is that social restrictions remain in place until at least next year, meaning the Christmas period would be dferent from the average year.  Yesterday the Government offered hints of when dferent parts of British le could be back up and running. Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.”  Boris Johnson  is expected to unveil a roadmap on Thursday on how to end lockdown. But he will avoid committing to dates. The timing depends on the “R”, or reproductive rate, of the virus, which must be under one – with infections continually falling.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn these crazy uncertain times, it can somehow help to find yourself in a place that’s, well, not of this world. And many may say the time-warped town of Cassadaga – between Daytona and Orlando in the hot, swampy heartland of Florida – is certainly a tad off the planet. But it also draws a multitude of curious earthly visitors who flock here to be reconnected with the past, have incurable ailments cured, and see into their future. Because when it comes to mediums, Cassadaga goes large.And, shortly before the state’s coronavirus lockdown, I found myself sitting in front of one of its other-worldly inhabitants.“I’m getting the word Apple,” says Gypsy Phoenix mysteriously, her trance-like eyes rolling back from the tarot cards and crystals spread across the table. Then she says I needed more lavender in my le, which was being guarded by a group of spirit guides – and told me I was already looking forward to retirement. The spirits, she added, were very strong during my “reading”… And so they should be in a town billed as the Psychic Capital of the World – with its  or so rickety painted wooden houses home to more than  mediums, healers and psychics. Since , Cassadaga has been a sanctuary to the mystic – and, some would argue, the downright crazy. It’s Spiritualist Camp was founded then by a New Yorker who had been instructed by his Native American spirit guide Seneca to start a spiritual centre.  So George Colby made the long trek south and found the ideal spot in Florida’s wilderness, buying up  acres. After a bout of tuberculosis, he claimed the area’s spring water healed him. The legend goes that when he died in , the waters started to dry up, which many saw as an omen. But that only made it a bigger draw – and it’s been on the US National Register of Historic Places since . Now holidaymakers who forgo the delights of Mickey and Minnie  miles further south are free to wander around its attractions, such as the Spirit Lake and Fairy Trail, and sit on the Devil’s Chair – in the local cemetery, of course.  Cassadaga is split in two, separated by a single street and around  years. On one side sits the town’s church maintaining the traditional spiritualist belief system Colby established in the s. On the other, s New Agers have their centre of worship in and around the Cassadaga Hotel which, as you’d expect, is haunted with “friendly” spirits – one an Irish tenor called Arthur who leaves a scent trail of cigars and gin. Most rooms have no phones or TVs so as to not interfere with “spiritual pathways” and there’s no hot water after pm.  But step beyond its doors and visitors are promised they’ll “embrace the energy of the many spirits who reside in this enchanted inn”. They’re also told: “Don’t forget to bring your camera. Many of our guests have gotten unbelievable pictures of Spirit Energies in and around the hotel.” The owners claim it is a “respected Spiritual Sanctuary” and add: “It is our mission to help those who are seeking guidance from the Highest Angelic Realms, and it’s truths.”  Walking into the foyer, visitors are welcomed by a board naming the mediums on sht – Gypsy, Misty, Doreen, Inez, Kat and Ron – and their price list, cash only. African voodoo dolls and handmade potions “starting from  bucks” can be bought from hotel receptionist DJ. When I arrived and askedshe had sensed I was going to turn up, she looked at me blankly – clearly not a possessor of the pricey psychic powers.  But any unsurprising hints of mockery or cynicism simply wash over Cassadaga’s inhabitants. Clairvoyant Jotte ‘the ine unicorn’ Schaffer,  – who works in the Psychic Shop – assured me the “positive vortexes” in the town only brought good energy. “People need to come with no expectations and an open mind,” she said. “What I do with my readings is plant seeds and harvest guidance.” Usually, up to  people a day visit the shop, but coronavirus has seen numbers plummet.  “We have been predicting ‘the great awakening’ for many years, and it is finally here,” she said. “It is an amazing time to seek spiritualism. We hope this helps recalibrate humanity.” The shop offers a crystal healing bed treatment – it costs a dollar a minute and is said to relieve stress, soothe anxiety, and reconnect people to themselves. For  you get an “aura report” which found I had a blue-indigo air about me indicating a “communicative, loving, loyal, sensitive and helpful” person – yet one who was suffering stress and read asI may be on my way out. Which brings me back to that table in the hotel with Gypsy.  I handed over a wallet-recalibrating  bucks for a half-hour consultation in a room decked out with crystals, trinkets, pictures and ious dolls. The smell of incense hit me like a train. She dealt the tarot cards quicker than a Las Vegas croupier. Within seconds she was on the scent of the inner self I didn’t know. “We want you to work with things like lavender and get a lavender pillow,” she said, adding that I loved ice cream. Before I could reply: “Doesn’t everybody ” she revealed I have five spirit guides in my le. Most people only have two, apparently. “There is one Irish and one’s Welsh. They’re cousins,” she said. “Like they’re sort of jokesters, but you know, sometimes you’re just sort of closed off to it, and you’re, like, focused on the serious.  “And they’re like, ‘Come on man, open up, you know, you know, be happy’.  “There is also an older woman somewhere, like in her nineties. Almost like a grandmother’s spirit guide. Not your grandmother. She helps calm you and soothe you when you are feeling overwhelmed.” Apple Then she told me the other two were a brother and sister both under  “helping balance the male and female aspects of your inner child”. Her best advice was about my financial future – and that “on your way out” verdict I’d had. “I hear you’re looking forward to retirement. You’re not quite there yet,” she said. Phew! “You’re still sort of very young, but spirit guides recently have been really on at people about saving money and the stock market.  “So wait until this panic is sort of over and about a month or two and start sort of buying the cheaper stocks, all the stocks that have fallen watch them bounce.” All this time I’d been wondering just what she meant by her trance-like uttering of the word “Apple”. Now, the big reveal.

The advert reads: During these hard times Covid- has thrown many in a tail spin... If you are a submissive femaleyears old and into the SM lestyle on a moderate to extreme level... and wanting to barter session playtime once per week in lieu of rent we should talk. A producer for Inside Edition then responded to the advert, posing as a potential renter. The publication reports that the landlord replied,  saying he wanted to try the arrangement first at a hotel room and gave bizarre instructions that left no doubt about his intentions.Alycia Powers, who posed as the potential renter, said: He says to wear my hair down, no jewelry and minimal makeup. And then meet him in the room, undress and put on a pair of stilettos he got me. She agreed to meet aposEddieapos at a Days Inn hotel in Long Island, whilst being wired with a hidden camera.  The landlord text Alycia to say he had checked into the hotel, but the producer asked him to meet her at her car, when she and her team revealed who they were to him. When askedhe was trying to take advantage of women in the middle of the pandemic, Eddie responded No. She had the choice to take up on the offer and denied the arrangement was for sex. It is thought that many landlords in the US are trying to take advantage of tenantsapos struggles with rent payments.  In April, a third of tenants across the country were unable to pay their landlords, with a higher number expected in May. Last month, Khara Jabola-Carolus, Executive Director of the  Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women, said sexual harassment by landlords is making lives from women extremely dficult. There was no plan upfront to prepare for the physical and sexual violence from the combination of shelter-in-place, lost income and systemic sexism, Ms Jabola-Carolus said.  In February it was reported that desperate tenants are sleeping with landlords instead of paying rent in a growing “sex for rent” epidemic. A national survey Shelter Scotland recently found that , women nationally said they’d been asked for sex for their tenancies. The Aberdeen Law Project, based at Aberdeen University, invited MSP Kevin Stewart, Detective Sergeant Craig Currie, Mark Thomson from homeless charity Shelter Scotland and Marsha Scott of Scottish Women’s Aid as part of the workshop.  Mr Thomson said there is a “vast amount of under-reporting” on the growing issue, where tenants are asked by landlords to offer sex in exchange for rent. He added: “We are aware anecdotally that it does happen in Aberdeen. Earlier this year a woman urged others to be safe after sharing her messages with a aposlandlordapos who offered to lower rent in exchange for nude photos. Georgia Linehan took to social media to expose aposhow dangerous some people on the internet can beapos in a tweet which has since gained almost , likes. Posting a screenshot of their worrying Whatsapp conversation, she wrote: Thataposs the last time I try and buy a house on Gumtree. She is told it costs £ per month, and she replies to say that sheaposll have a think and let them know her decision in a couple of days.

The four-bedroom home in Louisiana, US, was built in the s and has gained a spooky reputation, meaning no one has dared to move in despite not having to spend a penny to make it theirs. One former resident claims the home is haunted by her great grandmother, who is aposwell knownapos to stir cooking left unattended in the kitchen and move the pots around.Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, took to Facebook to share snaps of the home in a bid to convince someone to move and restore the home so they could build new property on the land.However, it appears potential suitors were put off by a flood of comments below from ex-residents and visitors who reported the creepy goings-on they claim to have experienced. Sylvia admitted sheaposs heard aposall the storiesapos about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to banish her. But she remains hopeful the aposhistory of the homeapos can be saved, and itaposs free for anyone to take on to aposmove to another location for restorationapos. Former resident Dawn Vallot DeClout claims the house is occupied by the spirit of her great grandmother Adele, a ft in woman who lived until about  and was known for meddling in the kitchen. Dawnaposs family owned the -acre plot the house was built on from , and her great grandmother died in the front room in .  Dawn, whose family moved out in the s, said: We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but sheaposs not menacing at all. She was probably like ft in and weighed about lb. She lived to be almost  and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around. She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove. You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen.  Sylvia said there is a lot of rumours surrounding the house, with apossome really cute stories about it being hauntedapos. One suitor had offered to take the home, but had a change of heart when they discovered it would cost about £, to move and reassemble.  Sylvia believesthe two-storey, , square foot property was kept close by, it would only cost about half of that. However, locals comparing it to a notorious house in Amityville, where a man shot and killed six members of his family, isnapost making it any easier.  The post on Facebook got hundreds of responses with one writing: Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that. We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it. Another replied: Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it. A third said they visited the home and reported aposa lot of weird noises in the ceilings and wallsapos. Sylvia is worried she may not be able to find someone to take on the project due to the costs after any interest following the Facebook post quickly fell away.

Pictures have emerged capturing the clever kitty walking with her kitten in her mouth, then dropping the poorly feline in front of medics in one of the treatment rooms.

Doctors also then took some time to give the resourceful moggy milk and food to keep her relaxed after she gave birth near the hospital. It was not revealed what was wrong with the kitten, but the doctors apparently managed to sort the problem out quickly by checking over both furry patients. The two felines were then handed over to a local vet, before Turkish media then confirmed they were doing well with no cause for concern.

More than , Americans have now lost their lives to the killer bug, a death toll greater than that suffered during the Vietnam War. China has suffered , deaths from the virus, and has officially recorded , cases. It is widely believed that the coronavirus first jumped from animals to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, a transport hub in Hubei province. However, alternative theories have begun to surface and Trump said on Thursday that he is confident Covid- may have in fact originated in a Chinese virology lab. The US President declined, however, to describe the evidence behind his claim. China has been accused of misleading the world about the severity of the outbreak, and there are growing calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus.

The despot is likely to order a “wave of public executions” and fresh nuclear threats against the West to re-establish credibility after being off grid for weeks. Insiders believe the dynastic Supreme Leader of the world’s most secretive country fled the Covid- outbreak sweeping his country – or was taken ill. Kim, , was even rumoured to have died of heart issues after he last appeared in public on April . But he has now appeared in public for the first time in  days, according to the country’s state media. KCNA news agency reported the despot cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertiliser factory on Friday. It added people “broke into thunderous cheers of hurrah” when he appeared, with his younger sister Kim Yo-jong, , alongside him. South Korean intelligence – usually the most reliable source on Pyongyang-related rumours – had earlier confirmed he was alive and well.  And satellite images showed the dictator’s personal train at the coastal retreat of Wonsan. In the past, women have joined Kim on his train – while sex slaves forcibly taken from universities await at his lair. But this is no ordinary vacation. Rumours of Kim’s death were triggered when the fatty food-loving heavy drinker missed celebrations marking the founding of North Korea on April .  There were also suggestions that Kim Yo-jong would grab power. Now experts warn her brother’scould herald a spate of killings of members of the Pyongyang old-guard in order to reinforce his position. In  Kim ordered the murder of his -year-old uncle and several loyal officers, and imprisoned  officials for alleged treachery.  Professor Natasha Lindstaedt, an author and global expert on despot-led regimes said: “He’s always had this very vindictive pattern of showing his strength by killing people. It sends a clear message.“The military has to keep him happy. The smallest thing is perceived as disloyalty. I think he may have sheltered from coronavirus and any fear of a coup plot would mean he’d come back with a vengeance.”Prof Lindstaedt, Deputy Dean at the University of Essex, added that Kim’s sister is now in a highly “precarious position”.  A western security source echoed the risk of a Kim backlash, saying: “I believe we could expect a violent taking out of any perceived threat amongst Kim’s inner-circle. “Any imagined slight against him would be regarded as dissent – and could result in a public execution or being sent to a jail camp. “Inevitably, this will end in bloodshed and more threats.” Kim has jailed thousands of innocent civilians in his brutal work camps during his eight-year rule of horror, killing many in street executions and public murders.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc john nelms lifts lid spfl vote u turn","story":"Ever since his deciding ballot ended the lower-league season, John Nelms has been cast, by some, as a sinner in the SPFL vote saga.The Dens Park supremo was front and centre of the crisis that engulfed Scottish football this month after his ‘no’ vote failed to reach the SPFL’s email account and left him with the fate of the game in his hands.Five days later, he switched Dundee’s vote to a ‘yes’, passing the resolution that ended the   campaign in the bottom three isions.Speculation over what sparked Nelms’ change of heart has raged ever since, but the Dundee chief has remained silent.Until today.Finally, in a sit down interview with Tele Sport, Nelms has lted the lid on the events of the last month, and on his hopes for Scottish football’s future – and we are giving his story to you exactly as he gave it to us.George Cran: You stated at the start you were going to vote ‘no’ to the SPFL’s resolution, what were your thoughts on it to begin with John Nelms: From the beginning, I didn’t want anything to go out that would hurt anybody at all. We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/DNic_WeeCook_Barry_Downs-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"local independent eateries weather the coronavirus storm but life post lockdown looks very different","story":"For independent cafes, restaurants and takeaways, le post-lockdown is likely going to look very dferent.The hospitality industry has taken a signicant economic hit in recent weeks many eateries closed their doors to the public not knowingthey would get a chance to serve their loyal customers once more.But there are those, across the country, who have been focusing their efforts on navigating a new #normal#. For some it has meant shting their business to an online model, for others it has meant installing Perspex screens in-store.Yet one thing is certain for all of them # le will never be the same again.We spoke to three local businesses about the true impact of coronavirus.Hayley Wilkes, owner of the WeeCOOK Kitchen in Carnoustie, has focused her efforts on trying to stay ahead of the game so that the business can continue to flourish in the months and years to come.#We#ve tried to stay ahead of the game in terms of anticipating what might happen,# she said.#To be honest that was probably the hardest part in the run-up to the lockdown, not knowing day by day what was going to happen.#In the first few days, it almost felt like we were changing the business every day to keep up with the constantly shting guidelines.#We#ve worked our damnedest to provide a service for the community, not only here for the caravan park # whose residents are mostly vulnerable and elderly # but for the entire community.#But we also had to make sure we were keeping the staff safe. A lot of people were saying, #you should close, it#s the safe thing to do,# but I said, #no, we#re going to stick to guidelines#.#It has been a quick change. We had staff training which was for the opening up of the season and then, within  days, it essentially became survival training.#The staff have been absolutely fantastic. I#ve got three apprentices who are doing the Skills Development Scotland scheme with Dundee and Angus College and I believe they#re some of the only apprentices in the country who are continuing their apprenticeship.#Despite having to rapidly adapt to the changing circumstances, WeeCOOK Kitchen has managed to retain every member of staff.#I had just taken many of them on, with some of them only having worked three shts. I didn#t want to lose them, it broke my heart,# Hayley said. vw, px\"  #I thought, what can we do to keep this business going  Being so small, with the kind of customer base that we have built, we were in the perfect position to adapt, to improvise and to try and get through it # and not only survive but try and have some kind of remnants of a business at the end of it.#If it meant that we had to completely change the way we worked then we would do that.#Already there are things that we#re doing dferently that we hope, once it opens up again, we can adapt. The way that we#re doing business now, we can almost forecast what we#re going to get.#But we miss the restaurant we miss the customers and the interaction and that whole hospitality thing. We#ve been trying to bring it to the customers instead.#After closing their doors back in March, the team quickly introduced a delivery service, which has been a resounding success.Hayley said: #We#ve never done delivery before, ever. It#s a whole new concept to us and a whole new route to customers.#We#ve actually extended and grown our business outwith our local community now. We started by going to the towns and areas where we knew we had a small client base but now we are going further afield. We#re planning to go to Glasgow next week and St Andrews at some point.Assistant manager, Emelye Macqueen, added: #One evening I decided to put it on local Facebook pages and the response was amazing.#The reach went from , to , in the space of  days which is quite an achievement.#So what does the future look like for the hospitality industry  Will le ever revert to what it was before #I don#t think le can go back to how it was,# Hayley said.#It#s already an industry that has been working on such fine margins. For years and years it has always been about cost.#You can#t compete with the big boys and, for a little indie business like ours, it#s dficult.#I hope [when all this is over] that people don#t just get overexcited and go rushing back to the big chains. I hope they remember the small businesses who have kept them going.#The team at Scran Fitness Food, which has been trading for three years, have had to get creative with what they#re offering customers.When Jason Myles first started the company, which now has a production facility at West Pitkerro Industrial Estate and a shop on the Nethergate, his focus was on creating and distributing healthy meal plans.Now, amid the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, he#s introduced home favourites # which they#ve dubbed Scrations # to the menu. These include dishes such as macaroni cheese and steak pie.He said: #The main part of our business is the healthy side of things so it can be quite off-putting for some, especially elderly people.#We#ve had a lot of people messaging us, even before all this happened, asking us about it.#It has been really popular, even amongst those customers who usually order the healthier stuff so its gone down really well and is definitely something that we#re planning to continue.#We threw it out there, just to see what sort of response we#d get, but obviously we#ve been busier than we expected.#We#ve lost the revenue from the shop which is obviously a big hit and we could still open but all the offices in the city centre where our usual trade comes from have closed.#So we#ve taken the decision to keep that closed and work out of the unit for now, focusing on the meal delivery service.#We#ve been probably busier than we would normally be in the healthy side of things but, instead of laying off the guys that were working at the shop, we thought we#d bring them up to the unit and try and get a bit busier so we can keep everyone employed and not have to furlough anyone.#We thought it would be wise to do things that are more appealing to everyone. On Saturdays we#ve been doing something called cheat meals. It’s hot food deliveries from the unit and it#s all your indulgent foods, like burgers and wraps.#We introduced that because we noticed that a lot of the takeaways in Dundee shut so the ones that remained open were getting overrun with hundreds of orders so there were three-hour waiting times.#We thought thatthere was demand for it then we might as well do it. We#ve done that for three weeks now and it has been really successful.#You could just stop and let it [coronavirus] get the better of you but we thought, as long as we keep busy and we keep introducing new things, it#s always going to be popular and everyone needs to eat.#goodeats.io posthouseinvergowriePosted by The Post House Coffee Co onMonday,  April The Post House Coffee Co in Invergowrie, which first opened its doors in November , has swtly adopted new practices to ensure the business is able to continue providing for its loyal customers.Craig Mckenzie, the cafe#s owner, said: #When it was clear coronavirus had reached our shores we took proactive steps like installing hand sanitiser gel for customers and staff and removing some of our tables from the restaurant to give everyone a little more space between themselves and other diners.#Once the severity of the pandemic became clearer we experienced an immediate drop in revenues of %. Cafes were then told to close. We were all absolutely devastated and of course did so # but just for a short period of  days whilst we got our heads around everything.#Since the beginning of the pandemic we have gone from less than % of sales being takeout to now solely operating a click and collect or doorstep delivery service.#We no longer allow customers inside the cafe at all so it was a challenge to work out how to still provide a good service to our valued customers whilst ensuring social distance measures were respected.#For Craig, one of the biggest challenges they faced was the process of furloughing staff.#Retaining our fantastic team and getting the doors safely open again so we had some income was our main priority,# he said.#The process of furloughing some of our staff and bringing the remainder into work was a challenge in itself.#And whilst it has been dficult, there have been some undeniable positives that Craig hopes will continue once normality resumes.He said: #We have always offered an afternoon tea service but with lockdown, and our new takeout and delivery service, we decided to adapt to make it suitable to enjoy at home and the response has been unbelievable.#We have had people ordering separate platters to share afternoon tea over the garden fence with neighbours, friends sending them on anniversaries and entire families ordering it to be delivered to dferent households at the same time to share over Zoom video calls.#We have noticed that everyone seems to be a little more appreciative of each other. We all get caught up in our own lives and,anything, lockdown has given us all time to appreciate others around us. Customers are sending us well wishes with thanks for providing a service during lockdown.#I’m not sure we will be getting back to anything like it was before lockdown anytime soon. When restrictions are eventually lted, I think a lot of the practices introduced and social distancing measures will remain.#I think customers will always want to have a little more space than they did previously, hand sanitiser for customer use will be expected in the cafes and those customers who have become accustomed to having brunch delivered on a lazy Sunday morning will still want it delivered post-lockdown.#A round-up of some of the places offering food delivery and collection services locally\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp a-round-up-of-some-of-the-places-offering-food-delivery-and-collection-services-locally embed # secretlOCQMOfrt\" data-secret\"lOCQMOfrt\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"screen-siren-mae-west-stopped-traffic-glasgow-visit","story":"ldquoCHILDREN adore me, cooed screen siren Mae West when she met a young fan in Glasgow during the heyday of her career."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air , usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in some of the towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing in early-mid August, to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates that the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for this decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, contact the Argyll bird recorder Jim Dickson by email at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver. But these exciting plans looked to be scuppered with the imposition of lockdown.Thankfully, though, postman Keith Borthwick came to the rescue, explained Lisa.She says: \"He made sure that every house received a copy of the newsletter with their mail. Feedback has been brilliant. Itrsquos proving a great resource to help people access local shops.The village has also created a highly productive WhatsApp group, which is proving to be a \"great way\" to keep in touch with residents in isolation, says local volunteer Sonia Kelly.ldquoShoppers message when theyrsquore heading out, and those in need then get in contact,\" says Sonia. \"The system works well and is based on being neighbourly. Therersquos so much community activity taking place, itrsquos bringing everyone together in the most resourceful way.Jane McNeil is also one of Newsteadrsquos busy shoppers. ldquoI started volunteering because I wanted to help those who had made me feel welcome since moving to the village,\" she says.\"It started with a couple of neighbours and has grown since then. Irsquom a great believer in treating others as I would hope to be treated. With so many new friendships being forged, my hope is that after the pandemic, we can maintain this level of care for our neighbours.Another shopper is Jackie Kerr, who helps out a couple of the villages older residents. ldquoI shop a few times a week for Nancy Howieson, who is , and her mother Georgina Paterson ndash who recently celebrated her th birthday. They live separately and are usually very independent. So, itrsquos a dficult time for them now, but Irsquom happy to help in any way I can.Nancy and Georgina are well known around Melrose, where they founded Tweedbank Art Club and put on regular shows. ldquoWe love to paint, says Nancy. ldquoWe are the best of friends and usually see each other every day. Mum has led an exciting le including travelling the world and being a maid at Buckingham Palace for Princess Alice. Shersquos a bit fed up as she likes to get out but is still managing to paint.Whilst her mother continues to paint her way through the lockdown, Nancy has been busy tackling her garden. ldquoI try not to bother folk, but my next-door neighbour has been such a help offering to cut my grass and digging out some tree roots. Everyone in the village is being really friendly.With so many currently living in isolation, volunteers are also reaching out by phone. ldquoIf people arenrsquot on the Internet, itrsquos easy for them to be left out, says Liz Ellis, who has lived in Newstead for  years. ldquoTherefore a few of us are making regular phone calls to people all over the village just to say hello, seethey need anything and have a friendly chat. Irsquove never experienced anything like this in Newstead before. I canrsquot get over the amount of support being offered everyone is desperate to help each other.,params: .pushThe Neate family are also playing their role in raising village spirits. Toby, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother Rueben, along with other Newstead children, have been displaying colourful paintings in their windows and have decorated the village phone box with rainbows. ldquoIt makes us really happy that our art is helping to keep the village smiling, says Toby.Meanwhile, dad Tristan, who manages Neate Maintenance, has offered to help Newsteadrsquos army of NHS workers. ldquoThe pandemic is putting pressure on many key workers who are working extremely long hours. Im sure they have little time for gardening right now. In , Irsquod like to thank them by volunteering to their cut grass or do some weeding.Lisa, the resilience co-ordinator, says shes \"never felt prouder\" of the village.ldquoCoordinating the resilience group is a pleasure,\" she says. \"Wersquore seeing so many incredible acts of kindness, often between complete strangers.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Our teachers will estimate grades using all evidence available to them, with support from their subject faculties, wider school teams and from our central education team.The SQA says its approach to awarding grades is based on safe and secure certication following public health advice and maintaining the integrity and credibility of the qualications system.Schools and colleges will be asked to provide the SQA with estimates on pupilsrsquo achievements, grades, bands and rank based on their performance so far in subject activities.This will provide an overall judgement from those the SQA describes as ldquobest placed to do so, with submissions due by May .The SQA will then check and validate the estimates it receives and look at prior assessments undertaken by pupilsthey are available ndash for example, Higher results for an Advanced Higher pupil.The schoolsrsquo previous history in estimating attainment will be considered and SQA will hold Awarding Meetings with its subject experts.Results will be delivered to learners by August  and students are encouraged to register for MySQA to receive their results by text and or email.The appeals process will remain free for schools and colleges so they can advocate on their pupilsrsquo behalfthe results do not reflect the candidatersquos achievements.The SQA has an exams QA for parents and pupils on its website, www.sqa.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"athelstaneford-primary-school-takes-talent-show-online","story":"People of all ages in the schoolrsquos catchment area took part, with entrants having five minutes to show off their talent in a video uploaded to the the internet.In total,  entries were submitted, featuring skills such as singing and sports to juggling and memory.So far, the entries have received more than , views and  hours of engagement.Stewart Brown, headteacher at Athelstaneford Primary School, said: ldquoWe are absolutely thrilled with how our online talent show has developed.ldquoTalent shows are a regular occurrence in a lot of schools.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"shop-visit-sting-tail-scorpion-discovered","story":"Adrian Nowak, who lives in Musselburgh town centre, found a dead scorpion lying underneath the fruit while out for a recent shopping trip at the supermarket on Newhailes Road.\"I went to Lidl to get some essentials and I thought about getting melon and found it under one of the melons I picked up - it had been squashed,\" said Mr Nowak, a chef at a local care home, who bought the melon.A spokesperson for Lidl said: \"At Lidl, we pride ourselves on having thorough procedures in place to ensure that our fresh fruit and vegetables are of the highest possible quality for our customers.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Its always beenhis unique selling point ndash natural authority crystallised by a rich vocal timbre oozing gravitas and empathy. Then therersquos that fine moustache ndash a symbol of old-school chivalry, curled snugly around his tunnel of truth like a greying cat warmed by the hot breath of righteousness.If Trevor ever approached you in the city centre, perhaps clad inurine-stained jogging bottoms and uttering a torrentof wordsuncomfortable in its over-familiarity with internalisedchaos, maybe asking for change towards his train fare home, then you still wouldnrsquot hesitate to dig deep ndash evenhanding over yoursmart phone so he could check the stationtimetable online. Trust is everything.Thatrsquos why I believed this establishment-approved Knight of the Realm when he said something so outre thatit came from anyone it wouldhave signalled the end of their tellycareer -UFOs were real. The year was  ndash the fag end of true reality, a few years before the mass fractionalisation, isolationism and grotesque self-glorication bequeathed to us by the digital dawn. No phones, no internet, your gran could whistle the Top Ten and  million folk watched Coronation Street. Before the internet,Ken Barlowrsquos bed-hopping was all teenagers had to learn about sex.This vacuum of yawning nothingness allowed for mass pop culture crazes that infected entire continents with short-lived delirium ndash and in , the brow of the globersquos collective consciousness was hot and sweaty with X-Files fever.In fact, so seismic was the showrsquos influence that ITV saw fit to dedicate an entire eveningrsquos scheduling to UFOs ndash showcased somewhat predictably in the familiar format of a  debate. Nothing that would scare the horses, then ndash or elderly folk too jiggered to get up and change the channel after Corrie.Saucers full of secretsIT was as a prelude to this peculiar pow-wow that host Sir Trevor greeted viewers with an unforgettable soliloquy. ldquoWersquore here tonight not to decideUFOs are real ndash unidentied flying objects clearly are real, he announced, steely-jawed, unblinking. ldquoSomething is in our skies. Wersquore here to discuss what they could be and from where they might originate.It didnrsquot matter that Trevor was likely reading some faceless producerrsquos hyperbolic spiel from an autocue. The signicance lay in the fact someone who didnrsquot cut his own hair or eat roadkill just told the nation UFOs were real.Even unbound by its ubiquitous acronym, unidentied flying objects being legitimised on ITV should have been a cultural watershed ndash a moment where even the most earthbound of cynics recalibrated their stance.Yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the credibility of UFOs has lost much of its worth in terms of cultural currency. Even reputable sightings like the odd darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland recentlybarely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own culture silos.Perhaps thedying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitabledystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and that recentincident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndash including astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and exotic technologies\".Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister and all-powerful occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing themagainst their will.

They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules.

There has been an increase, in some parts of the country, in road traffic by as much as  per cent. Last weekend in my local park, the sun out and the sky an enamel blue, it was like any summer weekend of picknickers, sunbathers and folk passing on paths shoulder to shoulder.Nicola Sturgeon, in yesterdays daily briefing, put the increase in vehicle journeys down to a straining against lockdown conditions. \"You might feel you deserve it,\" she said, \"After weeks of restraint. Believe me, I really understand all of that.\"Were at around six weeks now and people are missing people, people are missing the things they previously took for granted. They have kept up with social distancing and washed their hands until the skin began to chafe. Tempers are also chafing.Some are in strict adherence to the guidance. Others have let their guard down as times gone on. These two groups dont make for a good mix.And so to face masks. The First Minister this week made the suggestion that citizens might like to cover their mouth and nose when they go to places where a higher volume of people make social distancing dficult, for example at the supermarket or local shops, or on public transport.Just a recommendation, nothing compulsory. That could have been that, but no.The advice until now has been that masks make very little dference and are not recommended. Jason Leitch, the governments National Clinical Director, only at the beginning of April was very clear that wearing masks was not the right way forward.But, as Professor Leitch pointed out, we are in a rapidly changing situation and advice, too, will rapidly change. The issue was not helped by Professor Hugh Pennington appearing on radio and television to say that face coverings are \"very poor\" and offer \"little protection\".Waters were further muddied by constitutional grumbles, at Holyrood splitting in a dferent direction to Westminster. ITVs political reporter was given short shrt when asking Ms Sturgeonthe conflicting advice north and south of the border would be confusing.\"Are you reporting on confusion,\" she lobbed at Peter MacMahon, \"Or are you actually helping to cause confusion \"The wearing of face coverings is a seemingly straightforward piece of advice and not compulsory, so you can sympathise with frustrations over what turned into a protracted discussion.At the same time, the public is being asked to absorb an entirely new lexicon and, for those of us with no science background at all, weigh up entirely new information and come to a choice that, were told, could save lives. Or increase the death rate.There is clearly a moral pressure there for iniduals to do the right thing by making the right choice - and a societal pressure. It was mere weeks ago that we started talking about social distancing and now it has become part of the language asit had always been common parlance.Now were reading about aerosol transmission, hearing about small scale studies into face coverings, being given conflicting advice from prominent scientists then being told we shouldnt feel confused.There are countless suggestions for how best to wear a face covering. how to make them, the best materials to use, how to wear them and how to safely dispose of them. Its a lot of information to process.At the supermarket on Wednesday, I saw no one wearing homespun face coverings and three people wearing medical-style masks. Its obviously a small sample size but the message didnt seem to have immediately prompted action.However, the response I saw online to the suggestion of face coverings was that,its possible they might make some small positive change, people should wear them.Its not the time for widespread public debates about conflicting studies and is the time for unity and collective action. If there is small gain and no loss, then its dficult to argue against getting on board.However, that takes us back to fraying tempers. Bruce Adamson, the children and young peoplersquos commissioner for Scotland, along with a coalition of charities, has written to supermarkets to ask that parents with children are not turned away or shamed by staff when they go for groceries. Increasing numbers of parents are reporting being told to leave their children in the car or being verbally abused by other shoppers.This shows no empathy or understanding for single parents.

Experts at Dundee University Museum Collections were also involved.The result of their work is a huge online store offering the public free, unrestricted access to hundreds of models through the Sketchfab content-sharing .As well as the Carola, there are images of MV Spartan, the only surviving Scottish-built ldquopuffer, and RNLB Jane Anne, a rare surviving example of a double-ended, self-righting leboat which is hugely important to the Maritime Museumrsquos local community of Irvine.Staff at Dundee University, meanwhile, scanned specimens preserved in its globally famous zoological collection.Among the overseas items featured are the Smithsonianrsquos Apollo  Columbia command module, a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull from the Digital Atlas of Ancient Le and a fourth century BC sculpture held by the Minneapolis Institute of Art.Marta Pilarska, D Digitisation Project Manager at the Maritime Museum, said the models would create an entirely new relationship with members of the public.ldquoAll of a sudden ... we have this digital output that can serve not only as a condition-monitoring tool but is also visually appealing, she explained.ldquoWe can use it to engage with the public and allow online visitors to explore our collection in a new way. One of the benefits of this ndash particularlyyoursquore talking about vessels such as MV Spartan and SY Carola ndash is that while visiting the Museum in Irvine one can view the vessels from the outside, but access to interiors is restricted.ldquoImmersive virtual tours, based on -degree imaging, enabled us to make those areas accessible.However, the technical challenges were signicant.ldquoWersquove had to move quickly through a big but rewarding learning curve, said Ms Pilarska.ldquoD laser scanning and photogrammetry are the two main techniques used in digital recording of heritage sites and objects.\"Photogrammetry is the one used more often in the museum sector, as it is regarded as being easier and more budget-friendly. In short, it comes down to taking hundreds of images from all around the object and processing them in a software capable of recognising distinctive features of these objects and hellip digitally reconstructing the objectrsquos geometry. Based on that, the D model is built.\"Laser scanning, on the other hand, guarantees high accuracy and is considered a standard D surveying method.ldquoWhenever a laser beam sent from the scanner hits the surface of the object and s to the sensor, it is recorded as a precise measurement. Scanners send and record millions of such beams during data capture and all of them are stored as points in D space, or point clouds. Those point clouds are then what underpins the accurate D model.\"Ms Pilarska hopes the scans will become a huge online draw while the Maritime Museum itself is closed under coronavirus lockdown measures.But the project, she stressed, was not solely about boosting interaction with the public. Building up detailed information about the vessels themselves was another key aim.ldquoHaving an accurate record of the museum collection was one of two reasons to have this project happen, she said. ldquoPublic access is the second.ldquoCreating detailed documentation of museum collections has always been one of the fundamentals of curatorsrsquo work, and D documentation feels like the next step that the sector will take with advancements in technology.Over at Dundee University, Dr Caroline Erolin and her students scanned specimens from the world-famous DrsquoArcy Thompson Zoology Museum. Among the more unusual and exotic contributions are a sea turtle carapace, a pencil urchin and a rhinoceros hindfoot.For Ms Erolin, a senior lecturer in medical art, questions over how much of the universityrsquos collection would be posted touched on a growing debate around ensuring that public access to artefacts does not come at the expense of a proper appreciation of their origin.ldquoTherersquos a movement to say that everything should be totally open access and rights-free for the public, she said.ldquoThe counter argument is that objects can then be viewed and shared without anything about their cultural context, where they have come from.ldquoWe wanted to take part but not put the whole collection up online and make the entire thing open access.ldquoSo we put  objects online, totally open access, and around another  more under a lsquonon-commercial, attribution, share-alikersquo licence, although people like members of the general public can still download thosethey want to.ldquoWe will see how that goes and may make more open access in the future.Ms Erolin said the availability of the Sketchfab store felt particularly important as the coronavirus lockdown continues and Scots look for sources of mental stimulation at home.ldquoIt definitely has value terms of public outreach, she added.ldquoMatthew Jarron, the museum curator, was quite keen because [the museum] is campus-based and itrsquos not open to the public that often.ldquoWe thought it would be nice to have certain specimens more accessible on a permanent basis.ldquoMembers of the public can download the scanned images free, then D print them. So there are multiple aspects of it from a public engagement point of view.ldquoOf course, this was before coronavirus and so itrsquos timely to have that dferent means of access.ldquoEven when the museum is open, itrsquos maybe a bit harder for some people ndash the disabled, for example - to access it, so it just widens access in the general sense.It is also possible the store will continue growing.ldquoI donrsquot knowwe will realistically scan everything,\" she said. \"But perhaps, with an internship, we will have someone coming in and doing a few more scans and plan to keep building it up."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-six-o-wan-two-thirds-o-other","story":"EVY Poumpouras, a former American Secret Service agent, has published Becoming Bulletproof, a self-help manual about how to take on the worldhellip and win.

Wages boards are a thing of the past. More people are self-employed. More work for agencies or on zero-hour contracts. Many small businesses which would previously been sole traders or partnerships have, instead, become limited companies.A great deal of this change has been spurred on through Government encouragement. The inability of governments to respond to the changes that they have created in recent decades means that our politicians now need to be bold and creative in how we respond. If we fail to do so then we risk leaving behind many of the hardest-working and most productive people in our communities. We also risk making the task of rebuilding our economy harder than it needs to be.That is why on Monday I urged the Chancellor of the Exchequer to look seriously at the idea of a Universal Basic Income. His response was dismissive but the growing calls in support of the idea are not going to go away.Thousands of families will face financial hardship in this crisis due to the current gaps in Government support. The small building firm in Shetland that I have been trying to help in recent weeks illustrates the problem well. It is owned by the two men who started it and runs as a limited company. The owners take most of their income though idends. Their four employees have been furloughed and their position ought to be secure. As things stand, however, there is no adequate help for the two owners of the business. The purpose of the furlough scheme is to protect jobs now for when productive work restarts. Unless we find a way of helping these business owners, and thousands like them, there will be no business to which the employees can .A few weeks ago I may not have been quite as dismissive of a universal basic income as the Chancellor has proven but I would certainly have been sceptical of its merits. Like most Scots I was taught by my parents that hard work would win reward, which would allow me to get on in le and then to pay back. It is how I have tried to live my le and how I, in turn, have raised my children. The idea of money coming from the government to every citizen, with nothing expected in , sits ill with that approach to le. Then again, the idea that government can close businesses, stop social and sporting gatherings and curtail our civil liberties in a quite drastic manner sits no more easily. We have all had to accept the necessary price of fighting this war against Covid-. Yes, a universal basic income risks giving money to people who do not need it. That, however, is something that is easily remedied through the tax system. If you think about it, we already have a form of universal basic income in the state pension. Anyone receiving that who gets more from an occupational or personal pension pays income tax on anything above the tax threshold. This also offers us an opportunity to gather evidence on which to base our decisions about the future of our economy and our society when this is all over. Income inequality has grown in this country and now poses a risk to social cohesion. A Universal Basic Income may be part of the answer to that. I frankly remain to be convinced but I have an open mind and I would like to see the evidence. Sir Arthur Conan Doylersquos most famous creation, Sherlock Holmes, put it thus: ldquoWhen you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.Our Government may not like the truth with which they are faced but they offer no alternative.

He wants to manage it himself, but it seems unmanageable. Work arrives on dferent s ndash via email, Teams, website downloads ndash with assignments often not where you expect them to be.Reports into lockdown delivery of online education are revealing a staggering dference between inidual schools, and crucially between the state and private sector. Neil Mackay, writing in this paper last week, reported that a survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association before Easter found that less than half of children were engaging with teachers. He described how one teacher had told him she only had four children out of  join an online lesson. I recognise that. My son was one of three in such a low turn-out class and only because we happened to spot the message when it came in.And I understand why kids arenrsquot engaging. It feels to me asour childrenare being thrown in at the deep end and the swimming skills they have to learn are a form of digital self-management. Some may emerge at the end having learned practices of self-organisation, but many will not. Some, in some houses, have no access to digital learning at all. Irsquom not blaming the inidual teachers, many of whom are locked in a struggle of trying to deliver learning through new technology s, while also possibly juggling their own kids. I also think itrsquos wrong to blame parents. The wider system itself should deliver a lot better for all kids.I also, however, think that children are part of a wider world, and above all we need to be working out right now how to make this better for all of us in the new normal.The truth is Irsquom someone who believes in slowness. I take on board Danny Dorlingrsquos argument that evidence shows we are already going through a period of technological slowdown, economic deceleration and declining growth.But it feels aseven in this pause, le for many of us is only getting more digitally hectic.

However,strict lockdown rules are in place, there could be a question of whether even travelling from their Edinburgh home to Sunderland to collect their baby will be outlawed.ldquoEverything depends on what happens with the baby nearer the time, and whether it will have to be a hospital birth, added Chris. ldquoWe will deal with whatever the situation is. We are just looking forward to being parents.NHS trusts across the UK also have strict rules restricting scans, antenatal appointments and classes to just the pregnant woman, leading to concerns that intended parents are missing key moments and information related to their baby.Instead, Chris, , and Kevin, , are relying on videos filmed by their surrogate Linder which show their baby kicking and making recordings of themselves reading stories to be played to the growing baby so it becomes aware of their voices.ldquoThe key thing from day one has been that Linder is healthy and the baby is healthy, added Kevin. ldquoMissing the -week scan was disheartening and we were sad, but also ecstatic. We are just trying to crack on.Under normal circumstances, maternity wards allow intended parents to spend time in hospital after the birth enabling the surrogate ndash although legally the infantrsquos mother ndash to have no role in its care.However, there are fears surrogate mothers may now feel pressured to take over caring responsibilities such as feeding, bathing and nappy changes, and to make decisions over the babyrsquos care while waiting to be discharged.Linder, who has previously delivered surrogate babies to two other couples, said: ldquoI understand the reasons for restrictions, but there is a need to make an exception.ldquoThe baby will have two parents who are willing to look after it. I have no biological link with the baby and Irsquom not prepared to provide care for the baby ongoing, because itrsquos not right for me to do that.She added: ldquoIrsquove heard of surrogates having to look after the baby until they are discharged. Irsquove also heard of hospitals allowing the surrogate to be discharged while a parent goes in to look after the baby until it is ready to leave, which is much better. Itrsquos really important that Chris and Kevin can be there and have those first moments with their baby.There are also concerns that the legal processes which pass on full parental rights may be delayed due to Covid-, potentially leaving families in limbo for months.Olivia Rowlands, , whose womb was damaged by bowel cancer treatment which also sparked early menopause, and husband Sam, , from St Andrews, have also had their hopes of attending their babyrsquos birth thrown into confusion.Ellie Hutchinson, , from Stirling, Oliviarsquos cousin, is due to give birth to the couplersquos daughter by planned caesarean section in July.Olivia said: ldquoWe really donrsquot know what will happen during the birth.ldquoWe had hoped we could both be there ndash I canrsquot imagine not being able to see Samrsquos face when our baby is born.

It was the nobles and rich speculators, who had gambled and lost in the mad venture, who were hustling it through on the promise of a better time, mainly for themselves as they were to receive more than half of their losses ed.The Edinburgh parliament represented Scottish opinion only in a theoretical sense, made up as it was of self-perpetuating noblemen and landowners, but this was true of all parliaments wherever they existed. By the eve of the Union there were  parliamentarians, some  hereditary peers,  \"shire\" or county commissioners, and  burgh commissioners.The rough head count at the time reckoned that the majority of the parliament would be agin the deal, which is where blatant bribery was employed to buy votes and pay spies and agents provocateurs, pound, sterlingof which was distributed by the Earl of Glasgow.As Robert Burns famously put it, ldquoSuch a parcel of rogues in a nation they were ldquobought and sold for English gold.By then, the Scottish and English thrones had been united under one monarch for more than  years, since the Union of the Crowns in , when James Vl also became king of England when Queen Elizabeth died childless.James was Mary, Queen of Scots son, although he hadnrsquot seen her since he was an infant. The doomed Mary, taking advantage of May Day, wassailing and general drunkenness in Lochleven Castle where she was being held a prisoner in , managed to escape and head south. She was heedless of her advisers telling her not to go to London and she ended up, of course, heidless.May , eight years earlier, had seen theof John Knox from exile to lead the Scottish Reformation. And as Gandhi would probably have said had he been around to be asked: ldquoI think that would be a good idea.Knox believed that having a woman ruler ndash as he blasted in his famous tract The First Blast of the Trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women ndash was a violation of the natural order. Following Maryrsquos escape from Lochleven he joined the chorus condemning Mary as an adulteress and murderess and for the rest of his le spoke of her as ldquothat wicked woman.May  in  was also the day the King James Version of the Bible was published in London.There have been monsters throughout Scottish history, usually of the two-legged kind. On May  in  while one of most evil in history was starting a reign of terror on his people by first taking over German trade unions, here we were looking to the north of the country and Loch Ness, not to Hitler, and the legend of the serpentine monster began.There may have been local mutterings and sightings before but when the Inverness Courier ran a story about a large ldquobeast or ldquowhale-like fish it was christened Nessie. The writer was Alex Campbell, a water bailf on the loch and part-time journalist, and the article covered an alleged sighting by Aldie Mackay of an enormous creature writhing about the water as she and her husband drove along the shore.In Campbellrsquos words, ldquoThe creature disported itself, rolling and plunging for fully a minute, its body resembling that of a whale, and the water cascading and churning like a simmering cauldron. Soon, however, it disappeared in a boiling mass of foam.Not for long, however, because it was to reappear with regularity in the years that followed, to be photographed ndash although some of the shots were hoaxes or genuine misinterpretations of innocent logs and waves ndash and see surveys and expeditions camp on the shore for months, and to be written about until this day.The latest \"sighting\" was in  when Apple Maps showed a satellite image of what appeared to be a -metre-long monster, although it might just have been the wake of a boat, ripples caused by seals or floating wood.On that same day in , a monster capable of both destroying the world and powering it opened in southwest Scotland. It was the Chapelcross nuclear station on a former Second World War airfield near Annan, commissioned to produce weapons-grade plutonium for the UKrsquos weapons programme and also to generate power for the National Grid.The plant was decommissioned in  but the final demolition and site clearance wonrsquot be complete until at least , but more likely the new century. Hope yoursquore around for that.On May  in , the first Hillman Imp rolled off the production line at the new Rootes factory at Linwood. It was meant to compete with the highly-successful Mini, but it was hastily designed and badly executed. It was rear-engined and handled badly ndash some customers placed a bag of cement under the front bonnet to keep it stable ndash and it had an inadequate cooling system, gearbox and clutch problems, faulty chokes and a tendency to leak water. No surprise the Imp developed a reputation for unreliability.It wasnrsquot all bad as it provided work in an industry-ravaged area although that was not to last and, in , the company donated  Imps, painted green and white, for Celtic fans to drive to Lisbon to watch their team lt the European Cup.After  years it was over ndash ldquoLinwood no more as the Proclaimers sang in Letter From America ndash when Chrysler, which had taken over from Rootes, closed the factory and, in its words, put an end to that ldquodamned poorly-designed automobile. And damned the , or so who were directly or indirectly employed by the company to the dole queue.Another carmaker, Henry Ford, said that history is bunk.

In many city suburbs and country villages, the racket is relentless.

Failure to observe this restriction will result in one day of imprisonment for every minute of racket.Before coming to my second democratic authoritarian measure, on a related horticultural matter Irsquom also advocating that people with gardens who donrsquot appreciate them, except as racket-zones, should be moved into flats.Similarly, many country people should be relocated to urban council housing schemes, where theyrsquoll be happier among their own sort, listening to rap and making a hullabaloo.My second measure involves the confiscation and destruction of any time piece costing more than pound.

Its main purpose is to evaluate the situation for journalists in  countries and territories across the globe.In this regard therersquos no doubt the index has become an extremely useful advocacy tool in helping promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and in defending media workers rights.But vital as such a role is, this serves as little consolation to the fact that the conclusions drawn by the index these past few years have been far from heartening. The current index is no exception, or then again perhaps it is, for rarely in recent times has it portrayed a bleaker picture of the threats facing media freedom worldwide.Those threats, of course, have inevitably been amplied by the coronavirus pandemic, as existing and aspiring autocrats around the world crack down on journalistsrsquo ability to do their jobs at a time when transparency is more vital than ever.In fact, so pressing are those threats that RSF has warned that the next  years will pretty much determine the fate of journalism as we know it. ldquoWe are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future, says RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire. ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor, Deloire added in his recent summation of the current index ratings.Questioning what all this means for freedom of information, pluralism and reliability by , Deloire maintains the answer to that is already being determined and as we move through this ldquodecisive decade, five converging crises are having a malign influence and potentially devastating impact on international journalism.The first of these is what RSF says is a ldquogeopolitical crisis due to aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes, which coronavirus has already starkly highlighted.The second is a ldquotechnological crisis resulting from the lack of appropriate regulation of digitalised communication, creating a kind of ldquoinformation chaos blurring the lines between fact, fiction, propaganda and advertising, often putting them in direct competition with mainstream bona fide journalism.The third crisis in this perfect storm facing journalism highlighted by RSF is a growing physical hostility towards journalists globally.Much of this hostility, it concludes, is an offshoot of the hatred towards the press fomented by some political leaders such as US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.ldquoHostility toward journalists and news outlets in the US deepened and intensied, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president, the media watchdog concluded.ldquoThe abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in , as journalists covering the Trump administrationrsquos response to the crisis are subjected to the presidentrsquos attacks during his press briefings, it added.According to the index ratings, the US now ranks th out of  countries. A ldquodangerous anti-press sentiment as well as the arrest, physical assault, public denigration and harassment of journalists had trickled down to the local level in America, the report determined.Related to this open hostility and the last of the five elements in the crises press freedom faces is one of trust, says RSF. Or put another way the public suspects broadcast and print news to have been contaminated by unreliable information.In making its case for this, the media watchdog cites a recent Edelman Trust Barometer conducted by the US-based public relations group that studies public trust in institutions.According to those polled in Edelmanrsquos latest international survey, % of people believed the media they used were contaminated with information they thought untrustworthy. That in itself, most would admit, is cause for serious concern, but combined with the other threats outlined, all five converge into one enormous challenge to the worldwide press of the future.Itrsquos a sobering thought not least today, May , as we mark World Press Freedom Day along with its theme this year of ldquojournalism without fear or favour.In order to understand in real terms just what these threats mean to journalismrsquos future, itrsquos worth drilling down a little deeper into their implications.The obvious place to start is with the impact of the pandemic itself. Having said that, long before the emergence of coronavirus, world press freedoms were recognised as being in decline.For many years journalists have weathered authoritarian regimes and threats to their safety. But where most observers are now in near total agreement is that the pandemic has brought a new dynamic to the media landscape exposing the long-term risks of suppressed press freedomsAs Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalistspoints out, those countries that stle independent news and jail journalists in ldquonormal times have already been hard at work.In what some journalists have called the global ldquoCovid crackdown, China and Iran, th and rd respectively in the Press Freedom Index, tried to quarantine the truth. In Iranrsquos case the leadership there censored news of its spread with devastating consequences for public health.Many media monitoring groups are now concerned that, for the most part, governments have been getting away with their efforts to impede independent journalism without being called out by other countries, all of which are also preoccupied in dealing with the pandemic.ldquoGovernments in Thailand, through Hungary and Egypt to Honduras, are using the cloud cover of the diseases to introduce emergency measures that could roll back basic freedoms, clamp down on the press, or restrict foreign correspondents, warned Mahoney of the CPJ recently on Al azeera.At its worst this manests itself in arrests, detention, intimidation, physical threats and sometimes murder.In terms of Covid--related reporting, human rights group Amnesty International last week highlighted a handful of cases where reporters have been prosecuted or threatened. Among them was that of Russian journalist Elena Milashina whose newspaper Novaya Gazeta on April blished an article in which she criticised the Chechen authoritiesrsquo response to the pandemic.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in turn posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Serviceto ldquostop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people. In Egypt, meanwhile, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper on March , and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenged the official statistics on Covid- cases.In Venezuela, it was journalist Darvinson Rojas who spent  days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources.These are only three of many instances globally where reporting on the pandemic brought journalists under threat, but itrsquos not only during the current crisis that such measures have been documentedLast year,  serious threats to press freedom were recorded, including  physical attacks on journalists. A total of  cases of intimidation and direct threat have been listed in a report compiled by several media organisations, among them RSF, the Association of European Journalists and the International Press Institute.Late last year, too,  journalists were imprisoned for their work, primarily in Turkey, Russia, and Azerbaijan.As Otmar Lahodynsky, president of the Association of European Journalistswrote recently in the EU affairs newspaper NewEurope, the takeover of media by oligarchs and governments in Hungary, Poland, and Serbia were also noted and criticised in the report.ldquoMany public-service broadcasters have been turned into uncritical propaganda channels for the government. Abuses of media freedom are also increasing in Western Europe, says Lahodynsky, adding that political influence on the media is increasing in many of the  countries that count themselves as members of the Council of Europe.But beyond these obvious threats to journalism and its future lie others, many economic, with job cuts gutting newsrooms. As RSF makes clear, the digital transformation has brought the media to their knees in many countries.Falling sales, the collapse in advertising revenue and the increase in production and distribution costs have in turn forced news organisations to restructure and lay off journalists.ldquoThe economic crisis has also accentuated the phenomena of ownership concentration and, even more, conflicts of interest, which threaten journalistic pluralism and independence, warns the watchdog.The bottom line here is that global journalism currently faces both old threats and new, raising the inevitable question of how best to protect and nurture its existence in the ldquodecisive decade that lies ahead.According to Farhana Haque Rahman, senior vice-president of the global news agency Inter Press Service, ultimately, just as in a pandemic, the freedom of the press can only be guaranteed by a co-ordinated global effort and a focus on highlighting the long-term advantages of a more critical world.ldquoThis means pressure to reinforce legal frameworks, including prosecuting harassers and killers, perhaps just as the international community would persecute war criminals, while offering a global protection for journalists, says Rahman.ldquoFinding and promoting innovative ways of subsidising independent media, as well as getting big tech companies to pay for the content they share, is also crucial to help a free press to thrive, she says.Just as the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a marathon not a sprint, so must the long-term future of journalism be viewed in the same terms.Ever since the United Nations proclaimed World Press Freedom Day on this date back in , the obstacles facing independent reporting have consistently been immense.Censorship, smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention, threats of physical assault and murder are the challenges journalists across many parts of the world have had to contend with.These are unprecedented times and, as one colleague recently observed, no working journalist alive has ever covered anything like this story of the pandemic. Even veterans of war reporting or Ebola coverage have had to re-evaluate risk and learn new skills.As we mark World Press Freedom Day itrsquos obvious that many challenges beyond the current one lie in wait. Most likely these will put the very heart of journalistic practice and the ability to carry it out without fear or favour to an unprecedented test.To say we need journalism now more than ever is true. But it also masks a reality worth reiterating, one that makes clear the importance of having a free press each and every day, whether the story is of global or local concern.In either instance, holding power to account and performing a public interest role is fundamental to this. But just as the press holds the powers at be to account, so too do we need reasoned critical consumers of the media, those similarly capable of holding the media to task for any misrepresentations of the truth.It was the great French author and journalist Albert Camus who once observed that: ldquoA free press can of course, be good or bad, but most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.If, as the World Press Freedom report suggests, the next  years prove to be an unprecedented test for the media, then good journalism will need all the allies it can muster.As RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire, rightly pointed out: ldquoFor this decisive decade to not be a disastrous one, people of goodwill, whoever they are, must campaign for journalists to be able to fulfil their role as societyrsquos trusted third parties, which means they must have the capacity to do so.Speaking as someone with a vested interest in that happening, I can only say how welcome that trust would be. But equally, however, those within my profession must realise that in order for that to take place, we too must prove ourselves worthy of that same trust."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-begin-post-brexit-trade-deal-talks-us-week","story":"The government is looking to strike an ambitious relationship, which will open up new opportunities to businesses in Britain.International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will launch the negotiations via video conference call because of the Covid- crisis.Around  negotiators on each side will take part in the talks, the first round of which are set to last for a fortnight.Further rounds will take place roughly every six weeks, and will continue to be carried out remotely until it is safe to travel.:Refusal to extend Brexit transition period raises chilling prospect of no-deal, warns Ian BlackfordMs Truss said: ldquoThe US is our largest trading partner and increasing transatlantic trade can help our economies bounce back from the economic challenge posed by coronavirus.ldquoWe want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.ldquoAs we sit down at the negotiating table early next week, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits iniduals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK.Talks will be led on the UK side by UK-US chief negotiator Oliver Grfiths, while all UK trade negotiations are being overseen by the Department for International Tradersquos chief trade negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer.It comes after the UK blamed Brussels for having made ldquolimited progress during the second round of negotiations on a future trade deal between the European Union and UK.Negotiators have warned their counterparts across the Channel that Britain will ldquonot subordinate its laws to the EU ldquoin any areas and called for more flexibility from the bloc in order to strike a deal.The EUrsquos negotiation mandate stated that the UK must sign up to some Brussels-set regulations to prevent the bloc being undercut on standards once the transition period ends in December.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, last month accused the UK of refusing to commit ldquoseriously on numerous fundamental points during the talks, which took place via video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic.:Doug Marr: There is an answer to this virus but Brexit is not itShadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said: ldquoWith the US election now just six months away, we should all be extremely wary of a president who will do anything to stay in the White House, and a Conservative Government that will do anything to help him.ldquoThat is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workersrsquo rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS.ldquoIf Boris Johnson will not stand up to Donald Trump, then the British Parliament must.

MacDonnell was commissioned a captain.In spring  MacDonnell was sent back to Scotland to meet Jacobite chiefs. He was eventually captured, though, and sent to the Tower of London. Not long afterwards his brother was killed after the Battle of Falkirk.He was recruited as a double agent by Henry Pelham, then British Prime Minister. Released under the  Act of Indemnity, he was soon working as the infamous spy codenamed Pickle. Information from MacDonnell helped secure the arrest and execution of the Jacobite leader Archibald Cameron, who had escaped into exile after Culloden.MacDonnell is thought to have pocketed the infamous treasure of Loch Arkaig, otherwise known as the Jacobitersquos Lost Gold. During the  rebellion, over a million French and Spanish gold coins were shipped to Scotland to assist the Jacobites. In the confusion of war, it ldquovanished and Archibald Cameron was dispatched to Scotland in  to find the money.His other mission was the assassination of George II. While on the hunt for the missing gold, double agent Pickle betrayed him, and Cameron was hanged, drawn and quartered. Legend has it that MacDonnell claimed the missing loot and drted into retirement.The Scot whofought the SovietsROBERT Bruce Lockhart was a typical Scottish son of the Empire. Born into a prosperous Fe family of teachers, he waseducated at Fettes College and then left for Malaya to run rubber plantations. His taste for adventure was soon plain. He ran off with ldquothe beautul ward of a Malay prince, but later caught malaria and had to recuperate back in Britain.He joined the Foreign Service and was posted to Moscow. A talented footballer, he joined a local team which won the Moscow League championship in . Come the  Revolution, Lockhart was British Consul General, eventually becoming the UKrsquos first envoy to the Bolsheviks.He was now sleeping with the we of a Russian count, who was also a suspected Soviet agent, and working for British intelligence. He was given pound million in diamonds to fund a Russian agent network. In , Lockhart and Sidney Reilly ndash aka The Ace of Spies ndash were accused of plotting to assassinate Lenin. Later, he was confined in the Kremlin as a prisoner but escaped trial in a spy swap. The Soviets later sentenced him to death in absentia.His autobiography Memoirs Of A British Agent became the  Hollywood movie British Agent, starring Leslie Howard. During the Second World War he co-ordinated all British propaganda against Nazi Germany. His son, Robin Bruce Lockhart, wrote the book Ace Of Spies which became a TV series starring Sam Neill in the s. He died in  after struggling with alcoholism most of his le.Oor ain Jane BondSCOTLAND had its own female version of Indiana Jones working as a spy ndash Lorraine Adie Copeland, half archaeologist, half Jane Bond hellip and her son turned out to be Stewart Copeland, drummer in the band The Police.Born in Scotland in , Copeland came from a wealthy family ndash her father was a neurosurgeon with offices in Londonrsquos Harley Street.Highly intelligent and well educated, during the Second World War she was recruited by the Special Operations Executive. SOE ran espionage and sabotage missions in occupied Europe. She met her husband at this time, the famed American spy Miles Copeland, described as charming and charismatic.The pair married in  and Copeland was soon involved in espionage in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. It was while she was in the middle east that she began studying archaeology, eventually becoming a world expert on the Stone Age.Friends remember her as highly outspoken. The couple were friends with Kim Philby, Britainrsquos most notorious double agent, a member of the Cambridge spy ring who worked for the KGB while a senior MI officer. In Beirut, the Copeland home ndash the site of many glamorous parties ndash was known as ldquoThe CIA House.What better couple to work as international spies ndash a beautul, intelligent Scot, and a handsome, dashing American.They could have been characters in an Ian Fleming novel. She died in  at her French home, taking her secrets to the grave.Scotlandrsquos spy for Imperial JapanNOT all of Scotlandrsquos spies are charming rogues or brilliant beauties, some are just sleazy traitors. Step forward William Forbes-Sempill, the th Lord Sempill. Born at Craigie Castle in Aberdeenshire, he was educated at Eton before joining the Royal Flying Corps at the outbreak of the First World War. He was one of the most successfulairmen of the conflict.However, his fame and glamour were a cover for something much darker. In , he led a British mission to Japan to help develop its airforce. However, when the Anglo-Japanese Alliance ended in , Sempill should have cut all military contact with Tokyo.He didnrsquot. He began passing classied information in exchange for money. When MI tapped his phone, they discovered his manservant was a Japanese sailor.There was a risk thatSempill was interrogated, Tokyo might work out that Britain had cracked Japanese codes. It was decided it wasnrsquot in Britainrsquos best interests to prosecute him.However, itrsquos also pretty clear his position played a big part in saving his skin ndash his father was aide-de-camp to King George V. Unbelievably, Sempill went on to work at the Admiralty, with access to secret information.By , it was clear that Sempill was also pro-Hitler ndash and still spying for the Japanese. Churchill believed that when details of his own personal movements were intercepted on their way from the Japanese Embassy to the Tokyo Foreign Ministry, Sempill was involved.By autumn , Churchill proposed getting rid of Sempill by offering ldquohim a post in the north of Scotland. However, come Pearl Harbour in December , Sempillrsquos offices were raided and secret documents uncovered which shouldnrsquot have been in his possession.It was clear evidence of treason, but again no prosecution followed. Sempill agreed to retire from public office and died in .SPYLANDIT isnrsquot just people who have made their mark on the art of spying when it comes to Scotland ndash itrsquos the landscape itself, ideally suited to training spooks, saboteurs and assassins.Special Operations Executiveused Scotlandrsquos wild Highland terrain to train agents during the war. SOE had around  camps in secluded locations across the country. One site, in Inverlair in Inverness-shire, known as ldquoThe Cooler, was used to house agents who had either failed training or been recalled from duty.The Cooler was meant to provide time to decompress, and to ensure anyone unstable didnrsquot leak sensitive information.The north of Scotland was also useful for infiltrating Nazi spies due to its remote coastline. One of Hitlerrsquos top agents, Vera Eriksen ndash the German Mata Hari ndash was snared at a Buckie railway station.She had landed by boat nearby. Eriksen was found, along with fellow agent Karl Drucke, with a kne, pistol, money, a radio and a list of RAF bases. Another pair of Nazi spies was caught in Scotland because they were cycling on the wrong side of the road.SOE used Arisaig House for Commando training Glasnacardoch Lodge at Mallaig was a weapons cache and firing range Drumintoul Lodge in Aviemore and Glenmore Lodge in Inverness-shire were used for training commandos to fight in occupied Norway Achnacarry Castle was a general commando training facility and Belhaven School, Dunbar was used to train wireless operators behind enemy lines.Unsurprisingly, then, the SAS was founded by a Scot ndash David Stirling, who was born in Lecropt, Perthshire in  into a wealthy, well-connected military family.He studied at Cambridge and dreamed of becoming an artist in Paris. At over six feet, he was training to climb Everest when the Second World War broke out.Commissioned into the Scots Guards, he then volunteered as a commando in the unit known as Force Z.He eventually persuaded top brass to allow him to set up an experimental special operations outfit designed to operate behind enemy lines. Stirlingrsquos right-hand man was Jock Lewes, the SASrsquos principal training officer and inventor of the Lewes Bomb.Stirling led from the front. His men would drive through German aircraft bases in North Africa shooting up planes and setting off explosives. In one raid, they took out  aircraft, mostly bombers, with just one man lost.Stirling, who was dubbed ldquoThe Phantom Major by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, was captured by the Germans in . He escaped, was recaptured and sent to Colditz. Field Marshall Montgomery described Stirling as ldquomad, quite mad, but believed men like him essential to winning the war.After the war, Stirling set up a mercenary outfit. He was linked to a failed coup against Libyarsquos Colonel Gaddafi. He later established an organisation called Great Britain  ndash made up of aristocrats and ex-soldiers ndash who planned to take over the running of the UK in the event of civil unrest and government collapse. Stirling also worked to undermine trade unionism.The flawed father of British special forces died in .SPOOK CULTUREITrsquoS little wonder then that the current series of SAS: Who Dares Wins finds a natural home in Scotland. Itrsquos filmed on Raasay. In its latest bizarre outing, celebrities like Katie Price and Joey Essex are put through special forces training while being humiliated by retired SAS operatives.Of course, therersquos a slightly more upmarket side to Scotlandrsquos spooks on film and in literature. Without Scotland, the spy genre would be a shadow of itself. Richard Hannay is the prototype fictional spy hero.A creation of the Scottish author John Buchan, Hannay made his first appearance in the  thriller The Thirty-Nine Steps about German spies operating in Britain in the run-up to the outbreak of the First World War.The plot mirrored real attempts by the Kaiser to use spies in Scotland to gather naval intelligence. Hannay, who is also Scots, appeared in six more novels, and is based on Edinburghrsquos Edmund Ironside, a spy during the Boer War.He was later prosecuted in  under the Official Secrets Act for his wartime autobiography Greek Memories. He pleaded guilty to avoid trial and prison. The book revealed that UK embassies were used as spy cover, named the section of British intelligence which we now know as MI, and revealed that the head of MI was known as C.Of course, C is the inspiration for the fictional spymaster M in the James Bond novels. Not only was Bond played most memorably by Sean Connery, but  is also a Scot. In the novels, Bondrsquos father is Andrew Bond from Glencoe. After a brief stint at Eton, Bond gets expelled ndash for hanky-panky with a maid, of course ndash and completes his education at Fettes.There are echoes of Bond in the le of his creator, Ian Fleming. Fleming had a Scottish father ndash Valentine, a Tory MP from Newport-on-Tay in Fe. Flemingrsquos grandfather was the Scottish financier Robert Fleming.And, of course, in a neat full circle, the latest Bond movies shot some of their most iconic scenes in Scotland, with Skyfall filmed around Glen Coe and Glen Etive. The upcoming Bond movie No Time To Die also features stunning action sequences shot around Badenoch.So, the long and strange love affair between Scotland and spies continues into the future."},{"url":null,"title":"kim-jong-un-not-undergo-surgery-south-korean-officials-claim","story":"North Korea had said on Saturday that Mr Kim attended the completion of a fertiliser factory near Pyongyang on Friday, in his first public appearance in about  days.While his re-emergence, captured on video footage released by North Korean state media, quelled intense rumours that he might be gravely ill or even have died, some media outlets and observers still raised questions about his health, citing moments when his walking looked a bit stf at the factory.A senior South Korean presidential official told reporters on Sunday that the government has determined that Mr Kim did not have surgery or any other procedure, according to the presidential Blue House.When rumours about Mr Kimrsquos health surfaced in recent weeks, the South Korean government steadfastly dismissed them as baseless and maintained there were no unusual activities in the North.It is not the first time Mr Kim has disappeared from public view for an extended period.In , when he reappeared after a six-week absence, he walked with a cane and used an electric cart.The North Korea-provided footage on Saturday showed the -year-old riding an electric cart similar to the one he used in , when he was reported to have an ankle injury.In , Mr Kim entered talks with President Donald Trump on the fate of his nuclear arsenal, but their diplomacy has been deadlocked in recent months.Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday that ldquoI, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!"},{"url":null,"title":"eurostar-says-passengers-must-wear-face-masks","story":"In a tweet in French and in English, the international high-speed train service says the policy will apply to both its trains and its stations, ldquoin line with guidelines announced by the French and Belgian governments.It warned passengers without a mask could be refused travel.Important update: From  May, passengers must wear a face mask or face covering in our stations and on board, in line with guidelines from the French and Belgian governments.

The Scottish and UK governments have already made it clear they see no major change to the current rules, so you may wonder what room there is for speculation. Acres and acres of it is the answer. With very little  on the news agenda other than coronavirus all those broadcasting hours must be filled somehow.The Sunday papers helped with the speculation game by sending lots of hares running about what le might be like once restrictions are lted. For a start, there are likely to be lots more queues, this time to get on a bus or train.As it turned out, the Minister for the Sunday shows was Grant Shapps, UK Transport Secretary and a man best placed to talk about such matters. Or so you might think.There are certain rules in the speculation game to which all players must adhere. On journalistsrsquo part this involves beginning a question by saying you donrsquot expect AN Other minister to give a precise answer, then asking them to do just that. A questioner might say, for example. ldquoI know you canrsquot tell usschools are going to be back in June, but are schools going to be back in June Since there is only so much of this a viewer can tolerate, the Sunday shows broadened their offerings by talking to a wider range of guests than in previous weeks.The Andrew Marr Show has always dipped its toes in the arts as well as politics, and yesterday the presenter spoke to former Python turned world traveller Michael Palin, and the actor Eddie Marsan, about le during lockdown.Michael Palin is among the contributors to a new book, Dear NHS. Adam Kay, author of This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, had the idea of asking famous names to write a letter of thanks to the NHS, with money from sales going to charity.The former Python said being in lockdown felt like ldquoenforced retirement and he was rather enjoying having an empty diary.Marr asked how travel might change for everyone in a post-virus world.ldquoYou can travel less and travel better, said Palin. ldquoIf we have to be confined to travelling the UK it is not a bad place to travel. Go to places and learn more about them, enjoy them more. Find out more about your own country.ldquoIt is going to be very dficult for people right across the world to travel again as they did before. Until they find a vaccine nobody is going to pack people into aeroplanes. Therersquos going to be no cheap and cheerful flights around the world.Palin was also asked about the possibility of people over  being told to stay in lockdown longer than younger groups.ldquoItrsquos a dficult call every time but yoursquove got to be more selective here, because there are a great deal, a great number, of people in their s who are very active, very thoughtful, whorsquove got lots of ideas, can contribute to our recovery.ldquoTo treat them all as people who have to be sort of kept out of sight is going to be very dficult and very wrong and very unfair on a lot of people who want to help.On Ridge on Sunday, Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, was similarly critical of ldquoage discrimination against the over s.ldquoItrsquos not OK to discriminate on grounds of gender, or obesity, or colour of skin, but everybody is saying, letrsquos think about somehow discriminating on the basis of age, she said.ldquoThis idea that just because someone is old that they are frail, theyrsquore vulnerable, they are not fit or they are not worthy of the same treatment as other age groups is utterly wrong.The travel industry is not the only business going through major changes, as Marrrsquos interview with actor Eddie Marsan showed.The star of Happy-Go-Lucky and  Grams can be seen on television later this week in one of ITVrsquos ldquoIsolation Stories, a series of short, -minute dramas filmed in actorsrsquo own homes by their families.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains.

What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels.

Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea. Just another Red-Necked, Republican, USA idea.Ian,I value your opinions, some of which I agree with, some I don#t.What I don#t value is your judgemental uttering based on your opinions.Wikipedia # #Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States#Alaska is just a tad north on the Southern states and not all Republicans are white.NB , Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but NOT EXCLUSIVELY applied to white Americans of the Southern States. Sarah Palin, ninth governor of Alaska. Now there is a Redneckever there was one! Alaska is strongly Republican.In response to John Tulloch#s feelgood posturing on Wir Shetlandhaving #looked at# a Universal Basic Income, lets remember this: plenty comparably despicable groups have flirted with all sorts of policies the better to draw folk in.It makes the basic instinct informing Wir Shetlandand John Tulloch#s general political outlook no less reptilian.John derided Great Thunberg at the same time as a global alt-right campaign was launched against her. He is informed by some really unpleasant ideas.He has recently focused on China to distract attention away from the awful mess that has been Boris#s response to Covid .John Tulloch might want to whitewash his objectionable politics by aligning himself to a Universal Basic Income, but his whitewash reeks of hogwash because it is.Wow!

Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3098832.jpg--.jpg?1588153113000\n","title":"check your meter advises consumer council","story":"The Consumer Council is advising households and small businesses to ensure their energy bills are accurate and as low as possible during the COVID- lockdown.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam Tunney tells the story of the Kilrea man who swapped the cleaver for the canvas and never looked back. Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at.

What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement.

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine.

In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Not.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognised that one right away.Sandra Chapman column : JPIMedia \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I like to think that family le in the wider sense in Northern Ireland is treasured. Being of the baby boomer generation I do remember – just about – those years after the World War Two when my mother’s greatest treasure was her ration books or a visit from a spinster aunt who brought the treats we couldn’t otherwise afford. My aunt, , may have longed for a family of her own but we never knew or asked why she hadn’t married. I wish she was around today because her attention to us taught me, even though I was very young, the value of close family connections and the fact that our parents weren’t the only ones who loved us.I have several nephews and nieces now and I’ve tried to be a caring aunt, but it’s been dficult since I was a full time working mum and had to concentrate on my own children whilst not at work. By the time my children had taken up careers in other countries I tried to concentrate on the nephews and nieces but time was still always against me and they too were scattered to the winds.I have had to wait to what I call my ageing period to make any inroads into my relationships with them and being able to see them even only occasionally is a pleasure. But not now, with this lockdown thwarting me all the way. Family visits are out of the question as my sister reminded me in the early lockdown days when I was sure the odd visit wouldn’t matter. I’ve been fully in lockdown now for what seems an age.I’m certain that is what has revived my old back pain, my occasional bouts of insomnia and has left me looking much older than I should. Definitely. You see it’s not entirely family I’m missing - it’s the hairdresser, the chiropodist, the dentist, the dog groomer , my friends who live near and far, going to the shops and the prospect of not being able to pay a visit to my children and grandchildren - all of whom live in Europe. Boat or plane, it doesn’t matter, neither is available to take me there and equally they can’t come here. I think loneliness may be setting in.Himself is showing signs of impatience – that’s not how I describe myself – because, at this time of year, he would be preparing his boat for the summer sailing season. It sits, alongside a few dozen other boats, wonderingit will get it’s bottom scrubbed and anti-fouled this year before being released into the water amidst cheers of ship-ahoy and back slapping from the launching team.Being deprived of this ritual as, at the time of writing, marinas and harbours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland - north and south, are closed, is seriously bad for the old-salts brigade. All they can do is look out to sea and pray.We are well warned not to rush out of lockdown but a surprising number of people have run out of patience – not my generation I’m certain – with a sense of entitlement that puts everyone  at risk.One newspaper headline this week declared that ‘lockdown for a year would be a crippling economic blow’. The experts tell us it could cause a second ‘large and deadly peak’. Not attractive choices at all. We can do without those scenarios.Maybe it’s lethargy setting in, but I haven’t got round to ordering food on line as I’m happy enough with our corner shop, I’ll have to leave my hair to grow in its own unwieldly fashion and I don’t intend to fall out with the dog over grooming. The gypsy look will have to do.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Amid myriad allegations against the DUP and evidence that huge sums were being paid to many claimants, the then DUP minister Simon Hamilton rushed through temporary cuts to the subsidy. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Those January  regulations were immediately taken to court by boiler owners. In autumn  they lost their challenge in the High Court and, more than two years later, their appeal has still not been heard.In the meantime and during the three-year governance vacuum at Stormont, civil servants in the Department for the Economywere left to find a long-term solution.They decided on far deeper cuts than Mr Hamilton, eviscerating what had once been ‘cash for ash’ and making it far less generous than comparable schemes in GB and the Republic.Unsurprisingly, few members of the public were outraged that what had once been an uncapped scheme paying a notional £, a year to the few people running their boilers around the clock had been cut to a maximum of £, by Mr Hamilton and now chopped down to £, – a % drop.But by this stage the stories of genuine claimants who had entered the scheme in good faith at the urging of Stormont had become too loud to be ignored entirely.As the hapless Secretary of State Karen Bradley – who had agreed to rush Stormont civil servants’ changes to the scheme through Westminster – brought the proposals before Parliament, there were awkward questions from MPs and peers.By then it was clear that this was not an attempt to address what had once been a huge overspend – instead, the cuts were so deep that they led to a massive underspend of the money available from the Treasury.Officials insisted that their hands were tied by EU State Aid rules and anything more generous would be illegal under EU law. Yet they had no coherent explanation as to why schemes in other parts of Europe remain jaw-droppingly more lucrative than what they claim is the absolute maximum subsidy.In a concession to the House of Lords, officials agreed thatWestminster would pass their cuts then they would bring in an independent figure to examinetheir actions had unfairly left claimants in financial distress.The man assigned that task was Andrew Buglass, an energy expert from England. For reasons which remain unclear, his report was only published on Wednesday – five months late.Its  pages of findings will have made deeply uncomfortable reading for DfE’s energy ision. Mr Buglass set out multiple examples of how their actions had led to iniduals – who entered the scheme at Stormont’s urging – not only failing to receive any real incentive, but instead suffering signicant hardship.At the heart of the problem is that civil servants and – infamously – the then minister Arlene Foster had given cast iron guarantees that the subsidy rate was unalterable for  years.On the back of those firmest of guarantees, huge loans were taken out to finance the installation of boilers. Many claimants remain deeply in debt – but suddenly found that the supposedly guaranteed income which would repay those loans had evaporated.Mr Buglass found that one claimant had liquidated their pension fund to keep the bank from the door, another had sold a home, another had sold land, others had taken out overdrafts to keep up their repayments – and there has also been a signicant impact on mental health.He said he had been told of “knock-on effects in relationships and families, with recriminations among family members or heated disagreements on what action should be taken as a result” and one man said that “his children had faced bullying in school” as a result of him being a claimant.The evidence which he has collated tallies with that which this newspaper has been reporting for two and a half years.Unquestionably, some of those who entered the scheme were chancers and there is prima facie evidence that some were crooks.But one of the striking things about Mr Buglass’s report is that it records – as I have heard from several claimants – that it is claimants themselves who are pressing for crooks to be found and prosecuted, something which DfE has been exceptionally slow to do.Mr Buglass’s work is doubly embarrassing for DfE’s civil servants because not only does it show that their actions have led to hardship, but it also disproves one of their key claims last year.At the time, DfE confidently said that those with RHI boilers would not revert to fossil fuels because wood pellets are the cheapest form of fuel and therefore it would not make sense.But Mr Buglass’s report – consistent with what this newspaper has reported from claimants and other industry sources – found that contrary to civil servants’ claims, a signicant percentage of RHI claimants to whom he spoke have either reverted to gas or are considering doing so, in many cases because they can bulk buy lpg gas through massive poultry processor Moy Park.Read in context with everything  which we now know about RHI, Mr Buglass’s report suggests that the department which set up RHI and has repeatedly bungled the incentive since that point is still – to this day – unable to adequately run this scheme, despite putting huge civil service resources into putting it right.The day before it released Mr Buglass’s report, DfE released another report which recommended a % increase in the main tarf.That sounds like a lot, but a high percentage of a small figure is still a small figure. EvenDUP minister Diane Dodds agrees to that it would not address the scale of the hardship identied by Mr Buglass.There are only about , RHI claimants and they are easy to ignore. Many of the public will instinctively feel that they were overcompensated at such a high level that they deserve little sympathy now.That ignores the plight of those who entered the scheme because they were environmentalists or they believed Stormont’s promises, and ignores the fact that many of them were running their boilers at a low level. In fact, those who got in early and received vast sums will be fine – they will have in many cases made enough to pay off their loans. Those who claimed the least are now facing the harshest punishment.But this doesn’t just matter for them – it matters for us. At the outset of this scheme some lavishly-paid civil servants blinded themselves with complex explanations around what would have been obvious to the man in the street – paying an uncapped subsidy which is higher than the cost of fuel is disastrous.Eight years on and after all the scrutiny of RHI,common sense and basic fairness are still absent from these calculations, what hope can we have that they are present where in Stormont How RHI is managed is one of several tests of whether this new devolved regime has really changed or whether it’s the same old Stormont with a new face.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

He was also a big figure in all our lives and I would like to extend a special welcome to Tony’s we Mary, to his sons Stephen and Conor, to his daughters Cathy and Laura.“Tony’s death was not unexpected but even so there are just no easy words we can say to take away the pain.“It is a time of heartache, a time of tears. All we can do today is be whatever comfort we can to you at this dficult time.“Anyone who knew Tony ‘Archie’ Moore will know that he loved the social event of a big Wake and attended many a funeral in his day and yet here we are with just his family and a few friends here in this church.“It seems so surreal but as you all know we are living in strange times due to the restrictions imposed on us by the Coronavirus pandemic.“If these were normal times, this church would be overflowing such was Tony’s popularity.“He was first and foremost a giant of the community and the irony is, as much as he would have loved a big send off, he would have wanted us to do our best to respect the guidelines, to keep people safe and healthy at this unusual time.“Thanks to the wonders of technology, many of you in the community are watching online.”He also welcome members of Tony’s family from Australia who are also watching online.“We were all deeply saddened that Tony has left us and it is dficult to let go of the man we came to know and love.“We are privileged to be able to gather together as his family and friends here and online to pray for him.“Someone once said everyone gets to preach at their own funeral by the way they lived their le.“Well knowing Tony as I did, the man he was I believe he will preach very well.”He refered to the Gospel which was on the Beatitudes and said Tony was ‘keenly aware’ of all the blessings.“Those quality Jesus mentions became a lived reality for him.“He was keenly aware of all of the blessings God had given him and he was proud to share them with everyone he knew.“Today we mourn the death of Tony but we also celebrate a le well lived.“Tony was a man who loved le. His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him. We can see in him his wonderful sense of humour. his smile and infectious laugh which lted all our spirits.”He spoke of how fondly people spoke of Tony on Facebook, describing him as ‘an absolute gentleman’.“He always had time for everbody. He was generous to a fault, always the first to give. He was a superb neighbour. He was one of le’s real gems. He was one of le’s good guys. He was always fun-loving. He was a great man to know. He never passed you by. Always ready for a chat. He was a wonderful human being and a real friend to all who knew him. He was one of the nicest people put on this earth.“These are just some of the hundreds of comments posted on Facebook. Comments from so many who will feel his loss keenly because of the person he was and with his unique gts he touched all our lives.“Tony was indeed a person who had a great abundance of humanity. He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og. He loved the GAA. He was a true Gael.“Tony Moore was truly special and that came from something within. And that something was his faith. Tony was a man of immense faith. He embraced his Catholic faith. His whole le was founded on a deep unshakeable faith.“I had the privilege of knowing Tony. He was a great friend to me and I can pay him no greater compliment when I say he was one of the best people you’d ever meet and it was a pleasure knowing him. He was one of le’s true gents. Quite simply, he was a legend who warmed our hearts and we were all privileged to have our lives touched by him.“Tony should have got a real good send off and I know the whole of Craigavon will come to a standstill as he gave everything to the people of Craigavon and beyond.
