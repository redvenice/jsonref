They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty’s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round.

Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor.

He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty’s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/18/4CDC34C400000578-0-image-a-71_1528048511559.jpg","title":"Say cheers gastropub Cambridge professor says boost society","story":"    Cambridge University professor and sociologist Christel LaneSome say they are harbingers of gentrification – killing off traditional pub culture with their organic steaks and homemade panna cottas.But gastropubs are unfairly maligned and those who lament the demise of the old-school boozer are simply hankering after a ‘past society’ says Cambridge University professor and sociologist Christel Lane. She has examined the rise of gourmet pubs in her book From Taverns To Gastropubs, which argues that their emergence in the 1990s was a natural consequence of social changes. ‘Much of the criticism of gastropubs seems to have less to do with what they actually offer, and more with the fact that people miss a past society which is no longer there,’ she said. Sssssss-ozzled!

A report today found that the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 a fridge freezer in the flat\u0027s kitchen. A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window  The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchenThe recording was played after the publication of a damning report found the cladding put on the outside of the building did not comply \u0027with recommended fire performance\u0027 and criticised the \u0027stay-put\u0027 policy which encouraged residents to remain in their flats in the event of the fire.Fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane said the fire service\u0027s  policy had \u0027effectively failed\u0027 barely a half-hour after the fire started, but residents weren\u0027t told to evacuate for more than an hour after that.The cladding meant the fire spread up seven storeys within seven minutes,  with 70 flats ablaze in under two hours. The disaster was compounded by non-compliant fire doors, combustible window fittings and a faulty firefighting lift. Ms Lane said that a renovation of the building completed in 2016 installed flammable  cladding on the tower\u0027s facade which led to \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this article\u0027The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire\u0027 to an extent that would have support a \u0027stay put\u0027 policy, she said.Ms Lane said there had been \u0027a culture of non-compliance\u0027 with safety regulations, and identified multiple failures.The \u0027stay put\u0027 guidance which was given to residents before the fire was eventually abandoned at 2.47am - around two hours after the fire started.Ms Lane\u0027s report said it is unclear why there was such a gap between the advice being rendered redundant and the fire service changing tack, the report said.\u0027I am particularly concerned by the delay from 2.06am, when a major incident was declared, to 2.47am,\u0027 Dr Lane continued.           A photo of the flat once the debris had been cleared away shows how the other electrical items added to the damage done          Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside. The partition where sliding doors had led to the living room was almost completely burned away          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway. As firefighters moved towards the kitchen however, the fire was much more intense, scorching the hallway leading to the kitchen (right)          Grainy images taken from body cameras worn by firefighters show the moment they opened to door to the kitchen fire          The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeBut University of Dundee Professor Niamh Daeid wrote: \u0027On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in, or around, the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen.\u0027The cause of the fire remains undetermined although, based on the available information, it is more likely than not to be an accidental cause rather than a deliberate act.\u0027The originating fire within flat 16 extended out of the kitchen window of the flat and at some point re-entered through the window of the bedroom next to the living room of flat 16 causing further damage to the flat.\u0027 In a departure from information given by the Met Police, another expert said there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 that the fire was started by the fridge-freezer.In another separate report, Professor Luke Bisby, from the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \u0027Some evidence exists to support a hypothesis that the fire started in the south-east side of the kitchen and in the general area of the Hotpoint FF175P fridge-freezer, however, there is currently insufficient evidence, even based on a balance of probabilities, in my opinion, to support the hypothesis that the fire originated in the fridge-freezer, and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition.\u0027With regard to other possible sources of ignition, I have not seen sufficiently convincing evidence to confidently identify the origin of the initial fire.\u0027 Shocking footage shows how a fire which started in a kitchen of a Grenfell Tower flat leapt up the side of the building. The left hand image is timed at 1.08am, not long after the blaze began. By 1.12am the fire had already started to growIn clips estimated to have been filmed between 1.16 and 1.20am, burning debris could be seen falling from the tower, and screaming could be heard.\u0027I told you, I told you get out,\u0027 one man could be heard shouting in a further clip.Six clips showing the side of the tower as it became engulfed with flames were shown side by side.\u0027Oh my god,\u0027 one woman said as huge pieces of fiery debris rained down from the blazing tower.Another could be heard sobbing as it became apparent the fire was out of control.After the video was shown, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027It is truly shocking, every time you see it, it strikes you in a very similar way, very strongly.\u0027   This image, timed at 1.15 am, shows how, helped by flammable cladding and window materials, the fire began to grow  By 1:24am (left), the flames were burning through flats on multiple floors. An image taken from footage filmed around 1.28am (right) shows how, aided by what a report called \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027, the fire reached the top                                                      More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did nothing and a shambolic \u0027stay put\u0027 policy: Litany of Grenfell safety failings that led to a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027           \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeDeadly doors and cladding coupled with advice to victims stay in their flats as Grenfell Tower was engulfed by fire caused a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027, the inquiry into Britain\u0027s worst blaze in living memory revealed today.Expert witness Dr Barbara Lane decried the \u0027stay put\u0027 advice given by the emergency services to residents trapped in the burning building as a \u0027total failure\u0027 and \u0027substantially to blame for the tragedy\u0027.Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed it took one hour and 11 minutes for the authorities to change their minds and start an evacuation.But by then there was little hope of escaping the tower, which was engulfed in flames in just 20 minutes.Dr Lane also spoke of a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 at Grenfell, which had there were more than 100 non-compliant fire doors, a firefighting lift that didn\u0027t work and a tinderbox cladding system and draughty windows that accelerated the blaze. Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed that it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openIn 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose The lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.          A photo shows the softened uPVC finish revealing the cavity and combustible insulation board within in living room in flat 16Another of her conclusions was that key bodies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower understood how the new cladding system would behave in a fire, a report has said.In the report Dr Lane said: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027          Pictured: All of the 72 victims of the Grenfell fire disaster and where they lived  Grenfell cladding had SEVEN catastrophic faults, was incorrectly installed and \u0027substantially to blame\u0027 for disaster that killed 72, inquiry hearsGrenfell Tower\u0027s cladding did not comply with building regulations, was badly installed and created routes for a fire to spread, a damning report into the blaze has concluded.Five fire safety experts have been examining the fire in which 82 people died and today gave their views on how the fire started, how it spread and why so many people were killed.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading, she found.            The cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower was to blame for the fire spreadingAnother expert, Professor Luke Bisby, found a series of problems with refurbishment work carried out on Grenfell before the fire.Prof Bisby said the main reason the fire spread was the polyethylene-filled ACM rainscreen in the cladding.He also said combustible insulation, the presence of cavities and the use of combustible window frames added to the spread of the blaze.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleProf Bishby also identified the lack of cavity barriers between sections of the cladding, a \u0027crown detail\u0027 which helped the fire spread sideways and exposed parts of the combustible core added to the fire.In her report meanwhile, Dr Lane found there was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.She wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027        A detail from a report shows the cladding on the building which helped the fire spreadThis required smoke-control in multiple lobbies, firefighting efforts on multiple floors and on the exterior of the building, the need for a change of the evacuation strategy and the need for disabled residents to self-evacuate \u0027for which no facilities were provided within the building\u0027.The scale of the cladding\u0027s shortcomings never appears to have been grasped by any of the key bodies linked to the refurbishment.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027  Grenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with fire safety and building regulations, report finds as expert slams \u0027incompetency\u0027 in the construction industryGrenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with basic fire safety measures, a damning report has concluded.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, listed an astonishing series of shortcomings in the systems intended to mitigate fire risk.Failure to abide by regulations were identified with the block\u0027s lifts, ventilations systems, fire mains and fire doors.

Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleDr Lane and Professor Torero were among five fire safety experts drafted in to aid the Grenfell inquiry into the blaze last June which killed 72 people.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027The number of non-compliances signify a culture of non-compliance at Grenfell Tower.\u0027I am particularly concerned about the maintenance regime of the active and passive fire protection measures.\u0027I note that multiple automatic systems such as the control of the fire lift and the smoke ventilation system, appear not to have operated as required.\u0027 The weakness of the fire doors would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.            Five experts have given reports into the blaze for the inquirySmoke leaked through gaps in the frames and some would probably not have self-closed after fleeing residents, allowing it to spread further. The firefighters themselves may have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, she added.In one particularly grim case, a fire door leading to the stairwell was propped open by a body, the inquiry was told. The automatic air ventilation system in the building was also not \u0027in accordance with current statutory guidance\u0027 and there was evidence it did not operate as intended, she added.The lifts in the building similarly failed to perform effectively in the fire, hampering firefighter equipment transport and creating an \u0027unnecessary risk\u0027 to residents who could not use it to escape.For firefighters, the tower had a \u0027dry fire main\u0027 - meaning the fire service had to pump it with its own water - that was \u0027non-compliant with the design guidance in force at the time of the original construction and is also non-compliant with current standards\u0027.This stopped crews getting water to the upper floors as effectively as a wet main, which provides more pressure by being already charged with a pump that is connected when the service arrives.  Professor Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.  In his report, Prof Torero said the current regulatory framework relies \u0027very heavily\u0027 on competent professionals interpreting the guidelines in such a way that will bridge any gaps and ambiguities.But he claimed there was no definition of the level of competency required from professionals involved in designing and installing cladding systems which would guarantee the delivery of \u0027societally acceptable levels of safety\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There is a need to shift from a culture that inappropriately trivialises \u0027compliance\u0027 to a culture that recognises complexity in \u0027compliance\u0027 and therefore values \u0027competency\u0027, \u0027performance\u0027 and \u0027quality\u0027.\u0027Otherwise, the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027 He wrote: \u0027Functional requirements, guidelines and simple standardised tests become insufficient tools to establish adequate performance of systems where performance is a function of the interactions of the building and the building envelope.\u0027The inadequacy of these methods of performance assessmentregulation is such that systems that can introduce obvious dangers can be incorporated by designers in a routine manner.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/17/4CE82CC700000578-5803229-image-a-44_1528128092277.jpg","title":"Travellers dump hundreds tons building waste garbage M1 underpass","story":"    Nine lanes of motorway traffic drive over the underpass which is being turned into an unofficial dump site.

A table from a report published today shows how quickly flats were engulfedDr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading.In a report published on Monday, Dr Lane wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027Windows in inidual flats had no fire barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material, the expert found.Such a shortcoming \u0027increased the likelihood of that fire breaking into the large cavities contained within the cladding system\u0027 and provided \u0027no means to control the spread of fire and smoke\u0027.The gap beyond the window, in turn, was supposed to have fire-stops at intervals which would halt the advance of flames - but these were installed incorrectly.There was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.

Only series can be registered as trademarks, not inidual titles, and common words can’t be registered at all, unless the public associates it with a particular use.In May, several romance authors reported receiving letters from Hopkins asking them to stop using the word in their titles and requesting that they change them. Hopkins, according to the Authors Guild, later “tried to block the sale of books by other romance writers that included the word”. She then applied for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to prevent the publication of a collection of stories by various authors, Cocktales: The Cocky Collective, which was written as an act of protest against Hopkins’s trademark.Her lawsuit was filed against Tara Crescent, author of another book series that used the word “cocky”, the lawyer Kevin Kneupper, who had filed a legal challenge to have Hopkins’s trademark in “cocky” cancelled, and Cocktales’s publicist Jennifer Watson.The Authors Guild and Romance Writers of America joined forces to provide Crescent with legal assistance and “defend the principle that no one should be able to own exclusive rights to use a common word” in book titles. They argued that “countless romance novels employed ‘cocky’” in their titles well before Hopkins laid claim to it, that “no one should hold a monopoly on cocky”, and that “cockiness (in all its permutations) remains as prevalent in romance novels as the use of stunning, scantily clad models on their covers”.It would be, they wrote, “like an author claiming trademark rights in the word death as a series title for murder mysteries and suing anyone who used that word in the title of their crime stories”.“Any order that restricts creative expression in favour of promoting the tenuous (at best) purported rights of a single author is simply contrary to the public interest in freedom of expression,” wrote the guild, adding that it “seldom” litigates for inidual authors, but felt in this case that it was “an important issue for authors generally”.In the case, heard in a New York court on Friday, judge Alvin Hellerstein described romance readers as “sophisticated purchasers” unlikely to be confused between different authors’ books, found that cocky was a “weak trademark”, and denied Hopkins’s motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order to stop the publication of books with the word “cocky” in the title. Kneupper, who was removed from the case, will be allowed to continue his legal challenge to Hopkin’s trademark in relation to the word’s use in series titles.“Authors should be able to express themselves in their choice of titles,” said the Authors Guild in a statement after the hearing. “A single word commonly used in book titles cannot be “owned” by one author. This is especially true when, as here, the word has already been in use by other authors in titles for years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45389d655f54419ce914ea7def364147a330332e/59_307_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecec755e44147b627b4a022f1bc44145","title":"uk government to sell stake in rbs worth almost 26bn","story":"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, kickstarts sale of 925 million sharesPhilip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss.The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.”The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said.The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament.However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b526148c33626d62c4b8db9a3ca65207118e6ca5/0_315_4815_2889/4815.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd204d503aa07ac68dccde896cdabee1","title":"what to do in toronto a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A year-round cultural buzz from the film festival, plus amazing architecture and a huge history of ethnic ersity mean there’s a lot to be seen, done and eaten in the Ontarian capital. Get the best of ‘Canada’s downtown’ with a two-day itinerary from local writer Jim ByersMorningStart with a tour of the city’s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historianman-about-town Bruce Bell will show you interesting views of the St. Lawrence Market (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) – and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel Bakery. For about £4 (C$7), you’ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at Uno Mustachio. Want something more formal? The highly rated Biagio is nearby.AfternoonFrom the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There’s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that’s your thing.EveningStop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at Mill Street Brew Pub. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you’re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at Balzac’s (open ’til 8pm) – grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include Corktown Designs (nice jewellery) and John Fluevog for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, El Catrin restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.MorningTry breakfast at Over Easy, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to Dineen, just a few blocks north.To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the Toronto Islands also allows you the park experience plus a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward’s Island. There’s a legal nude beach at Hanlan’s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.AfternoonSome visitors hit the heights at the CN Tower (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it’s best to enjoy the view after you’ve seen a bit and know what you’re looking at. You can try the Edge Walk and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.Kensington Market is one of the city’s other iconic sights. It’s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it’s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and CentralSouth American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at Rasta Pasta for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try Amadeu’s for a taste of Portugal.EveningA drink on the Ritz-Carlton terrace is in order. It’s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is the Wheat Sheaf, billed as Toronto’s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, Rhum Corner has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city’s “hippest” street. Boralia makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605). Grab a gourmet ice cream sandwich at Bang Bang Ice Cream to finish your night.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9782b4c2e169ab67c091ca14a0315538c2b5ea0f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb344b738bfdeb0a74dd95b3f74ff8","title":"a fashion lovers guide to canada","story":"Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …What I knew about Canada before I embarked on my one-week, three-city trip this summer was limited to a handful of sources: 90s TV show North of 60, Drake songs (which can arguably be seen as a Toronto guidebook written by its most famous resident), and the work of iconic brands such as Roots and Herschel.What I didn’t know was that by the time I left, I’d have discovered one of the most talented crops of local makers and designers anywhere in the world, eaten the best tacos of my life, and experienced a view – on the summit of Vancouver’s Howe Sound – that made me feel insignificant in the best possible way. And that’s to say nothing of the incredible people I met – and the raw energy of the country’s erse, accepting and multicultural cities. Canada really is a place without barriers – somewhere no one could feel like an outsider.I arrived in Toronto with high expectations and I can honestly say that they were surpassed. World-class boutiques, killer vintage finds and an unmistakable big town buzz. This is a city that has its pulse on contemporary fashion.Ice cream and being seen on Queen Street WestQueen Street West is Toronto’s creative and fashion hub – and somewhere that’s been on my radar since Vogue crowned it one of the world’s top three hippest neighbourhoods in 2014. It’s easy to see why. Not only is it home to high-end destination boutiques, such as Nomad, but it’s also a platform for Toronto’s homegrown talent – there are a lot of independent boutiques supporting each other in this prime location.I discovered local makers such as YNOT and Kotn, who are representing everything that’s great about contemporary Toronto as a city and Canada as a country with their designs. YNOT’s sturdy, stylish rucksacks and hardwearing jackets call to mind how connected to nature you are in Canada – even in the middle of its biggest city – while Kotn’s clean and elegant basics represent luxury in its simplest form.If you’re looking to mix local selections with high-end international pieces, head to Nomad – the boutique stocks an excellent range of powerhouse names such as Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. My top Queen Street West tip? Take a long stroll, heading west to east, with an ice cream in hand from iHalo Krunch.Vintage finds in Kensington MarketIf you love vintage, there’s nowhere better than Kensington Market. This hip, colourful neighbourhood near downtown Toronto has a plethora of stores packed with wonderful finds. It has an amazing sense of street life too: turn any corner and you’ll find bars with small outdoor performance spaces, full of drinkers enjoying a show in the sun, or – as I did – dining at truly quirky restaurants, such as Rasta Pasta, the home of Jamaican-Italian fusion.Seeing where the magic happens at the Roots factoryRoots is probably the quintessential Canadian brand. Again, the strong connection to nature comes through in what it produces. Roots has been part of pop culture for years, yet still manages to feel current – proved by its recent collaboration with Drake. The rapper had a range of varsity jackets for his OVO label co-produced with the brand.I had the chance to visit the factory, which was fascinating from my perspective as a tailor and designer, to get an insight into its production processes. One thing is for sure: they really know their leather. It was also great to understand who makes it and why. Walking into the factory, you see flags everywhere, representing all of the different nations Roots’ employees come from. It really reflects Canada’s multicultural vibe – people bring their own roots to Roots.Cool Canadiana at Drake General StoreJust across the street from the Drake Hotel on Queen West, Drake General Store is like a souvenir shop for people who wouldn’t normally buy souvenirs. It’s a stylish space full of considered Canadiana, where all of the products have a curated feel – from the beautiful Alberta-made blanket I picked up, to the artisan maple syrup I brought for my friend who runs a cafe back home in south London. If you’re only visiting Toronto but want to get a sense of the whole of Canada, it’s the place to go.New architecture and timeless art at the Art Gallery of OntarioI was really excited to see the recent Frank Gehry extension of the Art Gallery of Ontario it’s a stunning addition to an already stunning building. Inside, I got to see some of the fantastic work by the Group of Seven – a group of Canadian landscape painters who initiated Canada’s first major national art movement.Fring’s by name, fring by natureNamed and frequented by Drake, Fring’s delivers a unique fusion of Asian and soul food under the stewardship of Canadian celebrity chef Susur Lee. Fring’s derives its name from Canadian-Caribbean patois, translating roughly to “good times remembered” – and after one meal here I’ve got no reservations in saying that the moniker fits. It’s an intimate space with a first-rate interior fit out, and the Hong Kong chicken and waffles with maple chili glaze were unforgettable.If only I’d had more than two days in Montreal. It’s a city unlike any other – a perfect blend of European charm and North American hustle. It’s also a place for those who love the finer things in life: amazing food, slick bars and very stylish people.Mont RoyalThe size and scale of the green spaces in Canada’s cities is something that I still struggle to get my head around – Montreal’s Mont Royal, also known as Mount Royal, is no exception. The vista over the city from the highest point of the park takes in all of downtown Montreal, while the walking route back downhill towards Saint-Laurent offers a great view of the nine-storey Leonard Cohen mural keeping watch over his old borough.Sheer ‘jeanius’ at Naked \u0026amp Famous DenimBrandon Svarc is a denim genius. Producing jeans under his Naked \u0026amp Famous moniker, he’s a maker who knows his product so well that he can stretch it to its limits – whether its dyeing jeans in green tea or red wine, or producing the heaviest pair of jeans in the world out of 32oz Japanese selvedge denim. The Naked \u0026amp Famous factory is right on top of the store. The denim gets made on the third floor and is sold downstairs in the Tate \u0026amp Yoko boutique.My idea of heaven at Maison CloakroomI wasn’t expecting this: a premium men’s tailoring retailer with its own speakeasy. In other words, something like my idea of heaven. Maison Cloakroom is housed in a beautiful 19th-century townhouse on Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal. This place sums up that distinctive Montreal feel – old and new, European and American – more than anywhere else in the city.Meeting the makers at Lowell MTLLowell MTL may take its name from the region of Massachusetts that was once home to a large population of French Canadians (Jack Kerouac the most famous of them), but it is a Montreal brand to the core – all of its products take inspiration from locations in and around the city. Mathieu Mudie and Rachel Fortin, the husband and wife team behind Lowell MTL, made the brand’s name producing premium leather accessories, but they have since expanded into stylish men’s and women’s clothing ranges.The ultimate Reuben at Dunn’s FamousYou can’t leave Montreal without trying a classic smoked meat sandwich from one of the city’s famous delis. As with any local specialty, there’s always hot debate about who does the best, but it’s hard to imagine anywhere outdoing the full-fat, classic Reuben at Dunn’s Famous – a sandwich piled impossibly high with Dunn’s famous smoked brisket, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island sauce.Returning the favour at LovSometimes you just stumble upon one of the best places in town. That’s what happened with Lov. We found this place after taking a wrong turn en route to another restaurant. But it only took one look at what was coming out of the kitchen to convince us to stay – smart, innovative vegetarian dishes just asking to be washed down with one of Lov’s signature botanical cocktails. So good we returned the following night.By now I should have been used to just how close to nature you are in any Canadian city, but Vancouver takes it up a notch: from downtown you can be right on the water in 15 minutes walk. It’s something you can feel with the relaxed, west coast attitude of the people, and something that really comes through in the work of local makers Herschel and Dayton Boots, who have put Vancouver on the world style map.Colour and craftsmanship at the Museum of AnthropologySet deep in the leafy campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology is home to a vast collection of indigenous artworks and cultural artefacts. I was lucky enough to have met Haida designer and artist Dorothy Grant at her home and studio before my visit – she gave me a real understanding of the varying colours and shapes used by different tribes. Seeing the level of craftsmanship on the totems, masks, garments and weaves on display up close was an experience I will never forget.Revolutionary fabrics at HerschelIt’s great to see such a young brand doing what it does so confidently. Herschel bags have made their mark so strongly as a street style staple since 2009 that, for me, they’ve become virtually synonymous with the idea of a rucksack. As a tailor, it was fascinating to see the work that the brand is doing in producing its own materials, such as the ApexKnit: a groundbreaking new fabric from which its makers are able to produce a single-piece rucksack.A fine legacy at Dayton BootsDayton Boots represents so much of what is great about Vancouver’s makers and the city’s style ethos. The brand started out more than 70 years ago, making boots for loggers. Today, their product is still as sturdy and well-crafted as it was then – but like so many great workwear brands, what they produce works just as well as a contemporary look. I’d recommend taking a look for yourself – the Dayton Boots factory is open to the public and right behind their flagship store on East Hastings Street.Record shopping and more in GastownGastown is home to one of the best record shops in the city – Beat Street Records, just around the corner from Gastown’s famous Steam clock.I’m a lover of jazz, funk and hip-hop and was blown away by the selections: among them releases by J-Dilla and Slum Village that I’d never come across in London, and hard-to-come-by rarities by Thelonious Monk and a load of other jazz greats. Of course, record shops aren’t the only thing you’ll find in Gastown. It’s a neighbourhood that has long been considered the spot for fine eating and drinking in Vancouver. Try Bao Down for some of Vancouver’s best Asian fusion street food.No more tacos after TacofinoAnd then there was Tacofino. What can I say about this place, other than is sells simply the finest tacos I’ve ever eaten. They were so good that I haven’t been able to find anything close since returning to London – it just feels like we’re not doing it right. But it’s not just the tacos – Tacofino also distinguishes itself with west coast-inspired ceviche, tostadas and nachos, as well as the phenomenal chilli salt wings with lime and valentina.The view to end all views, from the Sea to Sky GondolaIf you’re going to Vancouver, you have to take the Sea to Sky Gondola. It takes you over some of the most incredible natural scenery I saw in Canada, and it’s all less than an hour’s drive away from the city centre. The view from the summit was awe-inspiring, and many of the hiking trails coursing up the ascent were easily walkable for a beginner like me. It’s one of those places that makes you and your problems feel small – and all the better for it.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canadaPhotography: Momme Halbe and Taryn Paterson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceff7e56463a0fb27da6a6b2e75ae32d62b72f1e/154_293_3139_1883/master/3139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd33673569bfbdc962bb3c5e00f67e89","title":"concussion loris karius liverpool goalkeeper champions league final massachusetts","story":"Loris Karius’s calamitous performance in the Champions League final could have been a result of concussion he sustained against Real Madrid, a doctor who assessed the Liverpool goalkeeper in Boston has said.Liverpool sent Karius for a head scan at Massachusetts General Hospital last Thursday amid concern at his reaction to a collision with Real’s captain, Sergio Ramos. The 24‑year‑old made two major errors that contributed to Real’s 3-1 victory. The first presented Karim Benzema with the opening goal and came soon after he received a blow to the head from Ramos as they challenged at the near post. Later Karius allowed Gareth Bale to put the contest beyond Liverpool with a long-range shot that squirmed through his hands.The German flew to the US on holiday after the final but Liverpool’s medical department was sufficiently concerned about the impact of Ramos’s challenge that it arranged a scan in Boston. Karius had a consultation with Dr Ross Zafonte, an authority on head-trauma injuries suffered by NFL players and the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Massachusetts General.A statement released on Monday by the hospital on Dr Zafonte’s behalf and with the player’s permission confirmed that Karius had been concussed.It read: “On May 31, 2018 Mr Karius underwent a comprehensive examination by Dr Ross Zafonte and Dr Lenore Herget in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history – including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms – physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr Karius sustained a concussion during the match 26\u0026nbspMay 2018.“At the time of our evaluation Mr Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event. Additional symptomatic and objectively noted areas of dysfunction also persisted. It could be possible that such deficits would affect performance.“We also note that Mr Karius has reported significant and steady improvement since the concussive event, and we expect him to make a full recovery based on the results of the examination. We expect that with treatment and by following prescribed activity protocols he will continue to improve. We have encouraged vigilance and an emphasis on safety in his eventual return to full activity.”Karius has continued his holiday in California following the assessment in Boston and is due to return to pre-season training with Liverpool on 2 July.The Anfield club have been fined €20,000 (£17,567) for disturbances at the Champions League quarter-final first leg in April, which included an attack on the Manchester City bus, Uefa announced on Monday. They were also fined €9,000 (£7,904) over the setting off of fireworks in the second leg with City and in the second leg of the semi-final at Roma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9978c8520f04d994d09316a72d9d4e8c68b2774d/0_76_8478_5087/master/8478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=370f1f08087c6c9b05ac9ad1018b603f","title":"anna jones radish recipes roasted salad","story":"Peppery radishes roast beautifully with dates and preserved lemons, or raw they bring freshness to a herb and sumac saladRadishes, those cheering orbs of bright pink, are at their best now.

Witness these two very different sweet and sour salads one raw and Turkish-inspired with pomegranate molasses, the other with roasted radishes, dates and preserved lemon, with the grassy green of fresh herbs offsetting the neon pink.You can use a mandoline or food processor to speed up the radish chopping.

The organisation has more 40 investigators working full-time on the inquiry, aided by 20 external legal and forensic digital recovery experts. The investigation, which will incorporate the one being undertaken into Cambridge Analytica, is looking at 30 separate organisations and the actions of around a dozen iniduals.However, she warned that misuse of data was widespread across the internet and was not confined to the Facebook platform or this particular case.“We have seen that the behavioural advertising ecosystem has been applied across political campaigning to influence how we may vote,” she told MEPs.“I am deeply concerned about the fact that this has happened without due legal or ethical considerations of the impacts on our democratic system.” Denham said her organisation was one of the best-resourced data regulators in Europe and warned MEPs from other countries that they should provide more funding to their national equivalent.“I recognise that some aspects of our legal systems have failed to keep up with the unforeseen pace of the internet.” Denham was giving evidence to the European parliament alongside Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, former Facebook employee Sandy Parakilas, and US professor David Carroll.Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who went public with his concerns earlier this year, told MEPs the issue helped cause Brexit: “This crisis is not just one of privacy, it is one that may have led the EU to losing one of its largest member states. “What I witnessed at Cambridge Analytica should alarm everyone. Cambridge Analytica is the canary in the coal mine of a new Cold war emerging online.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c59285912ea176646bc23d00ca5464aabfecff/0_27_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b60f9a2c32cc1b35baa1f9b593f9792d","title":"reliable builder websites traders","story":"We examine how the main websites that list tradespeople measure upForget sun, sand and sea. For many, this summer will be all about skips, cement and the builder’s drill. For those planning home improvements, the key question will\u0026nbspbe where they can find a reliable tradesperson.Some 45,000 people called Citizens Advice last year seeking help with their home improvement and maintenance problems, and the Federation of Master Builders estimates cowboy contractors cost the UK economy £10bn a year.So which of the websites that vet traders should consumers turn to?On this commercial site, traders pay to quote for jobs posted by customers, who can then leave feedback about them. The identities and qualifications of traders who apply to join are verified, and data analysis tools are used to check they have not been banned in the past and that the reviews are by genuine customers.Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services. Traders have the right to reply, and a decision about whether to suspend their membership is made within 72 hours. “We get threatened with legal action all the time by traders, but we don’t bow into pressure to remove bad reviews,” says Peter Wellock, head of customer service.Another commercial site where traders pay to quote for jobs and the qualifications of those who apply to join are verified. Rated People speaks to every trader by phone or in person before they apply. One out of every four are blocked by its screening process, which includes fraud and credit checks. Those accepted typically pay £55 plus VAT per month on average, which allows them to quote for a limited number of jobs. Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services.Between five and 15 of the 90,000 jobs posted per month end in a dispute, says chief executive Celia Francis. “Often, the tradesperson will fix the problem and the customer will take the review down.” Sometimes, customer services will refer both parties to a mediation service, which costs each of them £25. The ultimate sanction is removal of membership.A commercial directory of 29,000 vetted traders who pay a minimum of £70 plus VAT per month to be listed. They have to pass a face-to-face interview and provide a minimum of five references. Qualifications and public liability insurance are examined, and background and identity checks carried out. All traders must agree to a code of conduct and allow Checkatrade to talk to Trading Standards about their work.Customers can review work online or via a Freepost postcard. Negative feedback is published within five days as long as reviewers give Checkatrade permission to contact the trader about the complaint. The tradesperson will then be allowed a right to reply and encouraged to put things right. The website may also decide to remove the trader from its directory.This is a non-profit, government-endorsed scheme intended to raise standards among tradespeople. Registered firms that are members of 32 recognised trade bodies and scheme operators, which have been vetted by TrustMark, can pay £40 a year to display its logo and be listed on the website. Currently, around 12,500 businesses are on the site.Traders have to sign up to a code of conduct and undergo background checks on their identity and business. They will also receive an on-site inspection at their place of business and at a site where they have carried out work.Work quality is checked by an expert, so users do not need to rely on reviews from other customers, says chief executive Simon Ayers. Those with complaints will be able to take up their issue with the trader and their scheme operator.An independent, not-for-profit directory of 3,550 vetted traders, run by Trading Standards and supported by 56 local authorities. Only those who have been trading for at least six months may pay £125 plus VAT to apply to be listed. A Trading Standards officer will then audit the business. Background and financial checks are done to look for criminal convictions. Previous customers are randomly selected for\u0026nbspreferences, although the work is not inspected.The website has access to a Trading Standards database and can check traders aren’t generating complaints to Citizens Advice, says the directory’s operations manager, Rachael Holden.Any claims traders make about their business or qualifications are verified. Only traders who pass this audit and have a complaints procedure can join.Which site works best? All five were tested with a search to “refresh my garden” in Cambridge so that costs could be\u0026nbspcompared.No one on MyBuilder wanted to quote and only one Rated People gardener, who was not affiliated to any scheme and did not list any qualifications on his website, offered a quote but wanted to visit the garden.When called, he said he charged £180 a day for labour and was available to start in two weeks. When the job was not offered to him, he called back two hours later to stress he had\u0026nbsp“bought” the job from Rated People. He had 15 five-star ratings out of 15 possible reviews.The Checkatrade directory gave details of two firms within five miles that had been given feedback in the past month. Both had more than 50 reviews and scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. The first refused to give a quote without visiting the garden, but promised a gardener would then be available to do the work within two weeks. The second quoted £350 per day for two people’s labour, but was booked up until\u0026nbspSeptember.On TrustMark, a trader who was a member of the Association of Professional Landscapers, the Horticultural Trades Association and Buy With Confidence quoted £320 to £350 per day for two people’s labour over the phone, but said he was booked up until early next year.The closest Buy With Confidence landscape gardener, who was a member of the Gardeners Guild and the Countryside Management Association, and a Green Flag Awards judge, said he was too busy to take on any work until next year.Visiting all five directories, reading the reviews, checking out inidual websites and qualifications, and making phone calls took well over an hour but achieved little. In the end, it was a relief that a landscape gardener was not needed after all. The ideal trader would have been both a member of TrustMark and Buy With Confidence whose work had been inspected by an expert in their field, as well as being a business approved by a Trading Standards officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd907d235232c8ebcbce339ff3460facfc0160fa/67_452_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0b2f7313e51abfcf54b53e32b5c2db","title":"clarity on brexit plan now urgent business bosses tell theresa may","story":"Executives at No 10 business advisory council ask for more information to adequately prepare for trade post-BrexitBusiness chiefs have warned Theresa May that they urgently needed clarity on the government’s plans for Brexit to help them prepare their companies after the UK leaves the European Union in just ten months time. After a meeting of the prime minister’s business advisory council at No 10, which included leading firms Tesco, GlaxoSmithKline and BAE Systems, executives suggested that they needed more information on issues such as customs arrangements.However, it has emerged that the government’s Brexit white paper, which was expected to be published within weeks, could be delayed until after the crunch EU summit at the end of June. The delay of the document, which was intended to put the UK on the front foot in negotiations but is said to still be “riddled with red ink”, underlines the deep ides that continue to exist in cabinet over customs plans and the Irish border. May’s official spokesman was unable to say whether the white paper, expected to include detail on areas including financial services, security and dispute settlement, would be ready by the Brussels summit. “I’ve not put a timeframe on it, other than we will bring it forward as soon as possible,” he said.No 10 said the June summit was simply a “staging post” towards Brexit while other government sources suggested that the EU would primarily be seeking progress on the so-called backstop option.Edwin Morgan, head of media relations at the Institute of Directors, which was represented at the talks, added: “Businesses need clarity about the government’s objectives to help them to plan. Everything is still subject to negotiation with the EU, but we don’t yet know what the UK will pushing for in key areas like customs. “Our members want to know whether the Government’s forthcoming white paper will make clear their intentions on VAT, customs and regulatory alignment – to understand in what areas ministers foresee continued harmonisation with EU rules, and where they want freedom to erge.”It has been reported that the UK may seek to stay inside the EU’s VAT area after Brexit, which would require the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, one of May’s red lines.The business leaders were also said to have warned the prime minister that maintaining frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit was probably more important than the imposition of any tariffs.After the meeting, a No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister provided an update on the negotiations … setting out plans to provide greater detail of the future relationship in a white paper due to be published shortly. “The business representatives expressed their support for this approach, which will build on information provided through the prime minister’s various speeches.“Brexit secretary David Davis, chancellor Philip Hammond, business secretary Greg Clark and trade secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting. Earlier, No 10 insisted the UK would be “fully prepared” for leaving the EU without a deal after reports civil servants have been drawing up scenarios for an “armageddon” Brexit that would leave the country short of medicine, fuel and food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6619256c9dd33ee152f75d3b824fd8ff7cae15/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0d7b5fddf69b638aa83dcbf8fbb82","title":"did you solve it world cup arithmetic","story":"The solutions to today’s puzzlesOn my puzzle blog earlier today I set you three football table challenges:1) England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G in the 2018 World Cup. Imagine that once they have all played each other the table looks like this.If you know only that England beat Tunisia 3-0, can you deduce the score of every other match in the group?(For non football fans: the F column is “goals for”, meaning how many goals the team scored in total, the A column is “goals against”, meaning how many goals the team conceded in total, and the P column is “points”, when 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.)EXTRA CLARIFICATION: Some readers pointed out that Belgium should be above Tunisia in the table, because goal difference is the tie-break when two teams are equal on points. This observation is correct, but does not affect the puzzle. The reason that the error crept in is that I updated the puzzle from one written in 1921 when there must have been a different criterion for the tie-break. Thanks to everyone who spotted the mistake.We know by looking at the points that England won all three games, Tunisia and Belgium both won, drew and lost a game, and Panama lost all three games. Let’s consider Tunisia, which lost to England 3-0. Tunisia must have beaten Panama (since everyone did) and therefore drawn with Belgium, scoring 2 goals and conceding 0 across these two games. The only way this combination is possible is if they won 2-0, and drew 0-0, since if they scored a goal in the draw with Belgium, they would have conceded another goal, which we know they didn’t since they only conceded 3 in total. So far we have:And the games left areEngland conceded only one goal. Panama scored only one goal. Let’s assume that the goal scored by Panama was conceded by England. In that case, Belgium did not score against England. So Belgium must have scored 3 goals against Panama. We know that Tunisia scored 2 against Panama. But that means that England can only have scored a single goal against Panama, since Panama only conceded 6. Yet our assumption was that Panama scored a goal against England, meaning this match would have been a draw, which we know is incorrect. We conclude that our assumption was wrong, and that the goal scored by Panama was against Belgium, and the goal conceded by England was also scored by Belgium. So, of Belgium’s three goals, one was against England. The other two must have been against Panama, since they won that game despite conceding a goal. Thus Belgium beat Panama 2-1. Panama conceded 6 in total, so England beat Panama 2-0, and beat Belgium 2-1.I’m only going to give you a sketch of how to solve this one. First, you need to know that the goals for and the goals column must always be equal. Since Slovakia has a goal difference of zero, the goals they scored are equal to the goals they conceded. Which means that the goals the other three teams scored are equal to the goals the other three teams conceded. Thus Wales and Russia conceded one goal each. Next, looking at the order of the teams, you can work out how many of the games each team must have won, drawn and lost, and once you have that you can work out the exact scores. For example England are top but they cannot have won all three games, since you cannot win all three games and have a negative goal difference. Here’s the full table.3. I asked if it was possible to design a football table puzzle in which only a single number is given and from which we can deduce every single result between the teams. (Assume that all matches have been played). I think the only possible answer is if the team that is in first place has a 0 in the “goals for” slot. Since from this we can deduce that every match must have ended 0-0. This means all teams are on 3 points. If this were a World Cup group, there would be a tie-break to determine who comes top, which under current rules are be Fair Play points. It is the null solution...but still interesting that we can deduce all the results from a single number. Does anyone know if there has ever been a four-team group in any major competition with only 0-0 results?I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles.

He said it was the only one of its species to have been discovered.A dinosaur expert, Eric Geneste, had previously said it was impossible to classify the skeleton as an allosaurus because it was more robust, with longer shoulder blades and a different number of teeth. “There are as many differences between it and an allosaurus as between a human and a gorilla,” he said.Japanese and Swedish telephone bidders also tried to buy the bones, pushing the bidding above the €1.8m estimate.In 2016, the French auction house sold an allosaurus, called Kan, for €1.1m. Mickeler said: “Herbivores do not quite excite businessmen who buy dinosaurs the same way as carnivores do. They want to buy carnivores like themselves.”Part of the proceeds of the sale of Kan, which was bought by a British collector, will go to towards funding further archaeological digs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50915c23c7bed229044b504bef33adede07d3d7d/0_0_3125_1876/master/3125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41d4ac51dee88aad89c2e0c866aa8951","title":"the days are getting longer but very very slowly","story":"As the moon pulls away from the Earth, our planet’s rotation is slowing, making our days 175,000 second longer each year If the day never seems long enough to get everything done, be grateful at least that times have changed. According to fresh calculations, a day on Earth was a full five hours and fifteen minutes shorter a billion or so years ago, well before complex life spread around the planet.Scientists used a combination of astronomical theory and geochemical signatures buried in ancient rocks to show that 1.4bn years ago the Earth turned a full revolution on its axis every 18 hours and 41 minutes.The number means that, on average, the length of the day on Earth has grown by approximately one 74 thousandth of a second per year since Precambrian times, a trend that is expected to continue for millions, if not billions, of years more. As the Earth’s rotation gradually winds down, the moon moves further away. Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stephen Meyers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Alberto Malinverno at Columbia University in New York calculate that over the past 1.4bn years the moon has drifted about 44,000km from Earth to a distance of 384,400km.Meyers and Malinvern set themselves the task of reconstructing changes in the distance between the Earth and the moon, and variations in Earth’s orbit, along with wobbles and tilts known as Milankovitch cycles, further back in time than ever before. Until now, it has been hard to work out reliable figures for more than 50m years ago.Because Milankovitch cycles affect how much sun reaches the planet’s poles, they are prime drivers of climate change over timescales ranging from tens of thousands of years to millions of years. To pin down the frequency of the cycles in Earth’s deep history, the scientists looked at copper and aluminium ratios linked to climate change in the 1.4bn-year-old Xiamaling marine sediment in northern China, and the 55 m-year-old Walvis ridge in the south Atlantic, and fed these into a model.“We were interested in reconstructing the Milankovitch cycles because they provide a powerful tool for evaluating the history of our planet, and the solar system. They are like signposts on a trail, allowing us to navigate geological history,” said Meyers. “For example, the identification of Milankovitch cycles in sediments ning the past million years has revolutionised our understanding of the nature of ice ages, the instability of ice sheets, and how Earth’s climate system works.”As for the moon, it will not retreat from Earth forever. At some point in the far future, it will reach a stable distance when it will be visible only from one half of Earth, and never seen from the other.

Dr Vaishnavy Vilvanathan Laxman failed to perform an emergency caesarean section and instead proceeded with a regular delivery, a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel said in a report. This was despite the baby – known as Baby B – being feet first in the breech position, having a prolapsed cord and low heart rate, and the mother’s cervix being less than 4cm dilated. The panel found the decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery “set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B”. It added: “But for Dr Vilvanathan Laxman’s error of judgment in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.” Laxman was a consultant at Ninewells hospital in Dundee when she was called to assist with a 30-year-old first-time mother, known as Patient A, who was 25 weeks pregnant in March 2014. The tribunal said the mother was taken to theatre and, given the complications, “the only appropriate course in these circumstances was a caesarean section which would have been the quickest mode of delivery given the risks attendant upon a vaginal delivery, namely head entrapment, which would inevitably have delayed the birth”.The tribunal ruled that the baby died before the decapitation. A pathologist told the tribunal that the damage to the baby’s neck and decapitation “would most likely be attributed to the pulling and stretching forces applied to Baby B’s body during attempts to deliver the head”. In Patient A’s evidence, given while clutching two teddy bears, she told the tribunal she had previously been told because her baby was in breech it would be delivered by caesarean section “if anything happened”.She said: “I was not given gas and air – I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.“I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them ‘it doesn’t feel right, stop it, what’s going on, I don’t want to do it’, but nobody responded to me in any way.”The tribunal will later make a decision on whether Laxman’s fitness to practice is impaired or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1de1a859c50a1b0ca217bb163cc1125084e9403/220_247_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e63da5dff29c74b0a3ea6bcfae657e66","title":"jos buttler test rediscovery england cricket one day specialist","story":"England one-day specialist is a thinker about the game and even at the age of 27 there is plenty of time remaining for him to have a decent Test careerA cricketer’s life is a short one and so evolution is consequently rapid. A fresh-faced bright young thing surfaces amid great excitement and curiosity suddenly they somehow evolve into an established international cricketer and then after minimal blinking there is the gnarled old pro maybe pondering a career as a coach or a pundit once the playing days are gone. It all happens so fast.Imperceptibly Jos Buttler seems to have arrived at that middle stage. He is 27 now he has played 190 times for England, 20 of which have been in Test cricket, and since his return to the red-ball game has so far proven to be a damn fine idea, the chances of him resuming as a three-format cricketer are now excellent.He is not yet gnarled, but it is almost seven years since he first played for England in a Twenty20 match against India at Old Trafford. The management team increasingly seek his opinion – with good reason. For such an instinctive, free-spirited batsman, Buttler thinks seriously about the game.The past fortnight has prompted Buttler’s career to swerve in an exciting direction – for him and for those who treasure Test cricket. The manner in which he changed gear on Sunday morning, from dutiful Test batsman to devastating destroyer, made for compelling viewing.His success in two Tests against Pakistan has suggested, contrary to the age-old mantras, that it is possible to swerve from T20 to Test cricket without any intervening period of rehabilitation in the longer game – provided you are blessed with exceptional talent and a clear mind. Before the match at Lord’s Buttler mentioned that he felt as if he was making another debut after his 18-month absence from Test cricket and he returned to that theme after the game at Headingley.Chris Woakes has joined Ben Stokes on the injury sidelines for England’s first one-day international of the summer against Scotland on Sunday.Woakes, who will be replaced by Tom Curran in the squad to play in Edinburgh, left the field at Headingley on Sunday with a thigh injury. An ECB statement read: “Woakes will be assessed this week to ascertain if he’ll be fit for the Australia series.” Curran has eight ODI caps and was part of the team which won in New Zealand three months ago. Jos Buttler is to be rested for Sunday’s game. “My mentality has been similar to my first few Tests, not worrying about external factors, just trying to play the game and trusting myself‚“ he said. “But the big difference is experience,” he said. “When I was a young player I didn’t really believe in experience when the older guys told me I would improve or understand things in time. I used to think you could either do it or you couldn’t. But now I understand how valuable experience is, not only on the field but in the stuff that goes on beyond it.”Buttler excelled with the bat at the start of his Test career before petering out and he can now rationalise why. “I started to think too much about how not to get out as opposed to how to score runs and I got into a really bad rut. The only way out of it was to be dropped, which actually released a lot of pressure.”This is a point worth remembering for selectors. Rather than being consumed by giving someone countless chances in an effort to be fair, it is worth recalling how a cricketer can benefit from being dropped and having the space to reassess.Buttler has returned to Test cricket via the white-ball game. In particular his form in the Indian Premier League this spring enabled him to start a Test with confidence high, even if his surprise selection also represented a voyage of discovery – or rediscovery.“The IPL gave me huge amounts of confidence, to be in those pressure situations in India, in front of big crowds and being one of the overseas players‚” he said. “For me, not trying to worry about the colour of the ball definitely helps.”He explains some of the different demands of T20 and Test cricket. “In T20 there’s generally another game around the corner. You’re almost set up to fail a lot of the time, especially if you’re batting in the middle order. The tough thing with Test cricket is that if you get out early you’ve got a long time to think about it.“You guys have to write about it the Sky commentators have to fill time and they can pick you to pieces. In T20 you just move on to another game two days later. In cricket you fail in your head maybe seven or eight times out of 10. You’re always dealing with failure, which makes it such a tough game to master mentally.”Buttler clearly understands how precarious the game can be and he would never claim to have cracked it. “I’ve only played two Test matches coming back so I’m not going to get too far ahead of myself.”His globetrotting on the T20 circuit over the past two years has also helped him. “I haven’t been kicking my heels, saying I’m a failure in Test cricket and regretting how it went.” But unlike Adil Rashid and Alex Hales, he has not been tempted to rule out returning to the most taxing form of the game, for which England are very grateful. Even in the helter-skelter world of the modern cricketer there is still time enough for Buttler to have a significant Test career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c54bdc967c0e191ad3da7737b9c8e5641e8ba8c/157_391_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b133b55879c802b7ffbba5beff012b37","title":"us pga tour deal marginalises sky sports discovery","story":"Sky Sports faces a battle to retain its status as the UK’s main broadcaster of the PGA Tour after a $2bn deal was announced between the golfing body and Discovery. Sky’s hold on rights has already been weakened by the loss last year of the PGA Championship, plus an ongoing battle with Augusta National regarding the Masters.The PGA Tour confirmed on Monday that all broadcast rights outside of the country will be handled in partnership with Discovery – the media conglomerate which controls Eurosport – from 2019 until 2030. The announcement covers 21 markets, including Australia, South Korea and\u0026nbspCanada.Sky’s contract to screen PGA Tour events runs until 2022, meaning nothing will change immediately. It must decide in the meantime whether to attempt a sub-licence agreement with what is essentially a direct rival or step back from one of its core sports.It opted not to comment on the news as revealed jointly from PGA Tour bases in New York and London, with insiders keen to point out the time due to run on the existing contract. Discovery has the potential to auction coverage on a territory‑by‑territory basis. A senior PGA Tour source would confirm only that the UK market will be “open to negotiation” in the future.Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said: “This is an exciting next step which presents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate and expand our media business outside the United States, better service our international broadcast partners, and drive fan growth with a deeply experienced strategic global partner.“Since 2007, the PGA Tour has negotiated all of its non-US broadcast rights deals on its own. The alliance between Discovery and the PGA Tour will capitalise on the two organisations’ expertise in managing international multi-platform rights and launching the new digital service.”The European Tour has an agreement with Sky which concludes at the end of this year.

Parents will be able to access their children’s activity reports from their own devices to understand and manage their browsing habits.“Some apps send us flurries of notifications trying to draw us in for fear of missing out,” said Apple’s senior vice-president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, speaking to a 6,000-strong audience at WWDC, Apple’s annual developer conference, at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose on Monday. “For some of us it’s become such a habit we don’t even recognise just how distracted we’ve become.”Screen Time will be available with iOS 12, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, which launches later this year.Other digital wellbeing features to launch with iOS 12 include enhancements to the “do not disturb” feature, including a bedtime mode that dims the display and hides all notifications from the lock screen until prompted in the morning.The new operating system will also let users control how notifications are delivered to reduce interruptions, including the ability to group together notifications or turn them off completely. Apple’s virtual assistant Siri will also make suggestions for notification settings based on which alerts people act upon.The focus on digital wellbeing comes at a time when technology companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple are being scrutinised for their use of habit-forming design practices that encourage people to spend more time on their devices, such as infinite scrolling, notifications and other behavioural “nudges”.Apple’s tools are very similar to those announced by Google last month at its own annual developer conference, Google IO. The latest version of Google’s mobile operating system, Android P, also comes with an “app dashboard” which allows users to set time limits on inidual apps as well as a wind-down mode before bedtime that stops notifications and turns the screen to greyscale.The company also doubled down on its commitment to privacy with the introduction of tools to prevent advertisers from tracking users of Apple devices from being tracked online.In a direct swipe at Facebook, Federighi explained how “like buttons and share buttons” and comment features can “be used to track you whether you click on them or not”.“This year we’re shutting that down,” he said, adding that people can interact with these features if they choose to, but they won’t be tracked by default on an Apple computer if they use the native Safari browser on the next version of its desktop operating system, macOS Mojave.The company is also clamping down on a technique called “fingerprinting” which allows advertisers to identify and track inidual web users based on the unique way their computer is set up, including the device, operating system and fonts they are using.“Mass-deployment of fingerprinting protection is a game-changer for privacy engineering, and for users,” said Dr Lukasz Olejnik, independent security and privacy researcher and consultant.This builds on Apple’s efforts announced in 2017 to restrict web cookies, which also allow advertising companies to track users across the internet. “Put simply, there are two big classes of tracking: cookies and fingerprinting,” added Olejnik. “It appears that Apple has set a goal to go after all techniques that may be used in third-party tracking. It’s an arms race and I believe Apple may be winning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d1f639caefac8cdab8a8d300ecedccde4d52f7/0_39_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e0608715f4688a578b6886fdb6580a","title":"apple wwdc 2018 keynote ios 12 iphone update macbook macos 1014 tim cook siri live","story":"Tim Cook and friends kick off ‘dubdub’ in California, with new Apple Watch features, Siri Shortcuts, new Animoji, group FaceTime, ARKit and moreAnd that’s it! Tim Cook comes back on stage to run through the previous updates, and give the standard rubric: updates will be available this autumn, and the developer betas will be available today.The show ends with a montage of video interviews with loved ones of app developers, including the backstory of Yelp, who are currently fighting Google in nearly every venue going over the latter’s monopoly power. Is that a pointed decision by Apple? Could be.“The fact that the Mac and iOS share so much technology has led people every year to ask us the question: are you merging macOS and iOS” Federighi asks, before offering a one-word answer: “No”.But, he notes, Mac users not only run Mac apps, but also web apps, and games – built on cross-platform tech. Why not also let them run iOS apps?In developer terms, this means that UIKit, the tools used to build iOS apps, will shortly be getting a Mac version. As I guessed below, News, Home, Stocks and Voice Memos are the test versions of that. Developers will get those tools in 2019, Federighi says. (There’s a notable lack of applause from a typically very cheery audience to this particular news. I’m not sure developers really wanted this feature.)The changes that came to the iOS app store are making their way to the Mac App store next, which is getting editorial content, autoplaying videos, and recommendations.More importantly, Apple has won round some big App Store holdouts, including Microsoft, Adobe, Panic and BBEdit.A big one: Apple is turning off Facebook’s ability to track users across the web through like buttons and comment feeds. Federighi doesn’t cite the social network by name, but reassures users that iOS’s intelligent tracking protection will now cover that content as well. If this is enabled by default, it could have a wide-ranging effect on the company’s ability to track its users.And the tracking protection is also making it harder for data companies “to uniquely identify your device and track you”, limiting the information about things like fonts and system configuration that third parties can find.Apple’s rolling out iOS-style permissioning to Mac apps, Federighi says. Apps will have to inidually gain permission to access things like the camera.Next up, Apple News, Stocks, Home and Voice Memos are launching on the Mac. There isn’t really much to say, here: it’s Apple News, Stocks, Home and Voice Memos, but on the Mac. This does suggest, though, that rumours of a crossover between iOS and macOS may be true – these apps do look very similar to the iPad versions. We’ll see.OK, so, dark mode wasn’t really the flagship feature. Next up is “desktop stacks”, which attempts to save people who keep all their files on the desktop from themselves: the hundreds of files you store there will now be simply and easily grouped by type.The Finder itself also gets a slight rehaul. A gallery view replaces the old coverflow, letting you cycle through (and lightly edit) files in the document manager itself.(As Federighi demonstrates a new screenshot tool, there’s also a glimpse of the new Safari which features real icons again, something users – well, me – have been calling for for a while.)Continuity, Apple’s name for the maciOS crossover features, gets a focus: Mac apps can now call directly to the camera on the phone, letting users take a picture automatically from apps such as Keynote.Finally, the Mac. First off, the name. With Apple having followed a California location naming theme since it ran out of cats, the company’s gone from the mountains to the desert: macOS 10.14 is called Mojave.The flagship consumer feature, Federighi demonstrates, is a dark mode. It makes your Mac dark. It looks good! It even changes the default desktop background from a daytime shot of the desert to a night-time one.Watch down, AppleTV next – looks like macOS is being saved for last, which suggest that something macOS-related might be dropped as a trademark “One More Thing”. Not much to report, though most of the work on Apple TV still seems to be behind-the-scenes, as Apple hammers out content deals:On to connectivity – a function of the Apple Watch that the company has downplayed in recent years, in favour of focusing more on the health and fitness tracking.The leading feature here is a walkie-talkie mode, letting users talk back and forth using the watch like, well, a walkie-talkie. It looks quite fun, and potentially – for a device which is still very weird to use as a real phone – actually more useful than the calling feature.Beyond that, a grab-bag of new features:That’s it for iOS. The second hour begins with the Apple Watch, as Tim Cook hands over to Kevin Lynch, who starts by talking about the health and fitness features:Facetime, a much-loved feature that’s received little attention in recent years, is getting an update: group calls. A group can be as large as 32 people, which seems unwieldy, but certainly potentially useful. Tiles grow and shrink automatically depending on who’s talking.And, oh God, Animoji has made it into Facetime as well. This is nightmarish.Animoji is getting a new “tongue detection” ability, as though the creepiest feature from iOS 11 needed to get creepier. You can also personalise your own “memoji”. Animoji unsettle me on a visceral level. I think I’m in the minority here, though.You can also add iMessage stickers on to the camera app, and turn your head into an Animoji superimposed on to reality. I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it.Federighi back, and he’s turned to the “Time Well Spent” movement. “We might not recognise just how distracted we’ve become,” he says, in a not-so-subtle dig at social networks like Facebook and Twitter. So, three updates to help that. Firstly, Do Not Disturb During Bedtime will now deliberately not show you notifications if you open your phone at night, allowing you to check the time and get back to sleep without worrying. Do Not Disturb will also allow you to activate it on a timer, or leave it on until you leave an area.Secondly, the company is overhauling notifications, lifting one of Android’s best features, grouped notifications, letting those 47 WhatsApp updates get bundled together into one entry. And the new OS also lets you change your notification settings directly from the lock screen, from disabling noises to turning off notifications altogether. Siri will also suggest that you may want to disable some notifications if you don’t click on them for a while.Finally, a new Screen Time app offers you monitoring and insight on how much time you’re spending on your phone, and where you’re spending it – even down to how often you’re picking up your phone, and which apps are sending you the most notifications. You can also set app limits, voluntarily curtailing your time on the most habit-forming apps (a feature demonstrated through Instagram). That app will also be usable as a parental control toolbox, since parents can control their kids’ screen time in just the same way that adults can control their own.Federighi hands over to Susan Prescott for lightning updates to a few of Apple’s smaller apps, News, Stocks, Voice Memos, iBooks and CarPlay.News is getting some new views, and being incorporated into the Stocks app. The Stocks app is coming to the iPad. The Voice Memo app is also coming to the iPad, with a total visual redesign “and iCloud support so your recordings stay in sync across all your devices”.And iBooks is being renamed to Apple Books, with another visual redesign, bringing it in line with the App Store.Finally, CarPlay now supports 3rd-party navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze.Siri’s turn in the spotlight.

Anticor’s complaint accused Kohler of “influence-peddling”.On Monday, the financial prosecutor’s office confirmed that it had opened an investigation “to verify whether the rules relating to the private-sector activities of public officials have been respected”.Kohler was at the finance ministry, known in France as Bercy, between 2012 and 2016 the last two years as cabinet director to Macron, who was then the minister. He left the ministry in 2016 when Macron resigned from his post in François Hollande’s Socialist government to concentrate on the presidential election. Kohler then moved to Geneva to take up a position as financial director on MSC’s board.Kohler’s mother is a cousin of Rafaela Aponte, whose husband Gianlugi founded MSC in 1970. Mediapart has claimed that Kohler hid his family links to MSC from the parliamentary ethics commission.Mediapart also alleged that after leaving the finance ministry and becoming an executive of MSC in 2016, Kohler took part in at least one ministry meeting to discuss the fate of a STX, a French state-supported shipbuilding company and a major supplier to the Swiss-Italian shipping company, while he was advising Macron’s presidential campaign for free at the same time.Macron’s office issued a statement on Kohler’s behalf on Monday, in which it said the allegations were “completely unfounded” and based on “totally unfounded suspicions”.It added that Kohler, 45, would “communicate to prosecutors all documents proving his respect of the law during his professional life”, it said in a statement.“Mr Kohler would like to point out that he has always kept his superiors informed of the personal links he had with MSC,” it added. “As a result, he has systematically been removed from all deliberation and all decisions relating to this enterprise.”Kohler, a discreet figure who prefers to remain out of the spotlight, is often portrayed in the French media as the president’s twin brother.Macron appointed him as the Elysée Palace’s secretary general – or chief of staff – after winning the presidential election in May 2017. He is one of Macron’s most trusted aides and a key player in his ambitious reform programme. Both men are graduates of the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA), the hothouse for French public servants. Under French law, civil servants can take a break from public sector jobs to work in the private sector for a specified number of years. They can then return to public service.After a preliminary investigation, the prosecutor may decide to drop the case or open an official inquiry.

But one senator called the act “a despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority”.Duterte sought a kiss from the woman after he called her on stage to give her a copy of a book at the event in Seoul. When Duterte asked if she could explain to her husband that the antic was just a joke, and she said yes, the president leaned in and kissed her as thousands erupted in cheers.The scene was broadcast live by the state-run TV network to the Philippines.The woman has defended the kiss and said she was thrilled by her encounter but others said the president went too far.“President Duterte acted like a feudal king who thinks that being the president is an entitlement to do anything that he pleases,” said Sen Risa Hontiveros. “Even if the act was consensual, it was the president, possessed of awesome, even intimidating, power, who initiated it.”Gabriela, a leftwing women’s party, condemned Duterte’s act, which it said underscored his “machismo and misogyny”. In addition to growing alarm over his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs, which has left thousands of mostly poor drug suspects dead, Duterte has come under fire from women’s groups for sexist remarks, including one where he told troops to shoot female insurgents “in the vagina” during a public outburst against communist guerrillas.He has publicly kissed women in the past, included at rallies during his campaign for the presidency.The latest incident came near the end of a two-hour rambling speech, when Duterte offered the crowd a book about alleged corruption and abuse in the Catholic church. He pointed at two women.“There’s payment for this, a kiss. You in white, are you ready to engage in kissing? Come here,” the 73-year-old Duterte said as summoned the women to the stage.One of the women gave the president a peck on the cheek. The other woman reached for the president’s hand and put it on her forehead in a traditional gesture of respect for an elder. But the president asked her to come closer for a kiss, pointing to his lips.Amid the roar of the crowd, Duterte asked the woman was married and if her husband was around. He inquired if she could explain to her husband that what they were about to do was just a joke.She said her husband was not there and replied yes to the president’s other question.“Make him jealous,” the president said.Duterte then leaned in and kissed the visibly overwhelmed woman, who screamed in joy and covered her face. He then hugged her.“Don’t take that seriously,” Duterte later told the crowd. “It’s just to give people fun.”The woman, who is married to a South Korean and has two daughters, later said in a TV interview that she was thrilled by her encounter with the president. She said there was “no malice” in the kiss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

He accepted that the Government was juggling many issues ranging from Brexit to homelessness but said it could not simply “ignore the issue of insurance costs or see it as a battle won just because fewer people are getting a jaw-dropping increase when their renewal notice arrives”.He said despite falls in insurance costs reported by the Central Statistics Office, the average motorist still pays about 30 per cent more than in 2015. “The actions that Government need to take to ease the burden have been highlighted routinely and, in fact, many of the recommendations in the Cost of Insurance Working Group’s report reflected the suggestions of the AA and other organisations. “Unfortunately, since the report’s publication we haven’t seen enough follow through and it appears that the report is now simply gathering dust on a shelf somewhere in the Department of Finance. ”The high price of car insurance is not the only thing adding to motorists’ costs as fuel prices are now at their highest level in three years.The pricing website pumps.ie has put the average cost of a litre of petrol at €1.46 with the price of a litre of diesel now standing at €1.35. Among the key contributors to rising prices at the pump has been the volatile nature of the cost of a barrel of crude oil throughout this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519397.1528140994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city council spent over 15m on overtime in 2017","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCllr Mannix Flynn: called for more scrutiny of overtime payments. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDublin City Council spent more than €15.5 million on overtime costs last year. The council said 2,814 staff received overtime payments last year, and environment and transportation staff, such as road workers and street cleaners, accounted for more than €5.7 million of the bill.Firefighters accounted for €4.4 million, while housing and community staff made up €3.4 million of the costs. The overtime bill for last year is slightly down on 2016, which was €16.4 million, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The culture, recreation and economic services department accounted for €1.3 million. The chief executive department (€124,168), finance department (€50,713), human resources (€33,374) and law department (€14,141) also featured in the list of overtime costs. Dublin City Council said the working of overtime is approved only when there is no alternative and when circumstances arise that make it essential. “The need for overtime typically arises in the delivery of services in operational departments, including emergency services,” a spokeswoman said. “These services are delivered by a range of council employees in a variety of grades.” The overtime bill for the council is 4 per cent of its total payroll costs. Dublin councillors approved a budget of €917 million last November for running the capital this year, the largest city budget since 2009 and €54 million higher than in 2017. More than €142 million was set aside to provide homeless services this year. Independent councillor Mannix Flynn called for more scrutiny of overtime payments. “I think when you have an emergency situation and you have staff from the fire brigade attending issues, you can envisage that and you put by these contingency plans and emergency budgets. But everything is being rolled into this overtime budget,” he said. “I don’t want to see overtime being used as a topping-up of a salary and this is what happened during the bust.” Cllr Flynn said he believed Dublin City Council was not managing the city as well as it could be. “I’m not confident and I’m certainly not convinced about where this money is being spent and who it’s being spent on. I’ve called for an absolute breakdown of exactly where this money is being spent and where is the overtime incurred. I want to know who the top earners of overtime were.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519394.1528140985!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government finalises new ambassador appointments","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Villa Spada which houses the Chancery of Embassy of Ireland to the Holy See and is also the official residence of the Ambassador of Ireland to the Holy See.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyNearly two million Britons expected to

be accidentally decapitated in her mother\u0027s womb has been found guilty of medical misconduct.Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position, but instead tried to carry out a natural delivery.When the doctor urged the patient to push whilst she applied traction to the baby\u0027s legs, the head became detached in the mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a c-section to remove the head, which was re-attached to his body so that his mother could hold him.The tribunal said it accepted that by the time the head became detached, during the bungled delivery at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, in March 2014, the baby was already dead.Dr Laxman, who qualified in India before coming to the UK in 2004, denied any wrongdoing at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, and said she believed the baby would have died had a c-section been carried out.Ninewells Hospital in DundeeBut at a “finding of facts” the panel chairman Tim Bradbury said it was her decisions and her “increasingly desperate” attempts to deliver the head that caused the decapitation.He added: “…the central issue in this case is whether Dr Laxman\u0027s decision to attempt a vaginal delivery of Baby B rather than an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic was clinically indicated, or whether the only proper course in the circumstances would have been to proceed to an immediate caesarean section.Dr Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.”The tribunal also said she should have assumed a c-section would have no prospect of success.The chairman added: “The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.The tribunal heard that the mother’s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and her baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.Mr Bradbury said the body was delivered without difficulty, but the head became trapped in the uterus, with the neck in the cervix.He added: There then followed what was to become, in the tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.Dr Laxman in Manchester“Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body.”He also said that as the patient was only 4cm dilated it should have indicated to Dr Laxman that it was “insufficient” to deliver the baby’s head.Mr Bradbury said: Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.Dr Laxman will face further hearings to determine whether she should be struck off.Nearly two million Britons expected to question their gender, health boss warns NHSLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVComment: MPs rail at Grayling while the railways are failingFormer New Zealand sex worker made a dame in Queen\u0026#39s honours listNorman Scott says he may complain to police watchdog over bungled Jeremy Thorpe investigationBrexit bulletin: How lifting the cap on foreign doctors helps \u0026#39Global Britain\u0026#39 US Supreme Court rules in favour of Colorado baker who refused to make gay wedding cakeFrance starts work on revolutionary \u0026#39Alzheimer\u0026#39s village\u0026#39 where patients roam almost freeBavaria could use private jets to deport migrants in bid to pressure Angela Merkel over liberal policiesCrystal Palace captain Jason Puncheon told doorman to \u0026#39buy a house\u0026#39 with belt he tried to whip clubbers with, court hears\u0026#39Sin tax\u0026#39 looms on tobacco and alcohol in Nigeria as fears grow of a public health crisis Italy\u0026#39s new government in diplomatic row after accusing Tunisia of sending \u0026#39convicts\u0026#39 in migrant boats\u0026#39Miracle cure\u0026#39 saves woman with breast cancer given months to live France accused of double standards after \u0026#39heroic\u0026#39 Tunisian who saved children from flames to be deportedWorld Environment Day: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionSaudi Arabia grants first female driving licences ahead of ban liftMelania Trump will not travel to Singapore summit or G7Comment: Male writers are too busy patting each other on the back to notice that women are funny We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000165069605_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"eus centre disintegrating face populist surge might happen","story":"A protest in Germany depicts the populist leaders of Poland and Hungary, which are part of the Visegrad group, which has turned to populist Euroscepticism with deep concerns about migrationGeorge Soros, the billionaire financier and champion of liberal values in Europe, has warned that the disintegration of the European Union is “no longer a figure of speech” but has become a “harsh reality”.With populist governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland now in open revolt against western EU values - not to mention the leading anti-immigration SDS party comfortably topping the polls in the  Slovenian election over the weekend -

The IATA expects airlines to report a collective net profit of $33.8bn in 2018, and said this would be a “a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle”. The US central bank raised interest rates in March, and the Bank of England is widely expected to hike rates in the coming months.In addition, oil prices have been climbing in recent weeks, and in May broke past the $80 per barrel mark for the first time in three and a half years after President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The IATA said it expects the full-year average cost of Brent crude oil to be $70 per barrel, up 27.5 per cent from the average of $59.40 per barrel in 2017, while jet fuel prices are set to rise 25.9 per cent to $84 per barrel. The forecast net profit for this year has been revised down from a previous estimate of $38.4bn, and the IATA’s expected 2018 profit would also come in well below the record $38bn reported by airlines last year.The group also said operating profits, “though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs”.Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO, said: “Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. “At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors.”Meanwhile, growing uncertainty about global affairs “could present risks to the industry’s outlook”, according to the IATA. The group said particular risks included the advancement of political forces pushing a protectionist agenda, uncertainty following the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and a lack of clarity on the impact of Brexit.“Aviation spreads prosperity and enriches the human spirit. That truth lays the foundation for a very important message. The world is better off when borders are open to people and to trade. And our hard work as an industry has primed aviation to be an even stronger catalyst for an ever more inclusive globalization,” said Mr de Juniac.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Humans themselves even interbred with Neanderthals at some point in history, with many modern humans still carrying traces of\u0026nbspNeanderthal\u0026nbspDNA\u0026nbspin their genes.This new discovery is significant as it means there is yet another member of the great ape family with whom humans might share a common ancestor.Unfortunately the DNA fragments discovered within the bonobo only amount to roughly 3 per cent of the extinct ape\u0027s genome, making learning specifics about the new species\u0026nbspdifficult.Finding physical remains\u0026nbspis also unlikely because of the length of time involved, with Mr\u0026nbspKuhlwilm\u0026nbsprating the odds of finding an intact sample\u0026nbsplow.The ghost chimps\u0026nbspwould have died out long before Homo sapiens came on the scene around 300,000 years ago.Changes in environment have often forced\u0026nbspdifferent species to interbreed.Scientists have started witnessing\u0026nbspgrizzly bears and polar bears create offspring as climate change forces their natural environments closer to one another.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

At the time, it was reported that a new solution would be ready by March 2019, but the timetable appears to have slipped again, with no date now set for completion.Former transport secretary Lord Adonis said the government’s planning had been “ostrich-like”, while a spokesperson for Highways England said they would attempt to avoid disruption.If Britain cannot reach a deal with the European Union it will crash out in March 2019 with no transition period and will immediately face customs checks and paperwork for the millions of trucks that pour off ferries and Channel Tunnel shuttles every year.In recent weeks the Department for Transport unveiled contingency plans to convert part of the M20 motorway carriageway into a lorry park as a temporary stopgap – causing huge disruption to motorists and freight.The threat of a no deal\u0026nbspis looming larger than ever in Brussels, with no significant progress for months, issues thought to be settled in December rearing their heads again, and EU officials describing the UK’s approach as “fantasy”.Lord Adonis, a supporter for the Best For Britain anti-Brexit campaign, told The Independent that Britain was being left “dangerously vulnerable” by the government’s lack of preparations.“This failure to invest in – or prepare for – Brexit is emblematic of a government that seems incapable of taking its own policies seriously,” he said.“These delays may well end up causing queues of lorries for miles and miles, clogging up Kent and beyond and causing shortages of goods in our supermarkets.“This is just one of a number of areas where the government’s ostrich-like behaviour is leaving Britain dangerously vulnerable. I have just visited Rotterdam to see for myself the chaos that Brexit will cause our international trade.”Though Brexiteers have been keen to stress that they are leaving the EU rather than Europe, there are a number of major physical changes that will be need to be made in time for the UK’s departure whether or not a deal is reached.Theresa May has ruled out membership of the single market and customs union, meaning traders will face customs and regulatory checks upon entering the UK from Europe. This will require the expansion of physical infrastructure at ports and airports. Though the government wants a two-year transition period to give it time to prepare for Brexit, there will be none in the event of a “no deal”.As part of the preparations, the Highways Agency says it wants to “develop one or more lorry-holding areas to reduce the congestion in Kent caused by cross-Channel disruption”, with the M20 and M2 motorways into Dover the focus of expansion.\u0026nbspThe new infrastructure is at the very early planning stage, however.The Highways Agency does not mention Brexit in its consultation document on the new lorry parks, referring euphemistically instead to “disruptive events” that could cause them to be needed.Road infrastructure in the region already regularly goes over capacity in the event of poor weather or industrial action, and Kent Police have developed an approach called Operation Stack where part of the M20 motorway is converted into a temporary lorry park. The procedure has been implemented dozens of times in the last few decades.As well as the planned construction work on the south coast, the Home Office also revealed at the end of March that it was facing the task of recruiting an extra 1,000 border staff for Brexit.Other countries that see a lot of trade with Britain are also making similar preparations. The Netherlands is recruiting over 700 customs officers for the port of Rotterdam and Schipol airport, major hubs that connect the UK to world markets. The port of Rotterdam itself predicts 9km of traffic jams on its side of the channel in the event of a “no deal” scenario.A consultation document drawn up by the Highways Agency says: “Forecasts tell us that trafﬁc is expected to increase on the M20A20 and M2A2. The number of lorries travelling to and from the Kent ports is also expected to increase significantly.“Since severe weather, equipment failure and other disruptive events can never be completely avoided, the risk is that Operation Stack will be implemented more frequently if action is not taken. Without action, the safety and journey time reliability of everybody using the motorways, major and local roads in Kent is likely to be affected.”A Highways England spokesperson said: “We are clear that the disruption that people in Kent suffered in summer 2015 should never happen again.“We are starting a public information exercise soon which will take a completely fresh look at long term solutions for Operation Stack and will ask people living, travelling and working in Kent for their views on what they’d like to see. The date these measures will be in place will depend on what option is chosen.“In the meantime, we are taking steps to increase the resilience of the road network, including a contraflow on the M20 which will be available for use early next year. This will increase the options available if there is the need to deal with any potential disruption.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In most circumstances, if\u0026nbspone dies, quits or\u0026nbspretires then the successor is voted for by members of their own party.Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found that the average electorate for normal hereditary by-election\u0026nbspis only 32 voters, with only 29 people usually turning out.The group\u0026nbspfound that four by-elections had more candidates than electors in recent years – including a by-election for Labour hereditary peers with\u0026nbsp11 candidates and only three voters.Some 3,190 votes have been cast in the last 32 by-elections, which began in 2003, compared to the last 32 Commons by-elections, where 931,725 votes have been cast.ERS chief executive\u0026nbspDarren Hughes\u0026nbspsaid: “These so-called by-elections are an undemocratic farce – and make mockery of our democracy.“This time, around 25 peers are set to decide which aristocrat remains in parliament to vote on our laws, for the rest of their lives. “That is not democracy – and it’s time we ended this bizarre hangover from feudal times. \u0026nbsp“It’s vital for trust and faith in our democracy that the forthcoming farce of a by-election – brought about by the retirement of Earl Baldwin of Bewdley – will be the last. “The public should decide who votes on our laws – not a tiny clique of aristocrats.”Labour peer Lord Grocott\u0026nbspis trying to axe the by-elections through a private members’ bill but his efforts were blocked by a handful of hereditary peers in March.However,\u0026nbspConservative frontbencher Lord Young of Cookham\u0026nbspsaid the government “will not obstruct” his bill and offered it more parliamentary time.Lord Grocott\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“These were only supposed to be a temporary measure but it’s now gone on for 19 years.“There have been 32 hereditary by-elections, so I mean that’s a third of all hereditary peers who have been replaced. It’s ridiculous.“You have this situation where the government is trying to reduce the size of the Lords and the House of Commons but you have 92 peers who cannot be touched.”Only one woman is eligible to stand in the upcoming by-election out of more than 200 candidates, and just 31 peers will be able to vote, according to a written parliamentary question to Lord Grocott.The poll will also cost taxpayers more than £1,140 to stage.Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the issue was “another reminder of how archaic, undemocratic and outdated” the Lords is.“Liberal Democrats have long argued for an elected upper chamber, but sadly attempts to introduce reform were thwarted by the self-interest of the other two parties,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Isn’t it ironic, however, that murmurs from the Tories have changed in recent weeks as a result of the Lords defeating them on the EU Withdrawal Bill on fifteen occasions?”Lord Fowler, the Lords speaker, has welcomed efforts to slash the size of the upper chamber\u0026nbspafter a key Lords committee\u0026nbsprecommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in numbers.\u0026nbspA Lords spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The House of Lords recognises the need for reform and, following a report from the Lord Speaker’s committee on the size of the house in October 2017, showed overwhelming\u0026nbspsupport for reducing and capping the size of the house, and for linking new appointments to general election results.”It comes after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspaccused of\u0026nbsp“hypocrisy” after appointing nine new Tory peers to the House of Lords, including several ex-ministers, despite promising that senior politicians would not receive automatic ennoblement.Her announcement coincided with the eve of the royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, prompting claims that the prime minister had tried to\u0026nbspsneak out the news when it would receive little attention.Candidates for the upcoming by-election will be announced on 15 June, with the count on 4 July.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All London boroughs have signed up to the online resource, which also seeks to help people find affordable homes.The mayor’s\u0026nbsprevised housing strategy also includes an additional £1.67bn of affordable housing investment the mayor secured from government earlier this year. The “majority” of this will be spent on new homes on social rent levels, the mayor said.In April the mayor said work started on a “record” 12,500 affordable\u0026nbspproperties in 2017-18, up from\u0026nbsp6,725 in 2016-17.Regardless, questions have been raised about Mr Khan’s ability to tackle the size of the capital’s housing crisis, since\u0026nbspprivate developers have proved reluctant to build large quantities of affordable homes.Despite Mr Khan’s objections, a\u0026nbspdevelopment of 700 homes in Ilford\u0026nbspincluded just 4 per cent\u0026nbspaffordable housing. The borough has a policy where 50 per cent of all new homes should be affordable.Mr Khan’s demand that a social housing tenant be appointed\u0026nbspcommissioner\u0026nbspcame after evidence\u0026nbsphearings in\u0026nbspthe Grenfell\u0026nbspTower inquiry began\u0026nbspon Monday. Expert reports released on the morning documented a catalogue of serious safety breaches that contributed to the blaze that killed 72 people.More than 150 social tower blocks across England have been found to have aluminum\u0026nbspcomposite material (ACM) cladding, blamed for spreading the fire in north Kensington in the early hours of 14 June.Yet\u0026nbspthe latest statistics have revealed only 10 of those high-rises have had the panelling replaced.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is the only politician from the right of the political spectrum to have led the country since the end of the First World War.If the right-wingers successfully form a government they would shift the balance of power on the European Council further to the populist right just as Italy, previously governed by a centre-left prime minister, gains a far-right coalition government.“I am not obliged to award the mandate to the relative winner of the election, but I will do so because I strongly believe in democracy,” president Borut Pahor told local media.It may prove difficult for Mr Janša’s party to form a majority in the highly fragmented field of parties, however. Preliminary results show the group came top by winning just 25 per cent of the vote and 25 out of 90 seats in the country’s parliament – with ideologically similar coalition partners thin on the ground in the historically progressive country.The far-right Slovenian nationalist party, a potential partner, has just four seats, while the Christian Democrats have seven – with practically all the other parties adhering to different flavours of liberalism or socialism. A pensioners interests party which won five seats participates in the outgoing government.A broad coalition of liberals and social democrats could hold a majority but would need at least five parties to participate in order to reach a majority.Right-wing nationalist parties have come to power in Hungary, Poland, Italy and Austria in recent years, representing a new bloc of largely anti-immigrant politics at a European level.Last week the far-right League party and their allies the anti-establishment Five Star Movement came to power in Italy on a promise to deport irregular migrantsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called A Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/as-graphic-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"liam fox brexit power britain","story":"Why? Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

The manoeuvre caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached, leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head.It was ”re-attached” to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is believed the child was already dead before he was decapitated during the 15-minute delivery.Mr Tim Bradbury, chairing the tribunal, said: “The tribunal found that the breech extraction and consequent use of traction was necessitated by Dr Laxman’s earlier decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery and which is the subject of the tribunal’s finding.“Laxman’s conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation.“But for Laxman’s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.”He added that Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The womans waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mothers cervix was between 2-4cm dilated.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm.She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later while discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker.She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her too push.Last month consultant Laxman, who denied misconduct, said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out during the procedure on March 16 2014.She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester: “I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby.I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”Laxman qualified as a doctor in Chennai, India, in 1999.The mother – known only as Patient A – came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: “I don’t forgive you – I don’t forgive you” as the doctor stared down at the floor.The patient then looked away as Laxman’s QC apologised on her behalf.The mother added: “I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated.“I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn’t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.“Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman remains fit to continue practicing as a doctor."},{"url":null,"title":"russian tv news photoshops smile onto kim jong un as he meets top moscow official to make him appear happier","story":"The dictator met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday, just weeks before a planned meeting between the US and the North Korean regime.Although Kim did crack a smile during other parts of the meeting, the photos and footage of the moment he posed for the cameras during a handshake with Lavrov show him stony-faced.But a segment about the meeting during the programme News of the Week on pro-Putin TV station Russia 1 featured a still of Kim smiling alongside Lavrov.A photo of the same moment published on the official Twitter of the Russian Foreign Ministry also shows Kim looking grim-faced.Bloomberg Moscow deputy bureau chief Scott Rose tweeted: “Russian state TV, rising to the occasion, photoshopped a smile onto North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at his meeting with Lavrov.”The host of the show is Dmitry Kiselyov, who has been called a Putin propagandist and claims the US is in league with terror group ISIS.Lavrov became the first top-ranking Russian to meet with the current head of North Korea.The pair met ahead of the much talked about meeting between Trump and Kim scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.The Foreign Minister reportedly invited Kim Jong-un to Russia.In return Kim thanked him for the invitation and asked him to convey his greetings to Vladimir Putin and the Russian people.Russia 1 has been contacted for a comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict0004107702471.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m1 underpass blocked travellers rubbish","story":"Shocking photographs show how litter has completely blocked the underpass at junction 12 near Flitwick, Beds.And at 2pm, motorists driving vans were seen towing caravans from the site and police said no arrests had been made.It is unclear whether the group will be investigated after the mess was left by the roadside.Bedfordshire Council is now expected to be left with a huge bill as they begin the mammoth task of cleaning the area.It comes after taxpayers spent a staggering £57million in 2017 to clean fly-tipping sites around the country.Highways England today said they had staff down at the site and are looking at how long it will take to clear.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “Highways England served notice last week on a group of travellers at junction 12 of the M1 for them to move on, giving them until today.“They are now in the process of moving away from this site.“Highways England has now been able to get staff on site and have requested for our contractors to attend urgently to assess the situation, provide an estimate for when it can be cleared by and the cost of this.“We already collect vast amounts of litter from motorways and major trunk roads every year, but we’d much rather be spending our time carrying out other essential maintenance work.“Fly-tipping causes a hazard to drivers, our workers, the community and wildlife, and we will look to recover costs of this where possible.”Councils are hoping to crack down on fly-tipping and have said that those that do could be prosecuted.Penalties for fly-tipping were increased after the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.It is now a criminal offence and those who are found guilty face a fine of up to £50,000 or 12 months’ imprisonment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000407541881.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle joins queen royal engagements without harry","story":"The new Duchess of Sussex will accompany the Queen at a theatre opening and a lunch in Chester next week.The pair will have a jam-packed schedule as the 36-year-old new royal and her grandmother-in-law will also open the Mersey Gateway Bridge.This will be Meghans first official event without Prince Harry by her side.The newly married couple havent been seen in public since Prince Charles 70th birthday bash -

Official figures requested by Tim Roache’s GMB union from the Office for National Statistics shine a public light on a dirty secret well-heeled, bad bosses and a Conservative Government want ignored: low wages, long hours and poor conditions are killers.

It is up to the Speaker who is hauled before the Commons but you suspect Chris Grayling will be requested to account for the meltdown in the railways, especially in the north of England .   MPs are also pushing for an emergency debate on abortion in Northern Ireland – the Downing Street line this is a devolved matter is looking increasingly tenuous – and a statement on the looming trade war with the United States.   Someone may also chance his or her arm and call for a statement on the leaked papers showing the doomsday consequence of walking away from the EU without a deal.   Then there is Sajid Javid’s re-writing of Theresa May’s immigration policy - the cap on skilled workers looks set for scrap heap.        Sitting in the middle of this swirling storm of problems, her cagoule pulled tightly over her face, is our besieged Prime Minister.   Mrs May has received plaudits for her resilience but the paralysis at the heart of government is a reminder of her limitations.   She is an over-promoted municipal politician who would struggle to make a decision on planning permission for a conservatory let alone something as all-encompassing as Brexit.   We should not be surprised the Department for Brexit has game planned a no deal scenario and concluded it would be disastrous.   Anyone who has half an eye on the Brexit understood the implications of falling back on World Trade Organisation rules without resolving hundreds of issues ranging from our membership of the European medicines agency to the collection of VAT on foreign imports.   Brussels has been aware of this from the off which is why they always knew Mrs May’s ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ was posturing.   With time pressing and Cabinet differences apparently insoluble, the greater the likelihood that it will be left to Parliament to determine what sort of Brexit we have.   Having campaigned to take back control Brexiteers are in no position to complain about this.   And there was a strong argument that Mrs May should have taken a more consensual route in the first place.   But it does mean Downing Street and the Cabinet are struggling to keep control of events which adds to the uncertainty that so unnerves business.   This is a message the bosses of leading firms will convey when they meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street today.

The 59-year-old says she had consulted with neighbours before installing the \u0026pound2,500 home improvement. Under council law, any decking more than 30 centimetres above the ground requires planning approval. Ms Duffy\u0027s was around 70 centimetres high. The ex-council worker was staggered when she found out a neighbour had complained about the decking and that she was being taken to court for breaching local planning rules.  Retrospective planning permission and subsequent appeals were both refused on the grounds of the impact on neighbouring residents in Westhoughton, Greater Manchester. Ms Duffy was fined and ordered to reinstate the decking to its maximum permitted height. Despite complying with the ruling, the retired former Bolton Council employee says she has been left disappointed and bewildered by the prosecution. Ms Duffy pleaded guilty to the offence at Bolton Magistrates Court last week and was handed a conditional discharge.  She was also ordered to pay \u0026pound125 towards the council\u0027s investigation, a \u0026pound200 contribution towards costs and a \u0026pound20 victim\u0027s surcharge. Ms Duffy said the decking was first installed in June 2016 without objection after consulting with neighbours. A court heard she had consulted with her neighbours on either side who were happy the decking would enhance the area at the back of her home. But it came as a shock when another neighbour complained about the decking.  Prosecutor Marcus Hirst told the court Ms Duffy had failed to respond to a letter sent in February this year requesting further information about how the enforcement notice had been complied with. She was prosecuted by Bolton Council for failing to comply with regulations. Ms Duffy told a court she had not deliberately broken the rules, as she believed the platform was at ground level - and had delayed lowering while seeking further advice. She has since had the platform lowered from 70 centimetres to the 30 centimetres permitted together with a step up - at a cost of more than \u0026pound300.  Speaking after the hearing, Ms Duffy said: Unfortunately I had it done too high, I didn\u0027t realise I had to have planning permission for decking. I realise I didn\u0027t comply, but my factors were I didn\u0027t know what was considered ground level, I thought my house was at ground level, I didn\u0027t realise planning would be needed. The aim was to make the garden more accessible as I have friends with mobility problems, I didn\u0027t wilfully break the law. I spent \u0026pound900 on planning consultants to give me advice and I put in another planning application, but unfortunately that didn\u0027t come to fruition.  Ms Duffy said she felt she had valid reasons for not complying with the enforcement notice sooner: I was surprised, I think it\u0027s nonsense, but I have to say I was found guilty of not complying with an enforcement notice. I\u0027m surprised it went to these lengths as it\u0027s decking we\u0027re talking about. The reason I didn\u0027t think I should have put an application in is that, to me, it\u0027s at ground level. I admit I didn\u0027t comply with the enforcement notice, but I was making further investigations and taking further advice to backup my views and if I could keep the decking.

Michael Pieridis told DerbyshireLive the massive explosion went off just two floors above his flat at Norman House.  He said: It was a massive boom. Everyone ran in fear, we gathered our clothes and our phone and just got out of there. We were all desperately banging on doors getting everyone out. It was so scary.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position. But she instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally before tragedy struck when the doctor urged the patient to push whilst herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman. Measures were taken so the mother could hold her son before saying goodbye.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, consultant Laxman who qualified in Chennai, India, denied wrongdoing saying she believed the baby would have died had a caesarean section been carried out.  But at a finding of facts hearing panel chairman Tim Bradbury said: It was Dr Laxman\u0027s decision in this regard that was to dictate her subsequent actions and the course of events which ultimately led to Baby B being decapitated. \u0027The Tribunal was in no doubt that throughout her involvement in the attempted delivery of Baby B, she was endeavouring to achieve the best outcome for Patient A and Baby B. Mr Bradbury went on to explain how Dr Vaishnavy Laxman had not thought through the consequences of a natural delivery. He concluded: The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time. The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.   Man \u0027ashamed of having fourth child\u0027 kisses newborn baby goodbye before abandoning infant in church  Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical. Later whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker. She then carried out an examination of the woman and told her to push. Mr Bradbury added: Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.

They\u0027ve been kicking a stag do off for pretty much the whole time. Arrggghhh. Nathan responded: Hi mate was my stag party. Gutted on what happened. Sorry about the flight but we all know that head flight attendant had a big stick up the a*** and didn’t want us on the flight from the word go. #joke. However, it seems that Nathan did eventually make it to Prague to celebrate his stag do, just a day later than planned. On Saturday, Nathan\u0027s friend Ben Grzesica, 31, wrote on Facebook: Well we finally got here, let\u0027s get this stag trip underway #take2. Nathan is set to marry long-term girlfriend Stephanie Lewis, 31, from Treharris in Wales. There has been confusion as to why the flight actually had to be cancelled. Bristol Live report that it wasn\u0027t just the rowdy behaviour of a minority which led to the flight\u0027s cancellation.  While police and easyJet staff were delayed dealing with the disruption, the weather forecast developed. EasyJet released an initial statement about the incident which the company then updated late on Saturday evening. In the update a spokeswoman explained that it was the bad weather which ultimately led to the flight being cancelled - and around 140 people having to get off the plane before it had moved at Bristol Airport. However, it\u0027s thought that if there hadn\u0027t been bad behaviour, the flight might have been able to take off safely before the weather became an issue. An EasyJet spokesman said: EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. She went on to apologise for the effects on passengers and said it had done what it could to help those affected. The spokeswoman added: “EasyJet’s crew did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our remaining passengers who have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund.  EasyJet also provided hotel accommodation and meals for those passengers who required them. “Our crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.” A police officer, Nick Falconer, took to Twitter to share pictures of the police operation. The images show several police cars and officers at the side of the runway.

Despite this when the Daily Mirror received a dramatic telephone call at 10.15am on May 1, 1968 no-one could have predicted the tale which would emerge. A man said he wanted to talk about a friend and a serious crime. He was to solve a mystery which had baffled police who had been called to a countryside cottage where firefighters had found a body. The mystery caller said he would arrive at the office in about fifteen minutes. At 10.30am, the man arrived at the main door in London\u0027s Holborn and was shown to a third floor waiting room.  He was scruffily dressed and looked tired. In quiet, jerky sentences, he told about a crime that he said he knew had been committed. He said he had a friend who knew all about a murder and he was waiting at London Bridge railway station. At first, he would not give his name, but as details tumbled out he could not keep up his pretence. There is no friend, it is me, he confessed. He was 28-year-old Hungarian chef Imre Gathy, and he described how on the Saturday before he had left his wife and two young children, at home in Harrington Road, Brighton. He said he had rowed with his wife after losing his job and had set out to look for work.  As he walked out of the seaside town along the A23 towards Gatwick a car pulled up. Inside was a man who it later transpired was retired naval Lieutenant Commander Humphrey Gilbert Grace. Grace had had a religious conversion almost a decade before when his mother had died suddenly. While he was away at the funeral his younger son was blinded in one eye in an accident. Since then, he had developed a fondness for picking up down and outs and taking them back his family home while his wife was away.  On this weekend Mr Grace\u0027s wife and teenage daughter were on holiday in Greece and two sons at boarding school when he offered Gathy a lift. The 29-year-old got into the green 1965 Morris Mini-traveller and the pair drove off towards Gatwick. As they got near Gatwick, Gathy said he asked to be dropped off as he knew the manager of the airline canteen. But Grace said that he could call him from his nearby home, and so they drove to October House. Once inside Gathy said he had a wash and called his friend at Gatwick Airport at 4pm, but it was his day off. He had tea with Grace, and, according to Gathy, the retired naval officer started to talk about God and read from the Bible until about 11pm.  Grace then showed his guest to a bedroom, which was a back room with a single bed where he slept until the morning. The next morning, Gathy said that he wanted to contact his wife, but claims that Grace said that he should let her wait adding that the man should wear the trousers. Reports at the time said that Gathy claimed later that Grace came out directly talking about the subject of homosexuality, saying that the Bible spoke of \u0027Love thy neighbour\u0027 - he took it to mean that you could love another man like your wife. He claimed Grace\u0027s response was to put his hand on the top of his leg. Gathy said he struck Grace with the back of his fist and that the older man jumped up and started shouting and screaming. He said that he then came towards him and he fell out of the back of his chair. Gathy said he grabbed a doorstop and hit the commander over the head - killing him. He said he panicked, and thinking he would make the crime look like a robbery, stole some silverware and fled back to Brighton. He twice tried to set fire to the house where he had killed Mr Grace, but the fire did not take and smoke was spotted by neighbours who alerted fire fighters who found the body. Gathy said he decided to hand himself in, but instead of going to the police station called the Daily Mirror to confess.

Carrie Hilton, whose daughter Clarice, 17, gave birth to a baby girl, Jessica, earlier this year, has spent \u0026pound13,000 on cosmetic surgery .  Now aged 36, she has thousands of social media followers and has had to fight off floods of marriage proposals from across the globe. A black belt kickboxer who has represented England six times in competitions, Carrie often posts risque photos of herself online.  As well as training numerous times a week, she has undergone breast implants, Botox and teeth bonds to preserve her youthful looks. But while she believes herself to be the globe\u0027s hottest gran, a 47-year-old woman in Australia also considers herself worthy of the title. Gina Stewart, a mum of four, underwent a procedure on her breasts a decade ago, but claims her looks are almost completely natural. She says she believes in ageing gracefully.   However, despite admitting that Gina looks good for her age, Carrie told MailOnline : I was dubbed \u0027Britain\u0027s most glamorous granny\u0027 in January and then the \u0027world\u0027s hottest granny\u0027 by various media outlets around the world shortly after (Clarice gave birth).  I\u0027m the hottest granny, there is no competition here. The mum-of-two, a media sales manager who lives in Bolton, Greater Manchester, has more than 13,000 followers on Instagram. Earlier this year, she described being inundated with messages after becoming famous for being one of the youngest grans in Britain.   She told the Daily Star at the time: I\u0027ve had lots of messages from admirers. Most of them asking for dates or sex.  I\u0027ve even had some people asking to marry me. She added that she had received messages from across the globe - some of which had been a bit racier than I\u0027d care to admit. “But to be honest I find it really flattering and think it\u0027s really lovely. I am a grandma after all! she said. Carrie also has a five-year-old daughter, Casey.

Chiltern Edge Secondary School in Oxfordshire has banned shorts from the uniform, insisting boys who are too hot in trousers should wear a skirt instead. The policy change comes as more schools across the country begin adopting more \u0027gender-neutral\u0027 approach to governing. A parent of a pupil at Chiltern Edge, Alastair Vince-Porteous, claimed he contacted the school to ask if his son could wear shorts, before being told his options were either full-length trousers or a skirt. Mr Vince-Porteous said: I was told shorts are not part of the uniform. It\u0027s a shame we can\u0027t be more grown up about it. We aren\u0027t asking for a rara skirt or skinny jeans, just tailored shorts for two months a year. It\u0027s not a big deal.   Another parent, Joanne Muday, said: It\u0027s nuts to make kids wear blazers and ties when it gets very hot., reports the Mail Online .  In August, Chiltern Edge Secondary School will become an Academy, meaning it can be governed more independently although remain state-funded. Their uniform policy change comes after the school was branded inadequate by Ofsted. Headteacher Moira Green said: In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success. Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform. The Oxfordshire school is far from the first to introduce similar uniform rules. In Birmingham, Allens Croft School became one of the first in the country to introduce a flexible uniform list, which did not differentiate between boys and girls.

The 65-year-old shopper was contacted by a cold-caller who claimed to be from the HMRC and threatened her with jail if she didn\u0027t pay missed taxes immediately. He then asked the woman, who remains anonymous, to purchase hundreds of pounds of iTunes vouchers from the Tesco store on Victoria Street - but she was luckily stopped from going through with it by staff who recognised the scam. The woman said: I was absolutely terrified. He said that I owed the government money which I needed to pay immediately or I would be arrested. He warned me that if I didn\u0027t do what he said, I could be fined \u0026pound96,000 and we could lose our house or my husband\u0027s car. He told me that if I spoke to anyone on the way, I would also be arrested.  The woman went to the shop, but luckily staff at Tesco realised what was happening thanks to widespread publicity about the scam and called the police, reports Grimsby Live . The woman continued: They asked me what the vouchers were for, and I told them it was for my grandchildren. When they asked again, I burst out crying and told them what was really happening. The store called the police and the manager even spoke with the conman on the phone, telling him to leave the woman alone. Shockingly, she was the second person who had been targeted that day, and the scammer had asked for even more from the other victim, who was also prevented from making the purchase. The woman said the incident has left her shaken.  She added: I have asthma, and my chest has been tight all day since it happened. If I\u0027d had a heart condition, it could have been much, much worse. The police warned residents earlier this month about scams involving gift cards or iTunes vouchers. A statement from the force said: We have received a number of recent reports of fraudsters contacting victims via telephone and demanding payment by way of gift card or iTunes vouchers. A recent victim gave away over \u0026pound200 by purchasing iTunes vouchers and providing the codes to the suspect.

Graham Stuart Dillon carried out a brutal process of torture towards his nine-year-old son, Bradyn Dillon, before his death in 2016. The youngster was callously burnt with cigarettes, punched in the stomach and hurled against a wall in the months before he died. He was also bashed in the head, with the violence often punishment for a real or imagined infraction of discipline, court documents state.  Little Bradyn, from Australia, died in hospital after being knocked unconscious by Dillon during his final attack in February 2016.    A court previously heard the child was hit and kicked in the face, which is believed to have made his old injuries bleed, ABC reports.  Dillon, 40, who had carried out the beating after Bradyn allegedly stole lollies from him, left his son to lie unconscious for hours. Instead of calling the emergency services, the father went on the Internet and searched what to do if someone is knocked out. Finally, an ambulance was called to the home in Jacka, Canberra. Bradyn was taken to hospital, where he tragically later died. He had suffered more than 60 injuries to his head and body following months of violence by his father, according to court papers.  The court heard his death was caused by his aggregated brain injuries. Last year, Dillon pleaded guilty to murdering Bradyn.  And now, he has been sentenced to 36 years for the murder, with a further five years added for grievous bodily harm and assault charges including choking and threatening to kill, according to 9 News .  He was sentenced at the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, where details of his shocking crimes were read out.  Justice John Burns said the defendant\u0027s conduct towards his son could aptly be described as torture, The Canberra Times reports.

In a landmark ruling, the justices, in a 7-2 decision, faulted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u0027s handling of the claims brought against Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, saying it had showed a hostility to religion. The commission said Phillips violated the Colorado anti-discrimination law which bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012.  But the court did not issue a definitive ruling on the circumstances under which people can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws based on their religious views. After being rebuffed by Mr Phillips, Mullins and Craig filed discrimination charges with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, who ruled in their favour. The case went to the Colorado Court of Appeals, who also ruled in favour of the couple, but Mr Phillips pushed the Supreme Court to take his case, which they agreed to do last summer. The Supreme Court heard arguments last December and large crowds of protesters gathered outside in support of the couple. Two of the court’s four liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, joined the five conservative justices in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1d637fac6.jpg ","title":"dundee people

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

international class visitor attraction promised for the castle should finally be unveiled after months of discussions.Currently the castle houses the courts, but these are being relocated to a purpose-built \u0026pound30 million justice centre under construction on land beside Burnett Road Police Station.The castle and Upper Bridge Street buildings are key components of the Courier\u0027 \"Reinvent the City\" campaign.It is thought a number of alternatives have been discussed to decide the type of visitor attraction the castle should hold.Highland planning director Stuart Black would not comment but has previously said: \"The aim is to create an international class visitor attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands.\"It will also act as a catalyst for wider regeneration of Inverness city centre as a gateway for Highland tourism.\"Monday 4 Jun 2018 9:38

I enjoyed Peru as well, it was brilliant and something that I’ll definitely learn from.”The Scots found it tough against the World Cup-bound Mexicans whose side contained the likes of ex-Barcelona and Tottenham player Giovani dos Santos, former Arsenal man Carlos Vela and Barcelona legend Rafael Marquez.The performance of Shinnie at left-back and Don Scott McKenna skippering the team in just his fourth cap were two positives.Shinnie added: “We were trying to keep our shape as best we could.“We knew that they would move and pass the ball about well so when we turned the ball over we were trying to keep it ourselves and get ourselves forward.“It was tough to do it, but when we did do it, especially second half, we had a good go.“We’re disappointed, Oli McBurnie has one off the post and we were desperate for it to go in.“But I think second half we definitely came into it more and got forward a lot more and created a lot more problems.”Conditions were gruelling with the stadium in Mexico City being 7,200 feet above sea level. Shinnie said: “It was tough, at one point in the first half I felt like I was swallowing sand.“It was good, it’s different experiences and it’s something that I’ll potentially never experience again.”Scotland boss Alex McLeish has been pleased with the trip to South America overall, despite the losses to both Peru and Mexico.The Gothenburg Great said: “The trip has been great, the players have been very professional.“Normally they would be on their holidays. We would love to be going to the World Cup the same as Mexico.“But we have played a couple of games that can help us build for the future.“It was a very tough game for us at altitude and in these conditions.“I think the players that we had out there did the country proud.“We are trying to get better on the technical side and we have asked the players to look at their game and be brave, to make passes and receive passes.“It’s a big part of the plan going forward.”One frustration for McLeish was Scotland’s lack of threat in attack.He added: “We looked to be more of a threat, to get players forward in the box. I felt that we never had the best of deliveries. When we got into wide areas, we hit the first man a lot when we had good presence in the box.“You saw when we got a good cross in the second half, McBurnie had a good header, he was unlucky he hit the post. In the first-half, we had crosses potentially for the strength of Callum Paterson but we didn’t quite succeed.“Both teams made changes, that can upset the rhythm of the game, but both teams did what they could to impress the fans and the coaches.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie and mckenna earn pass marks for scotland as manager mcleish takes first strides on road to lifting hopes of a nation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s Scott McKenna captaining Scotland was one of the few highlights from their 1-0 loss to Mexico.The Dark Blues finished their South American tour with defeat in the famous Azteca Stadium with the only real positives being McKenna as skipper and another solid display from Dons captain Graeme Shinnie who played the whole game.The superiority of the World Cup-bound Mexicans was clear with the Scots only creating one clear-cut opportunity in what was a largely forgettable 90 minutes for the Tartan Army as they watched a team lacking in creativity.The merits of Scotland’s trip to South America at the end of a long season have to be questioned – but the tour has been a successful one for the Dons in Alex McLeish’s squad.Pittodrie skipper Shinnie has finally been given his opportunity and he has shown what many of us have known for a while: that he is capable of playing at international level.While McKenna’s fairy tale continues.The 21-year-old had already had a dream season breaking into the Aberdeen team and winning his first two caps for the national side in March.But on this trip McKenna has doubled his tally to four and has now captained Scotland.Gothenburg Great McLeish seems keen to build his defence going forward into the Uefa Nations League and the European Championship qualifiers around McKenna.He clearly has total confidence in the youngster and for McKenna to skipper the Dark Blues in just his fourth cap is an incredible achievement and he was one of Scotland’s best performers in what was a disappointing display.He is following in the footsteps of Aberdeen legends like Martin Buchan, Willie Miller, McLeish and Jim Leighton in captaining his country.Seven changes were made to the side which lost 2-0 to Peru in Lima last Wednesday morning.Jordan Archer, Charlie Mulgrew, Lewis Stevenson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Jamie Murphy and Matt Philips dropped out.McLeish drafted in keeper Jon McLaughlin, Jack Hendry, Shinnie, Johnny Russell, Callum Paterson, former Dons loanee Ryan Christie and Oliver McBurnie to start.The changes were necessary due to the heat in the famous Azteca Stadium as well as the altitude, with the ground being 7,200 feet above sea level.But after only 13 minutes the Scots found themselves trailing.Edson Alvarez crossed from the right, Giovani dos Santos slipped the ball on to Carlos Vela just inside the area, he turned and Hendry’s slip allowed the former Arsenal man to square for Dos Santos who fired a low shot past McLaughlin from 18 yards with his left foot.The Scots were struggling to get the ball and string more than two passes together as the first period wore on.Former Aberdeen man Kenny McLean was the only player in Scotland’s midfield who seemed to have the confidence to try to keep possession and build attacks.Mexico could have doubled their lead just before the half hour when Miguel Layun’s 25-yard curler came back off the right post.McLaughlin made a decent save from Hirving Lozano’s long-range effort as the one-way traffic towards Scotland’s goal continued.At the start of the second period sub keeper Scott Bain made saves from Lozano and Hector Herrera in the opening 70 seconds.Then on 49 minutes McBurnie hit the right post with a powerful header from 10 yards after Russell crossed from the right.After not creating a chance in the first half this was more promising from the Scots.But on 53 minutes they were fortunate not to concede when Mexico broke at speed from a Scotland corner.At the end of the move Vela was free and could have shot but opted to cut back for Layun, but Shinnie and Bain smothered his effort.Scotland were given another let-off with 25 minutes left when Lozano blasted off the crossbar from 10 yards after getting away from sub Charlie Mulgrew.Sub Oribe Peralta had the ball in the Scots net with 18 minutes left but he was flagged offside.Despite Scotland’s best efforts in the closing stages they were unable to salvage a draw.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

Although the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top.

The prolific hitman said: “Winning the league was brilliant, but the way we won it was special. “Winning player of the year put the icing on the cake. “It’s the first senior title I have won – I won under-20 titles but nothing like this.  “I have never even been nominated before for a player award, so it’s quite surreal. “It’s probably the best weekend in my career, and I will never forget it.” But despite celebrating the title and looking forward to life in the Championship, United fans are nervously waiting to hear if Shankland will commit his future to Ian McCall’s side. He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"wren kitchens open new store","story":"NewsWren Kitchens to open new store at Ayr retail parkThe firm will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:38, 30 MAY 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new tenant is to take up residence in Ayr’s out-of-town shopping park.

The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

looked for any trees rubbish or other obstacles that may have fallen into the river, or been washed down stream, after the winter spates, which would block or obstruct the seatrout and salmon run.Salmon and seatrout need overhanging trees and shrubs for cover and can hide from their many predators, so it is important that the cutting of overhanging trees is done with the utmost care.Members only remove and trim anything that interferes with the fish having a stress free run up river or which blocks pools to the extent that the river could start to erode its banks.This has the bonus of making the pool more accessible for anglers to cast flies or spinners.The river clearing is not only for the anglers benefit all sizes of bushes and trees are washed down stream and can also be washed out to sea causing problems for trawlers which may catch them in their nets.Carradale angling club also have the fishing on Tangy loch which has a good stock of wild brown trout.The loch provides early season fishing for members and visitors, who are waiting for the right conditions to fish the river, and for anglers who only fish on still water.The trout season started on March 15 and the loch has been fishing well with members reporting some very good catches.In May every tide gives anglers an early chance to catch seatrout and the tidal water is always worth a go even when the river is at summer levels.To fish Carradale river or Tangy loch a permit is required.To join Carradale angling club or for a day permit contact the secretary David Shaw on 07909991388 or ask Kenny Craig in Longrow\u0026#8217s Hardware store.The club also have a joining day and potential new members are welcome to come to the Glen bar and restaurant in Carradale on Saturday June 2 at
