It’s time we started listening to them.\u0027   The length of the menstrual cycle varies between inidual women, but the average is every 28 days. However, cycles as short as 21 days or as long as 40 are not considered unusual.   The NHS advises women to contact their GP if their periods are irregular in certain situations. These include: if their periods suddenly become irregular and they are under 45-years-of-age, their periods come more often than every 21 days and less often than every 35 days, their period lasts longer than seven days, and there is a difference of at least 20 days between the shortest and longest menstrual cycle. Irregular periods can also lead to problems when women are trying to get pregnant as it becomes difficult to accurately track ovulation, the time when they are most likely to conceive. The latest UK Government data indicates just over 48million people have received two doses of Covid vaccines. "},{"url":null,"title":"Civil service unions call names REDACTED Sue Grays Partygate report","story":"Share this articleCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servants"},{"url":null,"title":"The END mandatory masks England","story":"Share this articleThe legal requirement will be replaced with guidance that urges people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Furthermore, free Covid lateral flow tests look set to be scrapped by July. People will instead be pointed towards an online ordering system to purchase the tests, which cost £30 for a pack of seven. The Department of Health said the changes come after a review of data last week including infections, vaccine efficacy, Covid pressures on the NHS, workforce absences, public behaviours, and views from the scientific community. Sajid Javid claimed the success of Britain’s vaccine rollout is ‘allowing us to cautiously return to plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country’.The Health Secretary insisted: ‘Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country. ‘As we learn to live with Covid, we need to be clear eyed that this virus is not going away so if you haven\u0027t already – please come forward for your first, second or booster jab.’ It comes as the Prime Minister awaits Miss Gray’s official report into multiple alleged parties in No10 and Whitehall during the pandemic.It is not clear what the report has discovered but an indication of how damaging it could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out, based in part on evidence obtained by the Gray investigation. There was speculation that after the report was not delivered yesterday, MPs and the public may have to wait until after the weekend for its publication, as Mr Johnson had promised to address the Commons shortly after it was released.There were suggestions that due to today being Holocaust Memorial Day and many MPs being back in their constituencies from Thursday afternoon, No10 may hold off on publishing the report once it was received.However, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the conclusions would be important enough to bring to the House straight away.Earlier, during Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign. Asked if he would quit, the Prime Minister said: ‘No.’Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson would not have to step aside even if he was interviewed by police in their probe.Speaking on Channel 4 News, Mr Rees-Mogg said ‘that wouldn\u0027t be a resigning matter, because people are innocent in this country until proved guilty’.But if the outcome of the Gray report is significantly damaging, Mr Johnson could face a revolt from his own MPs, who may choose to call a vote of no confidence.The Mail reported that Tories were urging the PM to scrap a planned hike in national insurance to win back their support.The Commons Treasury Committee has warned in a report released on Thursday that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would contribute to a rise in inflation.Conservative MP for Bolton North East Mark Logan said that while Mr Johnson had his support, there needed to be a reset.When the Gray report is published, sources close to the investigation team expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide.Downing Street said it is the ‘intention’ to publish the report in the format in which Mr Johnson receives it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ac2ca93636d34e78db86f43383839ea61bb361/0_162_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4e28dcc3a5b2fc3eaf944c43b43b8150","title":"single parent strength a photo essay","story":"An exhibition of his work opens in London’s Kings Cross from the end of January and will run until the beginning of April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee63b23849bd9af4319339a74a28163b143e9b3a/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=753ff1ac10203d209f421fcd778bca9a","title":"what are the hidden costs of our obsession with fish oil supplements podcast","story":"Madeleine Finlay speaks to environment journalist Richa Syal about why so many fish oil pills are rancid, and hears from journalist Dan Collyns in Chimbote, Peru, about how the industry is affecting the local environment and its residents"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3127cb88d2c1b2ec4da00d370774d84e6d351e/0_149_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=60e062fa9e0960a9cb99c765cfb144db","title":"australian open semi finals barty keys collins swiatek live","story":"Swiatek has to fight back here, and fast. And Collins is not quite so dominant, but her power wins a baseline rally to reach 40-15. A skidding serve gets the job done. Danger signs for Swiatek, whose second serve is swatted aside by Collins for 0-30. Then, a backhand bludgeon takes two break points for a double break. The first is saved by Swiatek’s guile, the second is missed, and Collins has full command of the set. Powerful serving from Collins, and a crashing backhand winner takes her to 40-0. She’s set off at quite a rate. Swiatek shows off her own power with a winner on 40-15, but a double-handed backhand winner takes the game. The American has started like an Amtrak. Collins starts with some real power off her service return, swiftly going 30-0 up, then a double fault presents two break points. And that’s claimed at the second opportunity. An early break, well claimed.  Gutsy hold from Keys when all seems lost. The first point sees Barty clatter a winner, the second sees more of the same. 0-30, but an oddly bouncing ball keeps her guessing for 15-30. Then Keys pulls off a mighty winner, right down the line. And another! And then Barty misses to hand over the hold. The thunder has started in Victoria, too.  Almost there. Having opened the door with a break, Barty slams it shut on Keys, who takes a deep breath. One of resignation as Barty, with a love hold, is one game away from the final. The break is on. Barty can see victory. Keys need to take advantage of Barty’s wobbles but goes long on a winner that was very achievable. Then does the same on a basic mid-rally baseline shot. That hands over two break points. The first is saved, then comes a missed first serve. Barty misses to go back to deuce. But follows up by an oblique backhand that sets Keys chasing down the court, break point again and one seized with some powerful hitting. Some wobbles from Barty? A very winnable smash is missed to gasps from the home crowd, the tension getting to everyone. Sighs of relief as she gets to 30-15 up. The first break point is offered up to Keys but closed off with a far better smash. Then Keys regrets a missed forehand, and Barty bludgeons her way to a hold that was far from easy. Keys is playing better. This game is held after a deuce or two and there are signs Barty is not quite at the levels of before. A crashing winner takes the game for a good hold.  The door remains closed on the Barty serve, and it’s 40-0 after an ace. The game is claimed to love with net-cord shot that puts Keys to the back of the court. Keys looks to really struggling here but produces a gritty hold. Barty’s game is just too strong and there are signs of despondency setting in. Still, she manages to send her opponent in the wrong direction to win a point, and then another for 30-30. And then a backhand from the back of the court forces a Barty error. Better from Keys. Much better. Back on court, and the dominance continues, with a game served out with ease. Keys seems to have expended all her energy on that previous game. A double fault hands over two break and set points. That’s taken with aplomb from Barty with a clubbing winner.  A very long service game to hold. The surge is on, and Barty takes it to 30-0 with just three shots played. A glimmer at 30-15 and then Barty overdoes one down the line . 30-30 feels like a small victory for Keys, but she messes up the chance for a winner on her return. But Barty tightens up, too, and overdoes it once more for deuce. Then a skidding ball hands over a break point, as Barty clatters the ball high and out. A speeding ace saves that, and then some athleticism forces Keys into an error. Still, we go back to deuce again as Keys finds her way into the match. It’s saved by two good serves but we have a match on her hands. The double break is claimed. Keys gets all keyed up, sorry, and whacks a gettable winner into the net cord for 30-30. Then a backhand return sets up another break point, one claimed with ease by Barty. In the blink of an eye, Barty serves to love. Keys has a real job on her hands to tame that service game.  Better from Keys, far better. Keys wins a point for 15-15 and looks relieved, following up with going 30-15 up with a powerful top-spun volley. Then comes a winner to the right of the court. Then a fine serve. Barty clatters an early ace, and Keys then fails to convert a second second for 30-0. Keys misses the next one to, and Barty already has command of the first set. The second serve crashes home. This match will be followed by the second semi, where Danielle Collins takes on Iga Swiątek. The business end of the tournament is here, and the weather is thundery in Melbourne. It’s likely the tennis will be much the same.

Photograph: The A decision to run a hybrid Leaving Cert this year could require the use of controversial “school profiling” to ensure there is consistency in teachers’ estimated marks, the Government has been told.Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other party leaders were informed by senior officials that an accredited grades model – based on teachers’ estimates – may need to draw on schools’ historical results in the Junior Cert exams.This is due to the absence of Junior Cert exam data for about 25 per cent of this year’s Leaving Cert candidates who never sat the exam in 2020 when it was cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.This data is regarded as crucial in the standardisation process, which aims to ensure teachers’ estimated grades in different schools are equitably awarded.The Government had planned to use schools’ historical performance in 2020 when Leaving Cert exams were replaced by a system based on teachers’ estimates. However, it dropped the plan following opposition claims that it could penalise students attending school in disadvantaged areas.A decision on the format of this year’s Leaving Cert, meanwhile, is likely within the next week. Students are calling for the introduction of a hybrid Leaving Cert on the basis that many have experienced significant disruption to their studies due to the pandemic.Potential optionsTeachers’ unions, however, are opposed to grading their students for the purposes of the Leaving Cert and say further adjustments to the exams are needed.It is understood Mr Martin, along with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, were briefed on potential options for the format of this year’s exam on Monday by officials including the Department of Education’s chief inspector Harold Hislop, secretary general Seán Ó Foghlú and Minister Norma Foley. A spokesman for the Taoiseach confirmed that a lack of data and issues around grade inflation were discussed at the meeting. He said everyone had sympathy for students and that changes were being factored into the exams, such as greater choice in questions and flexibility over practical work. A solution needed to take into account what was best for students as well as the wider system, he said, adding that nothing had been ruled out and that Ms Foley continued to engage with education stakeholders.The decision to omit school profiling in the 2020 Leaving Cert was at the centre of an legal challenge taken by Belvedere College student Freddie Sherry, who argued that the decision impacted unfairly on his results.However, the High Court ruled that the Government was fully entitled to make changes to the standardisation model which they considered to be in the public interest. It found that Mr Sherry had not shown he, or Belvedere, were subject of an unfairness arising from the final approach taken and had “certainly not” established an unfairness that would lead the court to conclude the system was unlawful.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"an post launches new stamps to celebrate centenary of ulysses","story":"Dublin-based milliner John Shevlin as James Joyce, displaying one of two new stamps created by An Post to celebrate the centenary of the publication of Ulysses. An Post has launched two new stamps to celebrate the centenary of the publication of James Joyce’s celebrated novel Ulysses.The Ulysses 100 stamps from An Post were designed by Amsterdam-based Irish designers, the Stone Twins. Ulysses was initially published as a series of stories in an American journal and was first published as a complete novel on February 2nd, 1922 – James Joyce’s 40th birthday. The book chronicles a single day, June 16th, 1904, now celebrated as Bloomsday, in the lives of Stephen Dedalus along with husband-and-wife Leopold and Molly Bloom as they meander through the streets and suburbs of Dublin. The stamps are inspired by Joyce’s use of the ‘Gilbert Schema’, two elaborate tables he produced to help friends understand his novel.The two-stamp design consists of a total of 18 sections, which signify the number of chapters in the book. The stamp design also features photographs by JJ Clarke, a doctor from Castleblayney in Co Monaghan who took vivid images of daily life in Dublin when he was a medical student in the city between 1897 and 1904. The inverted type used in the stamp design was chosen to reflect Joyce’s experimental use of language.An Post expects “strong interest in the Ulysses 100 stamps at home and abroad from collectors, the Joycean community, and those with an interest in literature.”A specially designed souvenir envelope features a JJ Clarke photograph of 14-18 Ormond Quay Lower and Swifts Row, taken from the South Quays and featuring the River Liffey. It also features both of the Ulysses 100 stamps and a special cancellation mark.Chief executive of An Post, David McRedmond, said Ulysses’ 100th anniversary “shows that Ulysses is as relevant now as a work of art as when it was written. These stamps reflect the unique mix of modernism and classicism that define the novel.”“Frozen in time the images on these stamps illustrate remarkably the period of James Joyce’s Ulysses in 1904. It is tempting to think that in the world of fiction these stamps might have adorned Bloom’s letter to Martha Clifford, ” Senator David Norris said.The Ulysses 100 stamps and a special First Day Cover commemorative envelope are available at selected post offices nationwide and online at anpostshopStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"planning for eight major road schemes stalls over funds shortage","story":"“Funding available within the first half of the National Development Plan is not sufficient to progress all the schemes as outlined in the NDP through the planning and design phase.”Planning works on eight major road schemes have been suspended by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) due to a shortage of funds. The projects include a section of the strategically significant N11M11 corridor between Dublin and Rosslare Harbour, Co Wexford, and part of a regionally important transport corridor between Limerick and Waterford.TII chief executive Peter Walsh said in November that the National Development Plan’s (NDP) budget for roads – some €1.1 billion for the period 2021-2025 – would provide “limited scope” to advance schemes.An analysis showed more than €800 million of the total had already been committed to schemes in the late planning or development stage, leaving other less-advanced plans without the necessary funds to progress. Additional €4bn The authority confirmed that works on eight major schemes have been postponed. They are: N2 Clontibret to the Border N4 Mullingar to Longford N11M11 Junction 4 to Junction 14 N24 Waterford to Cahir N25 Carraigtwohill to Middleton N25 Waterford to Glenmore N52 Tullamore to Kilbeggan and N59 Clifden to Maam Cross. TII is due to receive an additional €4 billion during the second half of the NDP between 2026 and 2030 but, given changes in Government assessment priorities, many of these schemes are effectively in doubt. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan last month announced a National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland (Nifti). He said this reflected “the need to rapidly decarbonise” to meet national carbon emissions reduction targets by considering public transport and active travel (cycling and walking) options before roads. Suspended projectsHe said the four Nifti priorities for future land transport investment would be decarbonisation protection and renewal mobility of people and goods in urban areas and enhanced regional and rural connectivity. It is understood the priorities would be applied to the suspended projects post-2025, potentially resulting in measures to reduce private car use and promote public transport journeys and active travel rather than road building. TII said it “delivers on Government policy relating to national roads as set out in the NDP, National Planning Framework, Nifti and the Climate Action Plan”. It added: “Funding available within the first half of the NDP is not sufficient to progress all the schemes as outlined in the NDP through the planning and design phase. As a result, the progression of projects must be phased in line with available funding.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord taoiseach s patience snaps as mary lou plays the elitism card","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald he had a “far different” upbringing to her during testy exchanges in the Dáil.  Video: Oireachtas TV .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: Playing the man not the ball? Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireDing-Dong! Mary Lou on high (horse).Maybe a bit late for a Christmas carol, but old scores were all the rage in the Dáil on Wednesday, where rage was also all the rage.But before we get to that, how about some good news?For in the midst of vicious exchanges on the housing crisis between the Taoiseach and the leader of Sinn Féin, there came confirmation from a gilded bunker in Baggot Street which gladdened hearts all across the land.Robert Watt, the Generous Salary, sorry, general secretary of the Department of Health, is now happily restored to optimum pay (nearly €295,000).This emerged in a one-line statement from his department: “The secretary general has confirmed that he is in receipt of the full salary for his role.”Having previously waived the €81,000 pay rise he was due upon moving from the Department of Public Expenditure to his current berth, the civil servant recently refused to tell the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee if this was still the case. Pointed remarks about transparency from two senior Government Ministers this week may have forced a change of heart.Because after a couple of gentle whacks from Darragh O’Brien and Heather Humphreys, The Generous Salary revealed he is now accepting his full whack.Word came through around midday, after a Labour Party motion on spiralling inflation and the soaring cost of living had given way to a rancorous clash on affordable rents.It lifted the spirits of our post-pandemic inflation nation.Shouting matchThe news sustained us through the bitter row over housing during Leaders’ Questions and helped us recover from an angry shouting match between Michael Healy-Rae and the Labour Party which took place just before.There is always an edge to the exchanges between Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, with the Taoiseach constantly annoyed by the Sinn Féin leader’s attempts to box him off as a supporter and enabler of billionaire property developers while he tries to explain what his Government is doing to tackle the crisis he repeatedly calls “the single most important issue facing our country at this moment in time”.Mary Lou has the justifiable anger and frustration of shut-out buyers and stressed-out renters on her side. She has an arsenal of harrowing anecdotes to draw upon. She has Eoin Ó Broin to throw his book at him. She has the entire dysfunctional mess of the property market for ammunition.Go fix it, she tells the Taoiseach. Fix it now. Do something. Do something now.He outlines the projects and schemes under way. He talks about the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State. Record “commencements”. Billions being spent. Construction bouncing back. “The momentum, as it were, is in the pipeline.”But it needs time and “a whole-of-government approach” and cross-party buy-in.Mary Lou McDonald gets to her feet.“So, you failed,” she tells him. “Let me help you, Taoiseach, to try and absorb the reality.” She holds up a photocopied page showing an advert for a flat to rent. Mad money. “So, this is a storage room . . .” she begins, before producing two more pages of equally dismal places for rent.Converted hallwayOne in Cork where “you could touch your fridge if you stretch your feet out of your bed” and a converted hallway in Dublin going for €910 a month.“That’s probably a snip, in your mind.”But she wasn’t finished with him yet.She had shown him the reality for Generation Rent. “Don’t you dare talk to me about false narratives or claim that you understand the crisis. You clearly don’t. While you’re there scratching your head I’ve told you two things you can do that will work . . .”If he does them, people might believe “that you finally get it”.Sinn Féin TDs cheered their leader as she resumed her seat.The Taoiseach rose, clearly annoyed by the personal nature of the attack. So he took the personal route too, stung by her parting shot that he doesn’t “get it”.“You paint a narrative in terms of me” – he pointed to himself – “as being orced from reality and all of that.”Across the floor the TDs couldn’t resist. “You are! You are!” they chorused.He put up a hand to silence them. “Okay. I just want to say to you, deputy, my background and where I grew up and what we had to put up with is far different to yours.”The Taoiseach was leaning forward, directly addressing his opposite number. He didn’t raise his voice but his anger was evident in those clipped, level tones.A few dissenting voices rose up. Again, his hand went up to quell them. He wanted to make his point, which he did, eyes still locked on his political rival.“Don’t you dare lecture me,” he said slowly. “Okay?”Bus driverThere was a sense of an old score being settled here by a man frustrated and totally fed up by the constant inferences that he is a heartless member of some detached, moneyed elite. Micheál Martin, the son of a bus driver from Cork city, who believes he incorporates the decent values of old Fianna Fáil, had had enough.“I understand the realities of life as well as anybody in this House. And I don’t pretend to understand it more,” he said as the heckling grew in intensity and the back-and-forth became more and more bitter, Eoin Ó Broin and Pearse Doherty joining Mary Lou in the fray.Still angry, the Taoiseach accused Sinn Féin of talking from both sides of its mouth and exploiting the crisis for political gain.“This crisis is too big for politics,” he said.Mary Lou McDonald shot over a pitiful eye, batting his words away with a dismissive hand as if speaking to a difficult child.“Stop that. Stop that. Stop that,” she repeated. “Stop now.”“Deputy, you are not the leader. You were not appointed by the Politburo,” snarled Micheál.“So just BACK OFF!”The Taoiseach’s unusual reaction was understandable – there is a definite element of playing the man and not the ball to Mary Lou’s approach, but when the Ceann Comhairle called time, one suspects Sinn Féin will have been far more satisfied with their afternoon’s work.Earlier in the day, it was Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae who took the chance to settle an old score. Last year, after lambasting the Labour Party for its lack of affinity with the plain people of Ireland, the Kerry businessman was badly roughed up by the party’s new deputy for Fingal, Duncan Smith.“I’m not going to be lectured on understanding workers. I do not have to put on a political costume and a caricature to pretend I am working class, like some,” Smith told the Healy-Rae brothers during his excoriating contribution.Cost of livingSo, when Labour brought forward a motion on the rising cost of living, Michael saw his chance to get one back for the team.“The people who are moving the motion are the people who wanted to put a water tax on everybody in this country and said they’d turn off the water if they did not pay the tax.

Such an outcome would be calamitous, and result in a vicious class and cultural war from which the country would never recover.There are now just two viable options if the party is to bounce back. The first is for Boris Johnson to remain in office, attempt to fix the immediate damage caused by Partygate, and then recant his worst policies and delegate huge amounts of power to a David Frost-like CEO in No 10. We would need the old Boris back: he would have to ditch the National Insurance increase, embrace a freeze on public spending and accept major shifts to his green agenda. There would need to be a clear-out of the Cabinet as well as advisers, with all the neo-socialists, green fanatics and pro-woke crowd exiting immediately.Every policy would need to be judged on whether it makes Brexit Britain more competitive, andor by how it improves the lives, and addresses the fears, of culturally conservative and aspirational Britain. The aim would be to ruthlessly target the 43.6 per cent of the electorate who voted Tory in 2019, but by following the broadly conservative approach these voters expected, rather than the weird blend of reheated neo-Brownite social democracy and green paternalism that was unleashed upon them instead.Crucially, the about-turn I’m describing is not about lobbing a few shreds of “red meat” to a starving base, penning random “Right-wing” tweets announcing a policy that unravels within hours, or even replacing a few figures in No 10 or Whitehall. No, only a total reset will do.The second option, regrettably, would be for Johnson to step down and be replaced by somebody who follows an improved version of the 2019 strategy. This inidual would need to grip a machinery of state recaptured by the Blob – and even more so now civil servants have been tasked with potentially terminating the careers of elected politicians. He or she would then need to impose, at great speed, an agenda that fuses pro-capitalist reforms while appealing to suburban cultural conservatives with a tough agenda on crime, human rights, wokery, Brexit and much else besides.Reverting to a Cameron-Osborne, Southern hoodie-and-husky-hugging approach would be calamitous, delivering even less than it did in 2010 or 2015: the metropolitan elites have shifted to the Left because of Brexit, the woke revolution and other factors, and in any case, Cameron was only successful when he briefly tacked “Right-wards”, taking on the SNP and promising a referendum.All other options for the Tories are a guaranteed disaster. Indeed, a failure to seize the moment risks jeopardising the PM’s two historic achievements: Brexit, and the political realignment which returned the Tories to levels of support last seen in the 1980s, giving them a mandate to reverse the UK’s decline.On Brexit, the job is a quarter done. We’ve left that dreadful, amoral technocratic entity de jure, although Northern Ireland remains unresolved. But de facto the only significant changes have involved immigration and foreign policy. Yet the former is being ruined by a shocking inability to control illegal arrivals from France, and the latter, a hugely significant and laudable gain delivered by Liz Truss, doesn’t affect normal people’s lives sufficiently.Yes, Truss has signed trade deals, but – through no fault of her own – she has been prevented from being as liberal as she could have been. All the other tweaks to the acquis communautaire post-Brexit could have been delivered by Labour. It would be extremely easy to rejoin the single market tomorrow given how little true ergence has taken place.Brexit can only deliver its potential if it is accompanied by a series of radical reforms. Yet for all of Johnson’s boosterism, the structure of the state remains unchanged the antiquated nature of the civil service untackled the tax system has become ever less pro-enterprise and pro-growth Britain is a worse place to do business than it was five or 10 or 20 years ago there is more regulation, rather than less freeports have been adulterated beyond recognition the planning system is a joke the universities are a mess and the schools in decline and the NHS is imploding as a result of systemic institutional failure, absurd gigantism and lethally misplaced incentives.This is madness. We need revolutionary shifts in a range of areas, from the precautionary principle to tax to reporting rules to the regulation of financial services: in each case, the UK needs to be the best place in Europe (and hopefully, the world) to hire, set up or expand a business, erect a new factory or recruit scientists. Unless all of this happens, the establishment drumbeat that Brexit has been a failure will grow ever louder, there will be hundreds of academic papers seeking to “prove” this “lack of success”, and by the late 2020s a Labour government will feel sufficiently emboldened to sign back up to myriad European initiatives. The Tories must erge so much that this becomes impossible.The Great Realignment is the other one of Johnson’s achievements that must be salvaged from the ruins of Partygate: the creation of a new coalition for the 2020s and beyond, consisting of Brexiteers, Thatcherites, blue collar workers, suburbanites, the aspirational lower middle classes (including a growing number of ethnic minorities) and wealthier Southern shire-dwellers. That coalition, at its widest, is stronger than the urbanwokeScottish nationalist alliance that Labour can deliver. The 2019 election saw people – especially in the North – who should previously have been Tories because of their lifestyle, interests and beliefs finally make the jump. This coalition is now in crisis, and must urgently be rebuilt.It can sometimes make sense to play for time in the hope that something turns up. This nightmare is different. The Conservative Party must urgently stop this catastrophic drift, or face the prospect of complete ruination.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 report into Boris Johnson being held up by legal checksNeil Young\u0026#39s music to be removed from Spotify after he issues Joe Rogan ultimatumUkraine latest news: Russia\u0026#39s top diplomat criticises US response to security concerns Joe Biden promised a Black woman on the Supreme Court \u0026#39in exchange\u0026#39 for crucial endorsement in 2020 election\u0026#39Spooky\u0026#39 spinning object detected deep within the Milky WayFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shakespeare del boy gave us phrases live longest","story":"When did you last say “Pip, pip”? Some opinion-survey company has been going round asking people if they use phrases like pip, pip or dog’s dinner. Since more than half the people asked didn’t use them, the survey folk concluded that “phrases that were once commonplace in Britain are seldom used nowadays”.When was pip, pip ever commonplace? It was first used in the 1890s to imitate a car horn, but we’re all familiar with it from P G Wodehouse – Pip, pip! Toodle-oo! Tinkerty-tonk! These were seldom off the lips of Gussie Fink-Nottle, and as long as Wodehouse is read, they will remain familiar to us. We’re not going to start using them seriously, only jocularly or with invisible inverted commas.“The survey’s a bit of a dog’s dinner, scientifically,” says Dot Wordsworth, the Spectator’s longstanding language expert. “Even the phrase that 78 per cent said they don’t use – pearls before swine – would be recognised by most. Otherwise, the old joke (sometimes attributed, like many others, to Dorothy Parker), ‘artificial pearls before real swine’ would fall flat. But it’s as popular as ever.”So it seems wrong to think that once upon a time we scattered our speech with noble phrases from the Bible and Shakespeare, but now can only summon up secondhand wit from TV ads, even if it’s true that some authors of letters to The  end them “Simples!”, for want of anything better to put before their signature.That’s bad, and I get quite annoyed to hear “Lovely jubbly”, as though it were bound in itself to bring joy, rather than being a mere catchphrase from Only Fools and Horses. It was first used there in 1989, as a tacit adaptation of “lubbly Jubbly”, a 1950s advertising slogan for an orange-flavoured drink in a triangular-pyramid packet. In my schooldays it was sometimes frozen and sucked free of its flavour through one chewed corner.Such phrases are annoying partly because they are associated with recent decades and have gone out of fashion, like words such as groovy or fab (though that has come back in, half-ironically). But an origin in Shakespeare is little guarantee of cultural superiority. Take be-all and end-all. Often it is used to express disapproval of someone who gives himself airs, thinking himself the be-all and end-all, as though he were the only pebble on the beach. Macbeth, though, used it in quite a different sense: that it would be fine if the murder he contemplated was the end of the affair.We deploy plenty of phrases from Shakespeare, unaware of their origins. The same goes with the Bible. The skin of your teeth is now used for “a very narrow margin”. It comes from the Book of Job in the very literal translation of the Authorised Version. What Job meant by “I am escaped with the skin of my teeth” is hotly disputed, but that does not affect its common meaning today.It’s trivially true that when people heard the Bible read out in church they often picked up phrases from it. Now we share advertising slogans in common: “Vorsprung durch Technik,” I heard Tim Harford say jocularly on Radio 4’s More or Less last week. How could anyone use it not jocularly?Yet borrowed phrases take on a life of their own – or become dead metaphors, better known as clichés. On the Today programme, someone said “across the piste”. I’d like to think that the phrase originated as “across the piece” (or “across the board”, as we used to say, with reference to a bookie’s blackboard of odds for a win or place). The broadcasting classes, however, are more familiar with the ski slopes than with a piece of work, and stick to the snowy linguistic high ground.Some phrases, though, slog through the centuries with surprising tenacity. A parent today may say encouragingly to a small child that it’s time to climb the wooden hill to Bedfordshire. It might be thought to go back to 1936 when Vera Lynn released a record by that name. But Bedfordshire features in Jonathan Swift’s dramatised collection of clichés known as Polite Conversation (1738). The fashionable characters round the card table grow sleepy and Colonel Atwit says: “I’m going to the Land of Nod.” (A place mentioned in the Bible, open to an obvious play on words.) Miss Notable replies: “Faith, I’m for Bedfordshire.”For those of a less savagely satirical mind than Swift, clichés can almost seem like poetry. After all, we hardly know why we like proverbs saying obvious things. “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good,” we say cheerfully, to no apparent purpose.A proverb has made it when it starts being quoted in part: “It’s an ill wind...” “When the cat’s away...” “The proof of the pudding...” In fact, once a proverb is ground down, speakers don’t always know how to finish it. Instead of “The proof of the pudding’s in the eating thereof” (a nice archaic bolt-on), they erroneously come out with: “The proof’s in the pudding”. That’s not the extinction of an endangered phrase, just part of the endlessly playful development of language.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 report into Boris Johnson being held up by legal checksNeil Young\u0026#39s music to be removed from Spotify after he issues Joe Rogan ultimatumUkraine latest news: Russia\u0026#39s top diplomat criticises US response to security concerns Joe Biden promised a Black woman on the Supreme Court \u0026#39in exchange\u0026#39 for crucial endorsement in 2020 election\u0026#39Spooky\u0026#39 spinning object detected deep within the Milky WayFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke push cancel fairy tales daylight magic","story":"Once Upon a Time there was a boy called Jack who traded in his cow for beans in order to demonstrate the merits of agri-entrepreneurship. But a wicked giant lived at the top of the beanstalk and all the exceedingly tall people were offended, so the story was banned.And Once Upon Another Time there was a sweet-natured girl whose stoical forbearance enabled her to triumph over a wicked stepmother and two ugly sisters, but her tale must never be told because all the blended families and body-shaming activists took umbrage.And now, Once Upon This Very Time, a live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has come under pre-emptive fire because, although it isn’t yet in production, it is already an affront to people of small stature and should be set alight with torches on the village green.The Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, has decried Disney for “hypocrisy” after it trumpeted its ersity by casting a Latina as Snow White, at the same time as telling a “backwards story of the seven dwarves living in a cave”.Generations of children may have been enthralled by the fable of Snow White – one of fortitude, friendship and the potentially fatal consequences of accepting unwashed fruit from strangers – but in our literal and hypersensitive age, the depiction of dwarves within this enchanted fantasyland is now an apparently justifiable cause of outrage.This is by no means the first time this favourite fairy tale has been castigated. In May of last year the newly revamped Disneyland ride, Snow White’s Enchanted Wish, fell foul of cancel culture because it mimicked the classic cartoon with an animatronic prince kissing his princess to rouse her from her poisoned slumber. Complaints about this supposed sexual assault went viral, as ill will so often does.We appear in these moments to forget the original intention of these stories. Snow White serves for the entertainment of little children who still believe a kiss makes things better. This one was a classic long before the early 19th century, when the Brothers Grimm set about collating these “crucial repositories of human understanding and culture”, as the fairy tale academic Marina Warner puts it, that were passed down in an oral tradition that predates mass literacy.To obsess over the identity politics of Snow White’s dwarves – or, say, the “sexism” of evil stepmothers and wicked witches – is to ignore the simple fact that fairy tale characters are all cartoonish caricatures whose real purpose is to serve as vessels for far deeper moral lessons.Fairy tales are full of life lessons and stern warnings about the fate awaiting those who break rules or transgress a community’s boundaries. Little Red Riding Hood’s troubles begin when she ignores her mother’s instruction to keep to the path. Beauty and the Beast is a moral primer on not judging people by their appearance – especially when they are excessively rich. We lose the importance of these lessons if we begin to tamper with the characters that deliver them.Viewing ancient myths through a modern lens should enhance our understanding of our forebears and societal mores. Redacting their folk tales of evil queens and gallant knights is worse than letting daylight in on magic it is to drive a fairy coach and horses through a fantastical world that still has the power to bewitch us today.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 report into Boris Johnson being held up by legal checksNeil Young\u0026#39s music to be removed from Spotify after he issues Joe Rogan ultimatumUkraine latest news: Russia\u0026#39s top diplomat criticises US response to security concerns Joe Biden promised a Black woman on the Supreme Court \u0026#39in exchange\u0026#39 for crucial endorsement in 2020 election\u0026#39Spooky\u0026#39 spinning object detected deep within the Milky WayFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chelsea flower show goes back roots rules put plants paving","story":"You might assume the clue was in the name - but the Chelsea Flower Show is setting a quota to make sure its gardens have enough flowers.A new category sets a minimum level of plant area for the first time in bid to refocus attention on greenery rather than the elaborate pavilions and water features that have come to characterise the show\u0027s competitive gardens.The All About Plants category, introduced this year, requires designers to use 75 per cent of the available space on living plants instead of hard landscaping such as paths or buildings.The four gardens are each raising awareness of a charity, with the good causes including mental health support for mothers, sustainable fashion and the benefits of nature for children.Lottie Delamain, whose garden for the charity Fashion Revolution focuses on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, said the plant-focused designs were more relatable for the show\u0027s visitors.Plants have got to be the star of the show in this category, which is a really fun challenge.On a practical level for visitors, it\u0027s quite nice to see a garden that is predominantly plants because it\u0027s a much more affordable way of gardening, it\u0027s a much more sustainable way of gardening. I hope it will be a bit more realistic for people to recreate at home, she said.Chelsea\u0027s major show gardens often feature elaborate water features, paving, pergolas and even buildings.She added that the hundreds of thousands of pounds of hard landscaping in Chelsea\u0027s usual gardens can kind of detract from the plants.I\u0027m not taking away from those gardens at all, they\u0027re absolutely amazing, and they are the pinnacle of garden excellence, but I think for this category what they were trying to do was go back to plants being the focus of gardens.The gardens will also be displayed inside the Great Pavilion marquee, the first time this has been done.To create a garden in the indoor setting, gardeners are building plants up on stages and introducing lighting to make sure the plants can be seen in dim evening light.The Great Pavilion is normally used to host displays of plants, with stands in previous years dedicated to roses, dahlias and fruit and vegetable produce, while show gardens are located outdoors.But organisers decided that the focus on unusual and specialist flowers meant the new category\u0027s gardens were better suited to accompany the indoor displays.These include Rubus lineatus, a bramble with white flowers and silver leaves, Aloe striatula, a type of aloe that can handle UK weather, and Isatis tinctoria, which produces the traditional blue dye woad.Polly Wilkinson, whose garden “This too shall pass” is designed around the mental health challenges of motherhood, said the new category reflected a growing interest in making gardens more nature-friendly.This is the first time where plants are the focus - well, they\u0027re always the focus, but it\u0027s playing to those rules of really limiting the hardscape and really focusing on giving that space over to plants.Any opportunity to promote how a garden doesn\u0027t have to be a lawn and pathways, and can actually be stuffed with very joyful plants, is a lovely opportunity to do that.Chelsea was held in the autumn last year due to Covid-19 but will return to its usual May date this spring.A spokeswoman for the RHS said the category had been introduced to support growers, particularly those of specialist or unusual plants.The designers have been encouraged to use interesting planting combinations and so the category is about showing off the many different plants out there and the ones you might not usually see at RHS Chelsea.In the gardens, these unusual plants have been used to highlight a good cause and so the gardens show the many positive powers of plants in all their forms.More from NewsWatch: Harrowing footage shows man kidnapping his girlfriend and bundling her into a vanUkraine latest news: Russia\u0026#39s top diplomat criticises US response to security concerns Sue Gray latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 report into Boris Johnson being held up by legal checksNeil Young\u0026#39s music to be removed from Spotify after he issues Joe Rogan ultimatumJoe Biden promised a Black woman on the Supreme Court \u0026#39in exchange\u0026#39 for crucial endorsement in 2020 election\u0026#39Spooky\u0026#39 spinning object detected deep within the Milky WayMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"6 questions everyone needs sue","story":" questions everyone needs Sue Grays report to answer - but it might not answerTop civil servant Sue Gray plans to send a full report to No on lockdown-busting gatherings imminently - after deciding it would not prejudice a police probeSue Gray is a top civil servant Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan It was another day of chaos at Downing St as Boris Johnsonaposs government continued the wait for Sue Grayaposs report into the Downing Street lockdown-busting gatherings. Ms Gray, a top civil servant, is due to set out the facts around a string of gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall in  . The Mirror understands Ms Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. These facts could be enough by themselves for reasonable people to decide the PM either followed - or broke - lockdown rules. But Ms Gray might not actually say in black and white that the Prime Minister broke the rules. That’s because her terms of reference state “any matters relating to the conduct of Ministers” will have to “follow the process set out in the Ministerial Code.” The Ministerial Code adds: “It is not the role of the Cabinet Secretary or other officials to enforce the Code.” Instead that is for Lord Geidt, the Independent Advisor on Ministerial Interests, who can only start an investigation with Boris Johnson’s permission… and who can have his findings overruled by Boris Johnson.  Did Boris Johnson break the law  At the time of many of the gatherings, it was illegal to gather indoors for social reasons with people not in your household. A key defence will be whether the PM and officials believed birthday and Friday night gatherings were “reasonably necessary for work” - an exemption under the law. Ms Gray’s report could shed light on this. If the facts she sets out indicate to most reasonable people that the Prime Minister might have broken the law, it will add huge pressure on him to resign. But she will not say in concrete terms whether or not Mr Johnson broke the law - that is a job for police, not civil servants. Police are now investigating a “number of” gatherings, and it will be up to them whether to issue fixed penalty notices against the PM or staff. But they could take months to report.  Was Boris Johnson warned about the May  ‘BYOB’ party or not  One of the key contested claims is about the ‘bring your own booze’ party in the Downing Street garden on  May , when outdoor gatherings were banned. Mr Johnson has admitted attending for  minutes but claimed he thought it was a work event. Crucially, he has denied being warned in advance that the event could break the rules. This is disputed by ex-aide Dominic Cummings. He backed up claims by a former No staffer who, according to the Sunday Times, believed “at least two people” told the Prime Minister it was “a party” and should be immediately cancelled. Mr Cummings said a senior staffer replied to an e-mail invite from top aide Martin Reynolds, voicing concerns, and that Mr Reynolds promised to raise that with the PM. Will Ms Gray’s report blow this defence apart  We don’t know. It’s a crucial question.  Are there photos of Boris Johnson with wine  According to Sky News, Ms Gray has been handed photos of Boris Johnson with bottles of wine at one gathering. But earlier this week, it was thought she was unlikely to include any such photos in her report - which was more likely to be presented in text form. She could, perhaps, allude to any such photos in the text of a report. But not publishing them would leave questions about exactly what evidence she received. It would also risk any such photos leaking out in a steady “drip drip” of revelations after the report was meant to put the issue to bed. Dominic Cummings - who Ms Gray questioned - has also claimed there are more photos yet to come out. Are there more incriminating text messages and e-mails  A bomb was lit under the Partygate scandal when ITV News published an e-mail from Martin Reynolds to more than  staff inviting them for a drink. The Mirror also revealed that No staff had “wine time Fridays” programmed into their electronic calendars. But other than that, many of the revelations have been based on sources and eyewitness accounts rather than documents. If Ms Gray reveals more incriminating emails or texts - especially any that involve Boris Johnson - it could be a fatal blow for some people’s careers. But it’s thought she is unlikely to write sweeping annexes of full streams of messages, or to name the staff who require disciplinary action. So there are questions over how far the report will get to the bottom of this in the eyes of the public. Were there gatherings in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s private flat  On multiple occasions since early December, claims have emerged of gatherings being held against lockdown rules in the private flat Boris and Carrie Johnson share above  Downing Street. Each time these have emerged, they have been denied as categorically untrue by the Downing Street and Mrs Johnson’s press operations. We don’t knowMs Gray has been told the same claims that were made to the press, including the Mirror. Butshe has - andshe were to make a ruling on whether the claims were true - that could be explosive for the PM and his we.

Instead they were given bleak advice for each worker to bring “your own personal mini-buffet” during the third lockdown in Spring . The guidance still appeared to be in force in November  - even after most legal restrictions were lted. Downing Street has tried to defend a cake-sharing gathering for the PM’s birthday on  June  by saying it was a “brief moment” between meetings.  Staff, the PM’s interior designer and his we Carrie gathered in the Cabinet Room in  Downing Street during the first lockdown, while indoor socialising was still illegal. Now Covid guidance for Department for Work and Pensions staff, leaked to the Mirror, appears to show the gulf between the Prime Minister’s behaviour and that expected from junior workers. The document, issued during the pandemic, described arrangements for “religious festivals, birthdays and retirements etc”.  It said “buffets and food sharing etc” were “not possible” due to “restrictions around hygiene and keeping your distance from other people”. It added: “There are alternatives you can consider such as bringing your own personal mini-buffet, finding a suitable socially distanced area where you can eat your own food together but stay safely apart, whilst ensuring suitable hand hygiene.” The guidance even told workers to “avoid passing cards physically to colleagues” and consider making a charity donation instead. And it said: “Any get-togethers for meals   drinks etc. outside the office should meet current Government and Devolved Administration guidelines.” The Jobcentre worker told the Mirror: “We in the lower levels of civil service specically weren’t allowed to arrange events based on sharing food. “So it wasn’t just  minutes and a bit of cake for Boris Johnson - it was a kick in the teeth. It’s relatively small in comparison to people who have lost loved ones. “But for civil servants at the very bottom to be following strict guidance while doing a gruelling job, as those at the top laughed and ate cake and drank wine together to let off steam, feels really unfair to me.” A senior DWP manager e-mailed the guidance to staff to remind them ahead of Christmas in November , four months after England’s ‘Freedom Day’. He wrote: “The use of DWP premises for holding any sort of s apart from normal business was curtailed some years ago due to an incident at a party.“At this time and given the current Coronavirus guidance, the holding of social s on a DWP site is not permitted.”The guidance added: “The best present is to know we have kept each othersafe from coronavirus.” The DWP was approached for comment on the leaked guidance.

The top civil servant plans to send a full report to No on lockdown-busting gatherings imminently - after deciding it would not prejudice a police probe. Downing Street is expected to publish that report within hours of receiving it and the Tory leader will then rush to Parliament to make a statement. But Downing Street had still not received Sue Gray’s report as of .pm tonight. And the Commons adjourned for today at .pm - meaning Mr Johnson cannot make a statement until .am on Thursday at the earliest.  That suggests No will not publish Sue Gray’s report tonight, eventhey receive it in time, because Mr Johnson would have little chance to own the narrative in Parliament. It follows days of chaotic briefing and counter-briefing over the report after Sue Gray concluded her work into around a dozen parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. It was thought the report would have to be delayed or split in two after Scotland Yard announced it would investigate “a number of” gatherings inside No. But it then emerged Ms Gray would send her full findings to No after all.  While there were concerns it could prejudice the police investigation, lockdown offences are punished with fines so any Scotland Yard probe is unlikely to end up in court. Boris Johnson ’s spokesman indicated the delay was due to checking with police, saying: “We need assurance that nothing we’ve received cuts across the Met”. No insisted its “intention” was to publish the Sue Gray report in the same format Boris Johnson receives it. The Mirror understands Sue Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. Instead it is likely to be a detailed summary, and could recommend disciplinary action against inidual staff but this would be kept secret. Boris Johnson could be interviewed by police over the parties - the first time a sitting PM has been grilled by cops in  years. The PM’s spokesman said he was not aware of the police asking to interview the Prime Minister in relation to the Met inquiry, but as a rule Iaposm not going to be getting into iniduals who may or may not be involved. Labour could use parliamentary procedures in an attempt to force the publication of the full Gray reportMr Johnson does not release it.That could take the form of a humble address, effectively a message to the Queen demanding the publication of papers. The Prime Minister has been speaking to Tory MPs in the Commons in an attempt to shore up his position while he waits for the report. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions earlier, Mr Johnson rejected calls to resign and insisted he was getting on with the job, although he acknowledged there were people who want me out of the way. The contents of Ms Grayaposs report could play a signicant role in deciding the fate of Mr Johnsonaposs leadership. Tory critics are waiting for its findings before decidingthey will submit formal letters of no confidence in him or not.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign.Askedhe would now quit, the Prime Minister said: No. Sir Keir said: We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit. He said Mr Johnson and his Government had shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country. Mr Johnson replied: Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I donapost deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way. But he said Sir Keir wanted him out because he knows that this Government can be trusted to deliver. He added: Weaposre - and in particular I am - getting on with the job.  The issue of what form the Gray report will be published in appears to be a source of tension between the inquiry team and No . Sources close to the probe expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide. The steady stream of alleged breaches of lockdown rules have undermined the Prime Minister, but many critics have held off putting in formal letters of no confidence until Ms Grayaposs report is released. If Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, receives  letters - from % of Tory MPs - a vote on Mr Johnsonaposs leadership would be held. Robert Halfon, Tory chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said Mr Johnson needs to reset his administration. I donapost need Sue Gray or the police to tell me or my constituents of Harlow that whataposs gone on has been pretty awful, he told Times Radio. We all feel let down and disappointed.

The inquiry chief wants the report to be published in full so needs their sign off before sending it to the Prime Minister. It means Mr Johnson’s leadership is still hanging in the balance - with No  anxiously awaiting the contents of the final draft. It could even be delayed until next week, raising the prospect of already mutinous Tory MPs encouraged to take action by angry constituents this weekend.The PM also faces being interviewed by police after Scotland Yard said Downing Street parties crossed the threshold for investigation. But the Mirror can also reveal that Mr Johnson’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, downplayed down the severity of the police probe in a meeting of Government advisors on Tuesday night.  “At worst it will be like getting a fixed penalty fine for speeding, nothing to worry about,” he told them.During a rowdy PMQs, Mr Johnson rejected calls to quit as he waited anxiously for the official report into the ‘partygate’ row.The PM insisted he was “getting on with the job”, although he acknowledged there were people who “want me out of the way” for a iety of reasons.  He and his allies have been speaking to dozens of Tory MPs in his Commons office over the last  hours in an attempt to shore up his position. Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the PM of showing “nothing but contempt” for the public over lockdown parties.The ex-Director of Public Prosecutions blasted: “If he misled Parliament, he must resign.” But pressed on whether he would now quit, Mr Johnson said: “No.” Mr Starmer said: “We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit.”  The Government had “shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country”, he added. Mr Johnson replied: “Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I don’t deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way.” An indication of how damaging the Gray report could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out. Downing Street has previously said the report will be published in full - and sources close to the Gray inquiry said that was their expectation.  But ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide - and No  would only say it was its “intention” to publish the whole report. However, any attempt to hold back parts of it would be met by a barrage of criticism.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, tipped as a leading candidate to succeed Mr Johnson, said: “He’s admitted that mistakes were made and I % support him, and want him to continue as Prime Minister.”She claimed there could be “security issues” which mean parts of the Gray report are “problematic to publish”. But she stressed: “We have been absolutely clear that we will publish the findings of the report.” The steady stream of allegations over alleged breaches of lockdown rules have rocked No . Many of the PM’s critics, from all wings and generations of the Tory party, are waiting for Ms Gray’s report before deciding whether or not to submit formal letters to trigger a confidence vote.In a warning to wavering rebels, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested there would have to be a general electionMr Johnson is ousted. However, neither John Major, Gordon Brown nor Theresa May called one when they took over in No  mid-term.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyScotland YardJacob Rees-MoggLiz TrussTheresa MayBoris JohnsonCressida DickJohn MajorGordon BrownCivil servantsPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Romanian rescue dog had a devastating virus named distemper, which she fought with all her might to survive but left her with a permanent tremor. An angel lady in Romania nursed her back to health and taught her how to trust, before transporting her to a Manchester dog sanctuary.

On Monday, Dogs  Rescue shared the amazing news on theirFacebook pagein a touching post that read: “We know you’ll all be thrilled with this happy ending. Damaris has been adopted into a forever home.“We chose to rescue Damaris as she was a dog no-one  wanted. “She had suffered distemper as a pup, a highly contagious devastating viral disease which she fought with all her might to survive. “It left her blind in one eye and with a permanent tremor which made her a little dferent. “But we thought she was perfect and wanted to give this fighter a chance of real happiness. “She arrived from Romania on the happy bus in October. She was such a gentle girl. “We thought she may be with us a while in order to build her trust, but she was one of the ones that surprised us, and went on to foster within a few days and settled in brilliantly. “At the end of October, she went to live with Louise, her family and new fur brother Jerry, for her trial which we’re so pleased to announce has now become her forever home.”  Damaris’ new adopted owner Louise said: “Thank you so much for letting us home Damaris. It’s safe to say we all fell in love with her straight away. “She’s hilarious and fiesty and doesn’t let anything hold her back - she’s definitely the boss of the house! “She’s fitted in right away. If she’s not sleeping she’s playing with Jerry or telling him off when he snores. “When I saw her photo my heart melted and I knew I would do anything I could to give her a good le. “Her missing eye and tremors make her even more special to us. “Thank you to Emma for trusting us with her and also her rescuer who originally saved her for making this possible.” The Facebook post received more than , likes and  comments.One supporter wrote: “This brought a tear to my eye. She wouldnapost have stood a chance in a kennel rescue. Big thank you to her new family for giving her a chance.” Another said: “I’m crying with happiness for Damaris and her family… DR is awesome.” A third commented: “Another post from you that brought me to tears ....of happiness..... for one of your beauties finding their family.

At first I thought it was a plane about to crash, but I realisedit was a plane about to crash it wouldaposve been going down,” he said.The youngster, who attends Wellfield Junior School, posted the video online which has since attracted hundreds of views.  Mum Yvonne, , said: The children come out with rubbish all the time”. “So you donapost really pay a lot of attention to it. But then I saw the video and I thought: aposActually, thataposs weirdapos. I said: aposYouaposd better start looking out for a bit of rock, it might be worth some moneyapos. I was going to send them down to Ashton Park to see where it landed.Late last year the Mirror reported on a meteor that was captured by a Darlington local’s doorbell camera as it shot through the sky one evening.The doorbell camera was filming after a family cat activated the recordingjust in the nick of time.  Julie Richardson, from Darlington, in the north east, said she “didn’t quite believe it” when her husband, Lee, showed her what their new doorbell camera had captured. Julie’s family cat, Stanley, is filmed between two vehicles at the bottom of the footage and happened to be walking past at just the right time to set the camera rolling. After walking theof the car, Stanley sits down on the drive, where he stays put until the impressive display is over. He then turned around and scarpers back towards the house. The fireball was spotted in Peterlee and the Northumberland coast, with residents also commenting that they saw the meteor after Julie shared the footage on social media. Julie said: I didnapost quite believe it, my husband Lee was the one that spotted it. I just thought it was a firework but that didnapost make sense as the aposfireworkapos was going down not up.”She said she put it on Facebook “just to see what other people thought about it” and came to the conclusion that it was “definitely a meteor”.The UK Meteor Network also shared several images of a meteor spotted that same evening.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"d day hero who carried","story":"D-Day hero who carried wounded soldier over shoulder for  miles under fire dies at Denis Bounsall survived three dferent assault landings in eleven months, including D-Day, and won a Distinguished Conduct Medal for bravery.

Debate over what causes it has passed through the centuries and now physicist Emeritus Professor Brian Tanner and historian Professor Giles Gasper, of Durham University, have come across a reference to ball lightning while exploring a medieval text written more than  years ago. The account by the th century Benedictine monk Gervase, of Christ Church Cathedral Priory, Canterbury, pre-dates the previous earliest known description of ball lightning recorded in England by nearly  years, the researchers suggest.  Writing on June , , Gervase stated that a marvellous sign descended near London. He described a dense and dark cloud, emitting a white substance which grew into a spherical shape under the cloud, from which a fiery globe fell towards the river.Prof Tanner said: Ball lightning is a rare weather event that is still not understood today.Gervaseaposs description of a white substance coming out of the dark cloud, falling as a spinning fiery sphere and then having some horizontal motion is very similar to historic and contemporary descriptions of ball lightning.  If Gervase is describing ball lightning, as we believe, then this would be the earliest account of this happening in England that has so far been discovered. Before the text was revealed, the earliest report of ball lightning from England dates back to a great thunderstorm in Widecombe, Devon, on October  . Gervaseaposs Chronicle and other works now exist in only three manuscripts - one in the British Library, and two at the University of Cambridge. The Latin text was edited by Bishop William Stubbs in  and there is no translation into English. The researchers previously examined the monkaposs records of eclipses and a description of the splitting of the image of the crescent moon. Prof Gasper said: Given that Gervase appears to be a reliable reporter, we believe that his description of the fiery globe on the Thames on June   was the first fully convincing account of ball lightning anywhere. The findings are published in the Royal Meteorological Societyaposs journal, Weather.

I was told by the caretaker that it closed in . “A lot of capital was put into this site as it is enormous, with an opulent architectural design rarely seen in Thailand. The original site had over a dozen buildings aside from the main grounds, which included stables and both an indoor arena and outdoor playing field.  “The clock fountain, furniture, ornate staircases and decaying piano were the highlights for me, with the clock fountain being the most interesting  Dali-esque feature. “They really bring out an undeniable surrealist aesthetic.”  Dax added that he could understand why ghost hunters may pick up some activity in the abandoned location, as there were some definite ‘spooky’ spots. He said: “I have a Thai ghost-hunter friend who has spent time at the polo club with his paranormal team. “I’m not surethey found anything but wouldn’t be surprisedthey did, as the place, although beautul, has some spooky spots.  “Walking around the facility, it isnapost hard to imagine horses and riders scurrying around during and between matches, people having drinks at the bar and spectators watching the action on the fields. “The few short years that it was in operation must have been a sight to behold. “Nowadays, as is obvious from the pictures, everything is decaying and being overtaken by flora and fauna.  The aposfaunaapos being a pack of aggressive soi dogs, snakes and lizards, as well as the fish in a nearby canal, which seems to be a popular local spot to cast a line. “I really enjoyed visiting this location and would put it easily in the top  of my favourite abandoned sites in Thailand.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Abandoned placesThailand\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether. Here are the rules being removed today and what will remain. What restrictions will be removed when Plan B ends As of Today, Thursday, January , Covid passes for large venues will end. However, Boris Johnson said that venues would have the right to choose on whether or not they want to continue with the policy.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. Though the government no longer mandates wearing masks in any setting, Johnson added urged that people should still think about wearing a mask when in public environments, particularly in crowded or enclosed spaces. Restrictions on visiting care homes will also be eased. But Mr Javid warned that the end of Plan B shouldnapost be seen as the finish line. He urged people to continue taking protective measures including washing hands, ventilating rooms and self-isolatingpositive. Anyone who has yet to receive their Covid vaccines are also being urged to come forward. Which Covid rules will remain   Along with self-isolating for at least five full daysyou get a positive Covid test, the requirement to take lateral flow tests when travelling internationally will remain in place. While legal requirements stay in place for now, Johnson said he hoped to not have to renew self-isolation rules when they expire on March . He added that the aim is to remove the legal requirement for people to isolate after testing positive and replace it with advice and guidance as the virus becomes endemic.  For now, anyone planning to travel abroad need to book and pay for a Covid test before coming back to England - although this will change on February  from amyouaposre double-vaccinated. From now until then the test - either lateral flow or PCR - will have to be taken after you arrive back. If the test comes back positive, you need to self-isolate. Those who arenapost fully vaccinated need to book and pay for day two and day eight tests. You will also have to quarantine at home or the place youaposre staying for  full days. If youaposve been fully vaccinated then you donapost need to isolate for  days unless you test positive on or before day two.Everyone also needs to complete apassenger locator formbefore travelling back to the UK.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusPlan BOmicron iantBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Early data suggests that BA., a sub-iant believed to have emerged from a mutation of the Omicron coronavirus iant, may be both more transmissible and better able to evade vaccines than the more common BA. sub-lineage.Currently the BA. lineage accounts for % of all cases globally but in Denmark, the BA. has grown rapidly.In the last week of , it accounted for % of all Covid- cases. By the second week of , it accounted for % of cases. On Wednesday, it was reported that BA. had become the dominant strain in Denmark.In a national address on Wednesday, Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said: “There is no evidence that the BA. iant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious.”  Initial calculations by Denmarkaposs top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut, show BA. could be . times more infectious than BA.. So far, early data has not shown a dference in the risk of hospitalisation for BA. compared to BA.. There is some indication that it is more contagious, especially for the unvaccinated, but that it can also infect people who have been vaccinated to a greater extent, SSIaposs technical director Tyra Grove Krause said at the briefing on Wednesday. The BA. has been nicknamed “stealth Omicron” as it is poses a challenge for scientists to track, unlike the original Omicron that stood out on the widely-used PCR tests without the need for extra genome sequencing. The new strain shows up as being S-gene positive under PCR tests, whereas the BA. did not.  According to the World Health Organisation, BA. sequences have been reported in more than  countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Singapore and India. On Friday, the UK Health Security Agency designated BA. a “iant under investigation” – one level below a “iant of concern” – saying it could have a growth advantage. It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so itaposs to be expected that we will continue to see new iants emerge, Dr Meera Chand, incident director at the UKHSA, said. Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are signicant.  So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA. causes more severe illness than omicron BA., but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate.” In the UK, some  cases of the BA. sub-lineage have been sequenced, according to Reuters, and the UKHSA said early analysis suggested an increased growth rate compared to BA.. Imperial College London’s Tom Peacock, one of the first virologists to raise the alarm over Omicron, tweeted that very early observations from India and Denmark suggest there is no dramatic dference in severity compared to BA.. This data should become more solidin the coming weeks.” He added that there is likely to be minimal dferences in vaccine effectiveness against BA. and BA.. Personally, Iaposm not sure BA. is going to have a substantial impact on the current Omicron wave of the pandemic. Several countries are near, or even past the peak of BA. waves.

Iain Francis, , had recently retired to India and was enjoying his daily ritual of yoga practice at the riverside by his hotel when he accidentally fell into the water and drowned. The dad-of-three, from Moretonhampstead, is believed to have hit his head during the fall on March , , and is likely to have been unconscious by the time he went into the water.An inquest at Exeter’s County Hall on January , heard the family had endured a long wait for more information surrounding his death from the Foreign Commonwealth Office and Indian police authorities due to the coronavirus pandemic, reports Devon Live. The -year-old, who had no known medical conditions, was described by his daughter Angela as having been aposextremelyapos healthy and fit for his age and did yoga every day to help ease pain in his hips, knees and sometimes also his feet.  In a statement, she recalled: He went to India in October  to enjoy this retirement warmer climate where he could stretch and climatise. He intended indeed to come back in the spring. Mr Francis had previously been a plumber for many years but also had an extensive career working in microfinance as a financial consultant in foreign agricultural programmes. He worked in  countries including Nigeria, Vietnam and Bangladesh. After retiring he travelled to India on his own and had been staying in the district of Koppal in Karnataka. The location of his death was Hanumanahalli Thungabhandra River Gangavathi. His daughter recalled the majority of his trip had been spent near the sea in Goa. Angela said: He was a strong swimmer, although he did not attempt to go in the water much or for long periods in later years.  The manager of the hotel where Mr Francis was staying told police in India that every day he would do yoga and body exercises at a riverbank near the hotel. On the day of his death he left the hotel at .pm and at pm the hotel manager was informed he had fallen in the river. He recalled he had gone to the river and saw Mr Francis floating in the water wearing shorts, and his belongings were on the bank of the river. The police investigation confirmed Mr Francis had accidentally fallen down into the river and had hit his head on a rock on his way into the water. The conclusion was he had died by accidental drowning and there was no third party involvement. A post mortem examination conducted in India confirmed the cause of Mr Francisaposs death was drowning. It was noted that there were lacerations to his scalp and a deep injury on the left side of the top of his head. Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Philip Spinney said: “The deceased died from the effects of drowning.” Following the inquest, his daughters paid tribute to Mr Francis and said: Our dad was wonderfully caring, funny, sensitive and generous. He had a spirit, heart and presence like no one  and he will always be dearly missed.

We take a look at the latest new changes to the Highway Code being brought in for Rush hour can be a hectic time for people on two wheelsByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Jan | comments The Highway Code is set to have some crucial updates made to it this week. The changes are set to impact all kinds of road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.The changes are coming into play after a huge consultation with the public was conducted to find out what people wanted and how they used the roads. , people took part in the consultation, with the government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The new rules will work to make motorists more aware of cyclists and pedestrians, ensuring a safer experience for all road users.When are the Highway Code changes coming in January   The changes will be made from Saturday, January , with eight changes in total set to come into force. We take a look at all the ones likely to affect cyclists Road user hierarchy Three new changes are coming in that will impact road use hierarchy. This rule enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy.The government website says: The hierarchy places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. It does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly. People crossing at junctions  According to the government, the new update will mean that:When people are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction, other traffic should give waypeople have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, the people crossing have priority and the traffic should give way people driving, riding a motorcycle or cycling must give way to people on a zebra crossing and people walking and cycling on a parallel crossingA parallel crossing is similar to a zebra crossing, but includes a cycle route alongside the black and white stripes. Walking cycling and riding in shared spaces  Shared areas will ask that people on pushbikes respect the safety of people walking, although pedestrians too must take care not to endanger anyone. The government says: People cycling are asked to:not pass people walking, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle closely or at high speed, particularly from behind slow down when necessary and let people walking know they are thereremember that people walking may be deaf, blind or partially sighted avoid passing a horse on the horse’s leftPositioning in the road when cycling  The road position that cyclists take up when using highways is due to have updated guidance. The government will now ask cyclists to begin:riding in the centre of their lane on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions or road narrowings keeping at least . metresaway from the kerb edgewhen riding on busy roads with vehicles moving faster than themThis section of the code will also impact people riding in groups, saying they:should be considerate of the needs of other road users when riding in groups can ride  abreast - and it can be safer to do so, particularly in larger groups or when accompanying children or less experienced riders Cyclists are also asked to be aware of people driving behind them and let them overtakethey wish to. This might include moving into a single file or even stoppingnecessary.It also discusses that people riding bikes need to:take care when passing parked vehicles, leaving enough roomto avoid being hita car door is opened watch out for people walking into their pathOvertaking when cycling  Updates are expected about safe passing distances, as well as speeds. The government say this will include:leaving at least . metreswhen overtaking people cycling at speeds of up to mph, and giving them more space when overtaking at higher speeds passing people riding horses or driving horse-drawn vehicles at speeds under  mph and allowing at least  metresof space allowing at least  metresof space and keeping to a low speed when passing people walking in the road This also means waiting behind someone and not overtaking until it is safe to do so by meeting these spaces. The update will also confirm that people cycling may pass slower-moving or stationary traffic on their right or left, although they are advised to be careful as people they pass might not be able to see them. People cycling at junctions  When turning in or out of a side road you need to give way to people waiting to cross or who are already walking across. The government also say: Some junctions now include small cycle traffic lights at eye-level height, which may allow cyclists to move separately from or before other traffic. People cycling are encouraged to use these facilities where they make their journey safer and easier. If there are no separate cycling facilities on a junction, then people on bikes should behave in the same way as car drivers. This will mean, where safe, positioning yourself in the middle of your correct lane at junctions. When it comes to turning right, advice is be handed down for cyclists using junctions that involve making the turn in two stages:stage  - when the traffic lights turn green, go straight ahead to the location marked by a cycle symbol and turn arrow on the road, and then stop and wait stage  - when the traffic lights on the far side of the junctionturn green, complete the manoeuvre The new advice also adds that people on bikes have priority when going straight ahead on junctions.They have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise, the government says. People cycling are asked to watch out for people driving intending to turn across their path, as people driving ahead may not be able to see them. Cycling on a roundabout  Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should:not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundaboutCyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.

It said: “Owing to the premises location in relation to the highways around the town centre of Bolton, the applicant will need to submit some form of transport statement in order to justy the proposed change of use.  “The statement should provide a rough indication as to how accessibility to the premises will be controlled and how abuse of the one-way system on Gas Street will be prevented, as well as giving a rough indication of traffic impact from the proposed use. “In its present form there is insufficient information available within the submission for the Highway Authority to fully comment.” The drive-thru kebab restaurant will be considered by planners in Bolton after a period of consultation with neighbours.

Health experts have issued a medical warning regarding his activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic.Mr Jones, , himself told Derbyshire Live heaposs had a lot of people question him over why he does it, but believes they would understandthey saw the happiness it brings to the families he provides his free donations to. He said: Iaposm probably the worldaposs most prolic sperm donor with now being at  aposbabiesapos, well,  babies born, nine ongoing pregnancies. I might continue for another few years. Get to  anyway. I know of clinics and sperm merchants with greater numbers but they donapost donate, but rather sell semen. I think people would understand morethey saw the messages I get and the photos of the babies with very happy mothers. I feel the happiness it brings. I once had a grandmother message me thanking me for her granddaughter. I do it for free, though sometimes ask a bit for petrol. Itaposs illegal to charge and doesnapost seem right to take money when I have more than them. Mr Jones, who has three grown-up children of his own, said: It all started in May, over nine years ago. For some people, having children is very important as it was for me. I read in some newspapers the plight of some people that canapost have children. Reading the newspaper, it explained how people were using Facebook to make arrangements. I thought I could help so I put a post on one of the sites. I wasnapost expecting any response with me saying how old I was, but I had a lady in Derby contacting me within an hour asking me to help that evening.  Iaposve not advertised Iaposm a donor in years. It has not quite worked out as I had guessed, Iaposm just as busy now and have so many people contact me through people just talking, referring. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has issued a medical warning regarding Mr Jonesapos activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic. A spokeswoman for the authority said: As the regulator of UK fertility treatment and research we donapost have the powers to stop people from making their own arrangements for sperm donation but we do want to help them get the information and advice they need to make the best informed choices, which is why we always encourage both donors and patients to be treated at a licensed UK clinic. If arrangements are made outside of the clinic environment there can be medical and legal risks, for example, without the proper consents in place the donor is likely to be seen as the legal parent, with all the rights and responsibilities that involves. Clinics will also rigorously test all donors for medical and hereditary illnesses. That’s why we always encourage sperm donors and patients to go to a licensed clinic, where these medical and legal issues are taken care of for them, and where the welfare of the child is always of primary concern.  Mr Jones says heaposs been married since , but now lives apart from his we who he says is not at all happy about what he does.Back in , Mr Jones appeared in  Men  Babies, a Channel  documentary which follows the lives of four men who donate their sperm for free to women who contacted them online. A clip from the show was featured on Gogglebox, which has received more than four million views on Facebook. Of the  children he claims to have fathered, Mr Jones says heaposs met around  of the babies which are located within around a -mile radius of Derby, including in Birmingham, Stoke and Nottingham. After first making contact, Mr Jones says he then gets to know the couple, who are often same-sex or cannot have children of their own, and discuss when their ovulation cycle is. He said he then places the date on his planner, and when he gets the call saying ovulation is only hours away, he jumps into his van and drives close to where they live. Describing how he does it, Mr Jones previously told Derbyshire Live : I drive somewhere where Iaposm not likely to be disturbed and go into the back of the van and pull the curtains down. Then I take the cup and a syringe so the stuff canapost come out, put a bag under my arm and text them to say Iaposm outside and Iaposll be round in three minutes. If that doesnapost work sometimes they suggest I meet them in a car park. I can tell how nervous they are. No other donor does it from their van normally, they go to the front door and ask to use the toilet.

Shout - a text service for people struggling with their mental health - was Kate and Prince William’s first major project with Meghan and Prince Harry.It launched in May  following a £million investment from the Royal Foundation, when the royals were dubbed the Fab Four. However, today when visiting the service in Londonaposs Notting Hill, Kate was flying solo as she met volunteers and those who have raised funds for the organisation. Among them was a teenage Scout who raised £, for the service by sleeping outside in a hammock for a year. Kate met Leo Street, , and called him ‘an inspiration’ after he braved temperatures as low as minus five to raise money for the charity.The duchess, who wore a £ olive green Derek Lam dress and £ ASOS earrings, joked: “There really isn’t a big enough Scout badge for that. What you achieved is really inspiring.”“You must have had some impressive kit to keep warm,” she said.Leo, from Swanley, slept under a heavy-duty tarpaulin to shield him from the extremities of the weather.

He told the duchess his next fundraising adventure will be to cycle to Scotland during half term. Mark Ungless, , an analytics expert, said that children as young as  and under formed eight per cent of their texts – which are received mostly between pm and midnight “I told the duchess we were surprised by the number of very young people reaching out and the time too. It needs addressing,” he said. Kate’s visit to Shout was to mark the mental health text service reaching over one million text conversations with those in need and struggling to cope.Shout has seen usage on its  increase by  per cent since the start of the COVID- pandemic and Kate was hearing how it needs more volunteers to join to ensure it can meet growing demand.The duchess was also told that conversations taking place on the Shout can be used to provide insights on mental health in the UK, with suicide , depressionand anxiety or stress , being cited as the main reasons why texters have sought support. During the visit, Kate also viewed a live demonstration of the  before joining a small group of Shout Volunteers to hear about their experiences of helping those in distress. She was also shown how people have personally benefited from taking part in the service, including by gaining new skills and developing a sense of purpose and also met Cassie Waters who began raising money for Shout after using the service herself when she suffered mental health challenges in . During her visit, Kate also met clinical supervisors, volunteers, and fundraisers to thank them for their invaluable efforts to ensure that vital mental health support is available across the UK at any time of day or night.

The politan Police had issued an arrest warrant for Leon McCaskre three weeks before he brutally killed Yasmin Chkai on the streets of Maida Vale, west London on Monday morning. As the -year-old repeatedly stabbed the mum-of-two with a kitchen kne, a -year-old motorist allegedly ploughed his car into the killer. Paramedics were unable to save either Yasmin, a qualied childminder and masters student, or McCaskre. Before her death, the mum-of-two had told friend Adele-Sara Richards that he had put cameras in her flat and had stolen her mail and phone in order to get her personal information. Ms Richard said that in April  she messaged her to say: Heaposs had cameras in my house recording me for months. She went on: Heaposs stolen my mail, my phone, has access to all my personal data. I think he will kill me. Iaposve tried everything. Family members, including two young men thought to be her  and -year-old sons, said that the -year-old had a panic alarm installed in her flat. They also accused Scotland Yard of doing nothing to help the mum, who they said took a restraining order out against McCaskre and orced him three years ago. Records show that McCaskre was wanted for failing to appear in court on January  after breaching stalking orders banning him from contacting Yasmin, The Times reports.  Deon Nelson-Wright, a close friend and former flatmate of the mum, said she knew the psychotic man spelt bad news for her pal from the moment they met. She told The Mirror: I knew this was going to happen. I just knew it. He was psychotic. A petition has been launched dubbing the unnamed driver a hero and calling for him not to face criminal charges. On Tuesday he was released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of murder. A friend told The Mirror that the driver, thought to be a dad-of-three, was in shock and living in a nightmare.

Not only is she styled HRH, she is officially known as Princess Charlotte of Cambridge thanks to her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.However, it’s likely that her dad Prince William will take the throne making him King and her mum Kate Queen.And when this happens it seems that Charlotte will be in line for a unique royal title - even grander than her current one.That title is Princess Royal, which is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.  The title was first introduced to mimic the French royal title of Madame Royale back in the s. The current Princess Royal is the Queen’s only daughter Princess Anne, who was given the title in . However, royal expert and author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, Duncan Larcombe, told TownandCountrymag: “The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch. It is a title that remains for le, so Princess Charlotte will have to wait at least until the death of the current Princess Royal.

And it stems from his parentsapos titles - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge- as kings and princes have historically taken their surnames from their fatheraposs titles.Similarly, her older brother sister Prince George is known as George Cambridge at the school and when he is old enough to attend, it is like Louis will go by Louis Cambridge. The tradition was also adopted by their dad Prince William, who took the surname Wales in school and in the military thanks to his fatheraposs title of Prince of Wales.Prince Harryalso opted for the Wales surname.Officially, Mountbatten-Windsor is the surname for any of the Queenaposs descendants who need to use it.It merges the names Windsor - the royal family name - with Mountbatten - the late Prince Philipaposs surname after he became a naturalised British citizen.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Princess CharlottePrince WilliamRoyal FamilyKate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, Morrisons has confirmed they will welcome maskless shoppers, BBC reports.The retailers said visitors wonapost be forced to wear masks, but they will be encouraged in order to keep staff and other people safe. Downing Street rolled out Plan B at the start of December to battle the surge of Omicron cases. The measures are being lted from tomorrow because the mutation has already peaked, the government has said. Though no longer a legal issue, the Government is still advising Brits to wear a mask in enclosed or crowded spaces, and when meeting strangers.  Retail worker trade union USDAW is also urging shoppers to observe Covid safety measures. Speaking to the broadcaster, Sainsburyaposs said safety was its highest priority. The supermarket plans to put up posters and remind customers over the tannoy about their guidance. In a statement, they said: In Scotland and Wales face coverings remain mandatory for those who can wear them in our stores, in line with the latest government restrictions.  We continue to have a range of safety measures in all of our stores, including screens and sanitising stations. Department store John Lewis, which owns Waitrose, will be suggesting people wear masks but say it will be down to iniduals to make a personal choice. Meanwhile, electronics store Currys will ask staff to wear masks in-store and while delivering products. But customers will not be expected to do so.  We will continue to assess our approach based on infection rates and colleague feedback, the company said. Usdaw, which represents , retail workers, said the Governmentaposs move to end the measure was deeply disappointing while infections rates remain high. General secretary Paddy Lillis said: We hope all retailers will continue to put staff and customer safety first. Wearing a face covering is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with the public. Rail operators also plan to ask travellers to adhere to mask-wearing rules on their services.  Boris Johnson confirmed all Plan B measures will end tomorrow. This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether.

And she applauds the St Albans headteacher who is ripping up the rulebookEva Simpson says schools should scrap their hair rulesImage: Getty ImagesopinionByEva Simpson:,  Jan | comments Like most parents on their child’s first day of ­ secondary school, I was filled with immense pride.My son looked so smart in his new unorm – blazer, tie, shirt, gleaming shoes. I took loads of pictures to show family and friends.When we arrived at the school, a teacher pointed to my son and called out “can this boy’s parent come and see me I stepped forward proudly. I didn’t expect to be singled out for how well turned out and smart my son looked on his first day of big school. “Good morning,” said the teacher. “I’m just wonderingyou read the school’s policy on hair  Your son’s haircut is in contravention of that.” I was stunned. Contravention. What was he on about My son had a perfectly normal hair cut, one that he’d had all through primary school. A short crop, similar to one sported by US President Barack Obama. But as far as the school was concerned it was an “extreme” haircut because it wasn’t a number four or above. In other words it was too short. I won’t lie, I was so upset I was on the verge of tears. Of course in typical British fashion I apologised profusely and assured him it wouldn’t happen again. But I was fuming. It immediately created a ­ision when there didn’t need to be one and left a very bad taste. There have been too many incidents of black children being penalised for hair ­“transgressions”. So I was heartened to read about St Albans headteacher Julie Richardson who has ripped up the school’s rule book on hair and thrown it out of the window.Now kids can come in with cornrows, Afros, short hair, whatever, without being put into isolation and missing valuable teaching time.Too many unorm policies around hair are ridiculous. They ignore children’s cultural heritage. Black schoolgirls for instance have sometimes been banned from having braids as they’re classed as hair extensions, even though they’re neat and mean the child can get ready for school much quicker. This fosters resentment, all to the detriment of the child. Part of the problem is the lack of ­ersity among school governors. It’s a closed shop. Many schools, especially those with a large black student body, have practically no black representation among the governing body and that needs to change. So I applaud Ms Richardson. I hope more schools take a leaf out of her book.

They came across a lion cub called Christian in the pet department of Harrods department store and bought the animalJohn Rendall and Anthony Bourke with Christian the lion in their London home Image: SHARED CONTENT UNITByDeborah Collcutt:,  Jan | commentsThe trio were as common a sight in seventies Cha as mini-skirts and Mary Quant eyeliner, driving around in a convertible Mercedes, dining in the finest restaurants and partying with glamorous women. And one of them was a lion. Christian the lion cub was famous among the bohemian and glamorous social world which congregated in that trendy part of south west London and included The Beatles, Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix and Vivienne Westwood, as well as his owners Anthony ‘Ace’ Bourke and John Rendall, whose death at the age of  was announced today. The Lion Man of Cha, as Rendall came to be known, and Bourke were flatmates who ran a furniture store, coincidentally called Sophistocat. They came across Christian in the pet department of Harrods department store, where back in the day you could buy tapirs, snakes, monkeys, pumas and even lions as well. This was before the Endangered Species Act of , which made it illegal for exotic creatures to be sold to the public. For the princely sum of  guineas – about £, in today’s money – Christian was theirs.  The men set about feeding Christian from a detailed diet sheet supplied by Harrods: raw egg and vitamins for breakfast, raw meat — usually chopped beef or rabbit — for lunch and supper, and, as a special treat, a delicious marrow-filled bone at night. Local restaurants and butchers offered steaks that were past their sell-by date, and cut-price meat. But exercise soon became a concern as Rendall and Bourke didn’t know where to walk him in this densely populated and traffic-choked corner of London. The local vicar came to their rescue when he offered Christian the use of a churchyard, near the shop. When he was nearly a year old, Christian had grown rapidly and his owners heartbreakingly decided they had to set him free. Lion expert George Adamson agreed to rehome him at Kora reserve in Kenya, so two weeks after Christian’s first and last birthday in England in August, , they headed for Africa. When they took Christian for his first walk in the bush, they witnessed the animal instincts that would ensure his survival. Spotting a lost cow in the bush, Christian instantly froze and began stalking his prey, stealthily creeping forwards. George was worried about the cow’s horns and told the men to grab Christian.  For the first time ever, the lion turned and snarled at them, leaving the pair profoundly shaken by the transformation in Christian from a biddable pet to a deadly hunter. Although sad that it was time to say goodbye, the pair were relieved to see he possessed the instincts he needed to stay alive. “Once we’d got him to Africa, I think Ace particularly had a real sense of, ‘my God, we’ve done it. Phew’.” said John years later. “But it was also sad: this wonderful presence had gone.” A year later, in the summer of , the men ed to Kora to see George and, they hoped, Christian. George warned them not to get their hopes up as Christian, now the head of a small pride, hadn’t been seen for weeks. But when they landed in Nairobi, George was beaming. “The lions turned up this morning,” he said. “Christian must have known you were coming.” The moment he heard his former owners’ voices, Christian ran towards them, grunting with excitement. Watching the lb lion bounding towards them at about  miles an hour was a breathtaking moment – would he greet or attack them  Bracing themselves, suddenly Christian was jumping up, rubbing their heads, and running backwards and forwards between them as he tried to embrace both men at the same time. He knew exactly who they were. The wonderful moment of reunion was captured on film and has since been watched more than  million views on YouTube. “I look at the photos of that meeting and realise how overwhelmed I was by the powerful emotion,” Rendall said in an interview. “At that moment, the gulf between humans and lions had been blurred by sheer euphoria.” Rendall, who was found dead in his study on Sunday by his magician son, Max, said in an interview once: “Christian changed my le forever and I will never forget him.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Daily MirrorLions,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The condition means that the ligaments in Allesha’s spine are tense and tighter than usual, subsequently pulling her brain into her spinal canal which causes crippling headaches making sound and light unbearable for the teen.The potentially fatal condition can also lead to ‘internal decapitation’ or paralysis when the tension builds so much that these ligaments become severed. The former law student, whose dreams of becoming a lawyer were initially dashed by the devastating diagnosis, needed £, to fly to Spain and have an innovative new operation which will stop the malformation in her spine.

Allesha said: “The surgery is booked, all I need to book now is my flights and work out who is going to come with me. “I’m literally so happy it’s unreal, I can’t believe it. “The Mirror is the reason this has all happened, I donapost know where I would be without all these amazing people who have donated and the help I have had to raise awareness.  “Thousands of people have donated, some of them I’ve never met. “I rang my sister crying when we hit £,. I’ve had to take the last few days just to process it. “I never thought I would even manage to raise the money I needed, never mind do it in a few days.” Allesha had started looking for answers three years ago when she was struck down with daily headaches so severe that she can’t bear to look at light or hear anything louder than a whisper. The teenager was forced to give up her placement with a law firm and quit college just as she was about to go to university, instead spending her le confined in a dark quiet room.  Now her surgery at the Filum System clinic in Barcelona is booked for February  and Allesha will be supported by her boyfriend, Kieran, .

The latest figures mark an increase on the number of cases recorded this time last week, and mark a reversal on the downwards trend seen in infections following the New Year period.In recent days the number of new cases has hovered around the , mark after peaking at nearly , new cases in early January.Case numbers have substantially dropped since peaking around New Year’s - with , cases recorded on January . However, the lag between catching Covid and falling ill, and then falling seriously ill and dying, means death rates are spiking now. The UK recorded , cases yesterday and have once again increased today, suggesting the decline in cases has been brought to a halt.  The  deaths recorded over the  hours to Tuesday pm marked the highest number of deaths confirmed in one day since February  last year. New data suggests the Omicron strain caused unprecedented levels of coronavirus infection in England this month with the new iety almost completely replacing Delta.The highest prevalence was seen in primary school children at .%, while overall it was .% between January  and  this year. It means that during this period one in  people in England was infected with Covid. The latest figures come just hours before Covid Plan B measures are due to be axed in England tomorrow. This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country.UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. The scrapping of Covid tests required for travellers reentering the UK also signals the continuation of efforts to learn to live with Covid. The elimination of the tests, no longer needed from February , also led to a boom in bookings for people keen to escape for the February half-term of Easter break.Meanwhile the country is awaiting the publication of Sue Gray’s report into the ious Downing Street parties - which it’s thought could lead to the end of Boris Johnson’s leadership. The Met police yesterday confirmed they were investigating the number of potentially law-breaking ‘events’ thrown by No. throughout the pandemic.One of these ‘events’ was reportedly a surprise birthday party thrown for Boris Johnson which involved cake.Despite originally resisting calls to investigate any of the  reported parties which were thrown at ious stages during lockdown, Cressida Dick has confirmed that the police would look into the claims. The report by top civil servant Sue Gray has looked into the same events.

Iaposm not happy, I felt disappointed. I thought I might fancy a Subway so went to seethey had any offers in the leaflet. I turned it over and to my dismay I felt they were making a mockery of Veganuary, Jamie, from Norwich, said. Iaposve never seen any company, let alone such a big one, make a mockery of Veganuary. They include so many meats like aposSteakuaryapos or aposTurkeybreastuary, it was just a marketing opportunity for them  Iaposd rather they just promoted Veganuary, it was unnecessary to add all the other terms. This should be a time of promoting a more ethical option. I was just pretty dumbfounded. Iaposve never seen any other wording like that. Iaposll happily boycott them now.The -year-old, who has been a vegan for two years and was previously vegetarian for  years, took to Facebook to vent about the absolute p***take pamphlet to his followers, who branded it pathetic and f***ing vile.Subway UK  Ireland very disappointed with you making a mockery of Veganuary, he wrote.

Now the animal rights activist has vowed to boycott Subway despite having at least  within walking distance of his home as he feels the chain have undone their efforts to support plant-based eating. Jamie said: This is a month where it should really be hitting home that thereaposs other tasty options. I posted it online to seeanyone  had the same feelings as me, and an awful lot of people do. That was the first time Iaposve ever addressed a big company directly and Iaposve still not had a response from them. Itaposs a leaflet with six vouchers inside - only one of which is for their plant-based section. The rest apply to any of their meat or dairy products. Other than the post, people have been contacting me [privately]. The general consensus is that people arenapost happy. I do generally speak to like-minded people and they think itaposs degrading to the cause. I thought [Subway] had made a step in the right direction by bringing out plant-based options and theyaposve done a  now. Itaposs like theyaposve undone their efforts so far. After posting online, Jamie received a number of responses from unamused followers who agreed it wasnapost the best move for the sandwich chain. Pathetic. Wouldnapost go there anyway, one wrote, while another added: F***ing vile to use the Veganuary word and [to] add flesh aposfleshanuaryapos it is literally taking the p***. I’m pleased I’m no regular at this place. This poster is not funny, a third wrote, while a fourth commented: They can stuff it! Iaposll make my own rolls and a lot cheaper too.

But moving from Kent to Cheshire meant she also had to say a heartbreaking goodbye to her dog Jak, who had been a gt from Roy  years ago. The -year-old left the Bichon-Lakeland terrier mix with a relative who lived more than  miles away, which meant she didnapost get to see him very often. After hearing the story, staff at her care home hatched a plan to find him a local home so she would still get to see him. And before long employee Claire Dunnettaposs sister, Sarah Roberts, came to the rescue and adopted him - and Diana and Jak have now been reunited.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

Jak leapt up at me from the door and jumped on me and we had cuddles and kisses. Itaposs just like old times.  Regional activities coordinator Jodie Solaiman, , and relatives had seen how distraught Diana was at being so far away from her -year-old dog and put out a plea to rehome him somewhere local. Luckily local Sarah Roberts jumped at the chance to make a dference and travelled to pick him up from Kent the next day. Sarah said: As soon as I heard about Jodie looking to home Jak closer to Diana I just thought, aposIaposll have him. Iaposm local so I can pop to Redwalls any time and the dference it will make to Diana is immeasurable!apos So much so, my children and I travelled to Kent the next day to collect Jak and the reunion was so happy and emotional that I knew I had made the right decision. Diana was very surprised when she found out the news. When I told Diana that weaposd found Jak a home just five minutes away she couldnapost believe it, Jodie said. She was in tears with happiness. Jodie also managed to capture the moment the pair were reunited for the first time in over a year. An excited Jak jumps up onto Dianaaposs lamp straight away after seeing her.

Two years into the coronavirus pandemic, normal le is slowly ing in England, with the easing of restrictions and rules. Despite Covid rates increasing thanks to the Omicron iant, the hospital admission rate has decreased. Even so, itaposs important to do all we can to avoid spreading Covid. Itaposs well known that certain places and activities can increase our risk, but a new study has offered clear estimates about the risk of Covid infection.So which activities are safe, and how safe exactly are they  Researchers have published a study in the peer-reviewed Environmental Science  Technology journal calculated the exact risk of catching Covid in ious environments. Where youaposre most likely to catch Covid  Displayed in a handy chart, the study has lists the percentage likelihood of becoming infected in dferent situations. For example,youaposre sitting in a crowded cinema with a mostly unmasked audience, thereaposs a % chance of being infected, assuming everyone in the room is silent. However,there are some people talking, the odds of infection jump to %. If the audience is masked, the risk of infection drops to a mere .%they stay silent, or %there is talking. Unsurprisingly, the risk of catching Covid is lowest in outdoor areas, and the risk is loweredpeople stay silent and wear a mask.  For example,youaposre standing with someone outside for a short period of time, and neither of you are talking, there is less than .% likelihood of catching Covid outdoors.

If the area is poorly ventilated, there is a .% chance, according to the study. The chance of catching Covid increasesthe place has a high volume of people. Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell.

The things that increase your risk are:Gathering together with lots of people in an enclosed space with poor air quality, such as an under-ventilated gym, nightclub or school classroom Doing something strenuous or rowdy such as exercising, singing or shouting Leaving off your masks Staying there for a long timeTo avoid catching Covid, the study recommends keeping in the green or amber spaces of the table.  That means: If you must meet other people, do so outdoors or in a space that’s well-ventilated or meet in a space where the ventilation is good and air quality is known.Keep the number of people to a minimum Spend the minimum possible amount of time together Don’t shout, sing or do heavy exercise Wear high-quality, well-fitting masks from the time you enter the building to the time you leaveThe study stresses that while the chart gives an estimated figure for each situation, the actual risk will depend on the specic parameters, such as exactly how many people are in a room of what size.

Cameron Newsom, , first developed a white spot on her tongue and was referred by her dentist to the local hospital for a biopsy. The spot was not painful and, when the results came back negative for any signs of cancer, she and her husband Anthony, also , and their son Hudson, , were told not to worry.But a year later, Cameron, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, developed another identical spot and was admitted to hospital again for a deeper, more invasive biopsy, Bristol Live reports. The results once again showed no signs of cancer but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots.  Months later, her tongue became sensitive and sore, and immediately contacted her dentist. She was given antibiotics to combat any potential infection but her condition continued to worsen, as the original spots had transformed into a pinkish tumour on the left side of her tongue. She was sent for further tests and a third biopsy and after being referred to an ear nose and throat specialist, Cameron was diagnosed with stage four squamous cell carcinoma – skin cancer of the tongue. Cameron said: At the time of my diagnosis Iaposd lost over seven pounds because I was unable to eat or drink. It took three years from when the first spot originally appeared for doctors to finally diagnose me - no one ever mentioned it could be oral cancer. When I was told, it seemed like I was being handed a death sentence there and then, but straight away my reaction was Iaposm ready to fight this. I was  at the time and in very good shape, so I couldnapost understand why this was happening to me.  When I got home that day I googled my type of cancer and as you can imagine the results were absolutely terrying. There were images of people after having their jaws removed or sawed in half - Iaposd never been so scared. Cameronaposs diagnosis came in May  and she was scheduled in for three rounds of chemo, starting in July and finishing in September that year. Throughout that time, she was unable to eat or drink anything without suffering excruciating pain - all whilst undergoing grueling cancer treatment. There would be times at the dinner table where I would just burst into tears because I couldnapost eat a thing, she said.results showed no signs of cancer - but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots. Hudson, who was five at the time, didnapost know why I was always so upset and it got to the point where I couldnapost physically speak to him or my husband. A low point for me was when I went to a party with all my closest friends and I had to leave because my mouth was in so much pain. I went home and took a shower to calm down, and thataposs when clumps of my hair started falling out - it was so upsetting. Thankfully for Cameron, her chemotherapy was successful and as a result the tumor had shrunk a considerable amount. Her body had reacted well to the treatment, but the next part of her recovery was to have the tumor completely removed. She then flew back and forth to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas to meet with some of the best oral surgeons in the country and organise the operation. On December , Cameron went under the kne, and oral and plastic surgeons worked together to remove the left side of her tongue. In what was a nine-and-a-half hour operation, they then replaced that part of her tongue with skin and muscle tissue from her thigh. Surgeons then performed a Tracheotomy on Cameron, where they sliced a hole between her two collar bones and inserted a tube into her neck so she could breathe. The mum also had a feeding tube taped to her nose so she could ingest vital calories which were desperately needed to help her body recover. Read More Cameron said: They usually take skin from your forearm, but I’m only five foot two, so I didn’t have enough skin on my forearm to replace what I was having removed. However, Iaposve been an athlete all my le, and there was plenty for them to use from my thigh - so thataposs what we decided to do. The oral surgeon removed part of my tongue, and the plastic surgeon took muscle and skin from my thigh to replace it. When I woke up I had tubes coming out my neck and nose which allowed me to breathe and eat. The next few weeks were hell because my mouth was so swollen I couldnapost swallow or breathe unassisted. I had to be under constant observation and every time my throat had a build up of blood and body fluid, it had to be flushed away using water. That was basically like being waterboarded by the nurses once or twice a day which was absolutely horric. The weirdest part of the whole experience was when I felt a rough texture on the thigh part of my tongue - and when I looked in the mirror it had started growing leg hair! For nine weeks after her surgery, Cameron underwent  rounds of radiation and another three rounds of chemo to rid of any remaining cancer cells. In that time she was unable to speak, and for six months had to use a tube inserted in her stomach to eat and drink whilst her wounds healed. From then on, Cameron started getting used to le with her new tongue - which included relearning how to speak, chew, drink and swallow. I had to teach myself how to speak again after the radiation therapy which was a really bizarre feeling, she said. I can only taste on the right side of my tongue which is the real side, and only chew on the right side because the left is attached to my gums. My manners are terrible because food sometimes just falls out my mouth, and when food gets stuck underneath my tongue it feels like having a small rock in your shoe. Because the left side is sewn to my gums I donapost have the full range of motion I used to which can be frustrating. A feeling I could compare it to is like having a dead arm or dead leg all the time - it is constantly tingly and numb. Only the healthy side produces saliva and I cant stick my tongue out my mouth at all, so licking things is a big no no! Itaposs now been nine years since my diagnosis and thereaposs been no signs of regression. The longer you go without regressing the less likely it is the cancer will come back, so were all feeling really positive.  was the toughest year of my le and I couldnapost of done it without the support of my amazing Antony and the rest of my family. In June , once she proved she could eat and drink unaided, Cameron ed to her job as a gymnastics coach and was finally able to start living le again. She has since mentored several other people whoaposve been diagnosed with the same cancer as she was, offering them support and guidance throughout their treatment.

Andrew Pougnet and his we Sabrina Pougnet, both  from Ontario, Canada, moved into their home in June  and discovered the pool that hadnapost been used for around two decades. It was covered with decking and during that time, it had slowly filled with debris and rainwater, causing it to develop its own ecosystem at the bottom, like a lake. We started renovations on the home the day we got the keys, Sabrina said. We finished almost the entire main floor before working up the courage to tackle the in-ground pool this past summer.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. We had learned from the original owner when we bought the home that it would take a lot of work to get the pool up and running and ultimately restore it to its previous glory days. The couple were told by neighbours that it had been around  years since the pool had last been in use, which made them consider getting some extra help. Sabrina said: Initially we had reached out to local pool companies to seewe could hire someone to restore it for us, as neither of us had any experience, but our emails went unanswered likely due to the high demand for pools due to covid. Andrew and I didn’t knowthe pool structure would even be salvageable until the deck was removed - as it sat for so many years collecting rainwater and debris with a damaged liner. Finally, we decided to try restoring it ourselves and share the process as a series on our TikTok account. After Andrew, who works as a carpenter, and Sabrina, who is a recreation therapist, removed the deck, the couple could immediately see the rust on the walls they had feared. She added: We were worried that the pool may be too damaged to try restoring,that was the case, it was about to be the shortest TikTok series ever! Luckily for us, after draining the water and cleaning out the debris, we could see that the pool structure was salvageable, aside from minor surface rust which Andrew removed to prepare for a new liner. We knew it was going to be full of water and that there was a good chance of many dead critters and debris. However, we were surprised by the lack of smell, you would think that having a swamp of a pool for so many years, the smell would be unbearable, but it really didn’t smell at all! Even after draining the water to expose the ecosystem at the bottom of the pool, the smell was comparable to that of seaweed at a beach - a little fishy but not that bad. The couple completed the entire restoration in just over one month, starting in mid-July  and finishing in September . The work cost a total of ,to complete but they now have a safe pool to enjoy. They shared the restoration on TikTok, creating a series that showed their work on the old pool, with the first post racking up more than  million views and two million likes. Viewers were left ided by the outcome – with many saying they couldnapost step foot in there after seeing it filled with dirt and debris. One person said: I’d never step in that pool no matter how clean it is after. Y’all brewing covd  in there, another user joked. Someone  commented: I just know the smell coming out from under that deck was NASTY! So glad y’all made it awesome!!!. IMAGINE FALLING INTO THAT IF THE DECK BROKE OMG, exclaimed another.

Sharing her story anonymously on Mumsnet, the woman explained her friend is also currently pregnant and when her announcement was made, she splashed out on flowers and apregnancy hamper and began calling her every day to see how she was getting on.When the mum then fell pregnant a few months after her friend, she expected her tothe favour and be just as excited for her - but so far, she has been consciously not celebrating the womanaposs pregnancy news. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: My best friend found out she was pregnant last Autumn after trying for a year. I was so thrilled for her, I sent flowers the day after she told me the news, made her a pregnancy hamper, showered her with love, and checked in on her every day to see how she was getting on. I askedsheaposd be happy for me to think about baby showers for her when sheaposs further along and started sharing ideas with her. Once my friend conceived I told her that I wanted to start trying and she was very supportive. She knew I was holding off for her to get pregnant, as I already have a toddler who I conceived straight away so thought it could possibly happen again. She was fine up until I conceived in the first cycle and told her I was due two months after her. She seemed in shock that I was pregnant and I think some of it could be that it was so quick for us in comparison to her journey. The mum said she feels disappointed that her friend hasnapost made any effort to check in on her, and said that while she would usually make a big deal out of important events, she seems uninterested in her pregnancy.  She added: A few months on, despite me still checking in on her almost every day, she doesnapost ask how Iaposm doing orany of the love and support I give her. I donapost expect gts like the ones I gave her, but as an example, weaposre planning a meal out as a big group and I askedshe had any cravings or aversions so we could decide around that, but she didnapost ask about me. Sheaposs the type of person who would normally make a big deal about this , so feels like sheaposs consciously not celebrating my pregnancy. This is my best friend of  years so I was expecting her to be excited weaposd be on Mat leave together and experience this together. But commenters on the Mumsnet post were baffled by the mum, as many of them said she was being over the top and putting too much pressure on her friend - especially when sheaposs also going through her own pregnancy journey. One person wrote: You are very over the top. It would make me very uncomfortablemy friends reacted like that to a pregnancy announcement. While another said: I think your friend is probably feeling somewhat smothered, and maybe you should back off a bit. Sheaposs probably fine, and thinks you are too. And a third added: As lovely as your intentions are, it all sounds a bit suffocating to me personally. Also, it sounds like this is your friendaposs first pregnancy and your second one  So youaposve been through all this before, why do you need special handholding the second time around  I understand wanting a bit of support, but it all just sounds a bit intense and needy.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyUmm what Parenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite it being traditional for wives and children to take on the manaposs last name, the mum-to-be decided against this when she married her hubby three years ago.At the time, however, they came to an agreement that any future children would take on his name, to appease his traditional family - but with their first child on the way, the woman has now grown to regret her decision.When I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already discussed this and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.But recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husbandaposs family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and in-laws are ridiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it.  The woman went home and told her husband sheaposd changed her mind about their childaposs last name, and had decided she wanted their son to have their surnames combined, or she would be changing his name to hers. He was confused saying we had an agreement and then asked what was the cause of this sudden change of mind. I told him and he said I canapost just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that Iaposm the mother I get a say too, she continued. We went back and forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son, asmy last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just aposdealapos with it now but I wonapost accept it. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether others also agreed with her husband, or whether they thought she too made a valid point. You literally mention that you’ve had this promise at least since you were married and have both discussed and agreed! He is right to be upset knowing you have already agreed and it’s a big deal to his family, which you are aware of, one Reddit user commented. It must be out of nowhere for him, yes you are the we and future mum but that doesn’t mean you can just switch sides and go back on your word whenever you feel like it. Meanwhile another added: Hyphenated is a reasonable compromise, but you’re still an a**hole for agreeing to give them his name and going back on it now that it’s time to follow through on your word.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Image: Jam Press Ben TucciByJulia BanimRia Newman:,  Jan | comments A man from Ontario, Canada has gone viral after sharing images of two sinister-looking ice figures outside of his home, both of which bear a striking resemblance to the Grim Reaper. Ben Tucci, , was surprised by the ominous formations which had appeared outside his Lake Erie lakehouse in the town of Dunnville and shared a series of striking photographs on Facebook.Benaposs Facebook friends couldnapost help but shudder at the sight of the tall, humanoid figures, clad in what appears at first glance to be floor- white cloaks. The chilling vision, described as the stuff of nightmares by one follower, brings to mind the personied figure of death himself: the Grim Reaper.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Ben said: My initial reaction was one of awe. I couldnapost believe my eyes. On the first formation, I thought this is Jack Frost, Old Man Winter, Father Christmas, or perhaps even the Grim Reaper. My immediate reaction to the dejected looking figure was of an eerie looking woman or a sea hag of sorts, leaving the property almost asto be walking away from Jack Frost.He believes that the spectral figures do have an everyday sort of explanation. Water from the lake’s waves has recently landed on his next-door neighbour’s lamp post, thus creating the two menacing aposvisitorsapos Ben has since nicknamed Jack Frost and Grim Reaper. However, in a further unsettling twist to the tale, after Ben showed his daughter the photographs, she recognised the looming figures as being “spirits” that she believes have been visiting her in her dreams. Ben continued: “My youngest daughter had previously told us that she would have nightmares when sleeping in her lakeside bedroom in the old cottage – such that sheaposd sleep on the couch at times. When I showed her the pics of the ice formations she was stunned. She told me that the dejected-looking figure with head bowed was the image she had been tormented by in her dreams. Interestingly, Benaposs daughter hasnapost experienced such nighttime visitations at their new home, which he views as being almost like the old cottage was inhabited by a spirit which departed after the demolition. The photos have since been liked on Facebook more , times, clocking up hundreds of alarmed and fascinated comments. One person remarked, “If the Angel of Death looks like this when he she comes to get me, I’d be running on water away from it, while another shivered, I’m just saying thatI lived near there, I wouldn’t be sleeping for the rest of the winter.Have you had a strange or unusual encounter  Email us at yourmirror@mirrorRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowGhosts\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As it spins through space it sends out a beam of radiation, and for one minute in every twenty minutes it is one of the brightest objects in the sky. Researchers think the object could be a neutron star or a white dwarf - collapsed cores of stars - with an ultra-powerful magnetic field.Astrophysicist Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker, of Curtin University, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Researchin Australia, who led the team that made the discovery, called it spooky. She said: This object was appearing and disappearing over a few hours during our observations. That was completely unexpected. It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because thereaposs nothing known in the sky that does that. And itaposs really quite close to us - about , lightyears away. Itaposs in our galactic backyard. Dr Hurley-Walker added that the observations match a predicted astrophysical object called an ultra-long period magnetar. She said: Itaposs a type of slowly spinning neutron star that has been predicted to exist theoretically. But nobody expected to directly detect one like this, because we didnapost expect them to be so bright. Somehow itaposs converting magnetic energy to radio waves much more effectively than anything weaposve seen before. Curtin University Honours student Tyrone OaposDoherty discovered the object using the Murchison Widefield Arraytelescope in outback Western Australia - and a new technique he developed. He said: Itaposs exciting that the source I identied last year has turned out to be such a peculiar object.

Objects that turn on and off in the universe are not new, and astronomers call them transients, with some appearing over the course of a few days and disappearing after a few months, and others flashing on and off within milliseconds or seconds. However, ICRAR-Curtin astrophysicist and co-author Dr Gemma Anderson said finding something that turned on for just a minute made the new discovery unusual. She explained that the mysterious object was incredibly bright and smaller than the sun, emitting the kind of radio waves that suggested it had an extremely strong magnetic field. The researchers are now monitoring the object to seeit switches back on, and plan to search for ore of these unusual objects in the vast archives of the MWA. More detections will tell astronomers whether this was a rare one-off event or a vast new population weaposd never noticed before, Dr Hurley-Walker said. The findings are published in the Nature journal.

A whole body can be frozen for slightly under £, while just the head and brain costs around £,. The process, known as cryonics, is being offered by the Alcor Le Extension Foundation. Alcor runs under the belief that science and technology will advance to the point that it can bring back the dead in the future.Bodies are sent to Scottsdale Arizona, where the company is based, and stored at deep freeze temperatures for decades or even centuries, reports The Sun.Experts slowly lower the temperature and store the bodies in a giant vessel of liquid nitrogen at - degrees.

Nato is bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea regionRussian President Vladimir Putin Image: Alexei Nikolsky TASSByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  Jan | commentsRussian air force chiefs sparked an attack scare by planting war plane transponders on military vehicles, it was claimed tonight. The ruse looked like  military planes grouping up and moving in circles at west Russian airports close to the Ukraine border.If it was a “spoof manoeuvre” security experts suspect it was to hide another “activity” happening where and keep NATO guessing. British Rivet Joint spy planes are known to have been flying patrols over Ukraine to hoover up Russian radio chatter and other communications. They are there to provide an early warning of where and when an attack might be launched by Russian forces moving into Ukraine.  Alarmingly Moscow’s air force planes have been steadily increasing in number in airports to the west of Russia without being involved in exercises. Around , Russian combat troops are gathered close to the Ukraine border, along with , pro-Moscow separatists in contested Donbas. Russia also has a large number of regular and special forces bolstering Donbas separatists, although Moscow has repeatedly denied this. An expert in Russian military matters told the Daily Mirror: “I havenapost seen anything like this before. Air force people in the UK are baffled.  “Circuiting round and round and up and down a large airfield is not a recognised manoeuvre. “These aircraft could be seen moving all day, burning fuel. “So it was likely a spoof with jeeps or cars meandering around with transponders on them. “This could mean not that nothing is happening, but something is happening where that we cannot detect.  Russia has warned it would quickly take retaliatory measuresthe US and its allies reject its security demands regarding NATO membership. Russia has demanded guarantees that Nato will never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in ex-Soviet bloc countries. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he and other top officials would advise President Vladimir Putin on the next steps after receiving written replies from the US to the demands. He said: If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures. Nato is bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region and the US ordered , troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. Western nations including the UK have also sent plane loads of weapons to help Ukraine strengthen its defences.

Lucy Anne, from New Jersey, US, first realised her desire to revert back to infancy at the age of nine but only began acting like a baby aged . The cyber-security analyst spends her time at home lounging around in nappies, onesies and dummies while also selling pictures of herself dressed as a baby online. Despite this, Lucy claims she does not dress up as a baby for sexual reasons, but for comfort and acceptance after years of resenting how she felt. She said: “These feelings and desire to revert to a baby-like state started when I was really young. “I didn’t understand them at the time and I grew up hating how I felt. “As a teen, I experimented by wearing diapers and started to explore the ‘adult baby diaper lover’community after thinking about it for over ten years.  Lucy said she became involved with the ABDL community with an ex-partner, who was also part of it, and has since worn onesies and nappies to relax at home.She added: “I opened an Instagram to share my images because I feel cute and will sometimes get direct messages where people will ask me for specic photos or will just send me money because they like my content.“I’ve made £ from commissions but I’ve probably made more from people who have sent me money to buy new stuffed animals, paciers or diapers. “I actually have one contributor who actually sends me £ of adult diapers each month.” Lucy’s acting age range is between three and five years old and she tries to immerse herself in the experience as much as possible. She said: “I really want the experience of being a baby to be as realistic as possible and knew I couldn’t just do that with a diaper. “I use the diapers for the reason they are intended for and find that it actually helps me sleep through the night without being disturbed by weak bladder issues. “I sometimes will wear a diaper to work, hidden under everyday work clothes. “I have a collection of paciers, pyjama onesies that have a flap on the bottom for easy access and lots of cute fleece blankets. “Stuffed toys also make up a big part of my baby collection, and I also have a few cat ears to match. Due to her interests and desire to revert back to a baby, Lucy often gets requests she is uncomfortable with as well as struggling to reveal her lestyle to some family members and friends.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

This is necessary at any reputable investment site, and the good news is that it doesn’t take very long to do. So without further ado, here are the steps you must follow:Getting Started With eToroTo start buying stocks online, we recommend that you sign up with eToro.

And with eToro offering a wealth of trading options, markets, and stocks overall, you won’t be disappointed by your experience here.gtgtgt Trade stocks with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerHow to Fund Your AccountDebit CardMost of us own a Visa or MasterCard debit card. These are connected to our primary bank account in most cases, and naturally, you must enter your card details to execute a deposit with this method. Not everyone feels comfortable doing this, even with the latest SSL encryptions being used for online payments at top sites. However,you don’t mind sharing such information, debit cards are arguably the quickest and easiest way you can fund your account.Credit CardCredit cards are obviously a little dferent from debit cards. While yes, they are also connected to your bank account, these cards let you spend money that you might not have readily available. You’ve also got added payment protection with credit cards, which is why many people like to use them for more substantial purchases. Much like debit cards, credit card transactions will come through instantly.PayPalUnless you already have a PayPal account, you’ll need to set one up. This is free to do, and it takes just a few minutes. Regardless, it still means you’ve got the hassle of setting up an account before using it, making PayPal less convenient than debit or credit cards. However, once your account is set up, you can enjoy some awesome benefits including top-tier security, higher deposit maximums, as well as   fraud detection services for your account.Bank TransfersBank transfers have a nice degree of security to them since you must manually perform and approve the transaction. This payment option also tends to have higher deposit maximums, and with the introduction of ‘rapid transfers’, deposits are now processed almost instantly with bank transfers. The one and only downside is that there is always the possibility of human error here. That’s because you must accurately enter the bank details for your investment provider, and there is usually an extra reference code related to your personal account too.Skrill NetellerSkrill and Neteller are two dferent digital wallets that you may also use to fund your stock trading accounts. Much like PayPal, these guys are third party providers that boast higher deposit maximums, instant transactions, and top-level security features. You can also manage accounts in multiple currencies with Skrill and Neteller.gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerWhat to Consider When Buying StocksMaking the decision to get involved in the stock market isn’t one to be taken lightly. After all, stock markets can be volatile, and picking inidual stocks to trade can be even more so. On that note, you can manage the risks involved with stock investing by taking the following into consideration:VolatilitySince we’ve mentioned volatility above, we may as well start with this one. Volatility simply means that stock markets can go up and down in value. This is true of the broader indexes, as well as the stocks that make them up. So before you invest, you have to be prepared to ride out those ups and downs.Account FeesFees are extremely important when buying and selling stocks. Basically, the more you can wipe out any unnecessary fees, the better. That’s why we love s such as eToro, as they have removed trading commission, deposit fees, as well as other fees that are common with less popular sites. Of course, the more you can reduce these fees, the more cash you’ll have to trade with.Investment IntentionsBefore you get involved in the stock market, it’s important to assess what your actual intentions are. Some people like to simply invest in index funds for a less volatile and more predictable , but these s won’t exactly make you millions overnight.

Measures to control the spread of the virus will have widened health inequalities: those with high income, high security jobs have been able to protect themselves from the virus those with low income, low security jobs have not.“Moreover, there is evidence that the virus has made a heavier impact on people with obesity and among ethnic communities, both of whom are overrepresented in more deprived sectors.” and maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Gains in le expectancy for femalesand maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade\" class\"editor-image\"Gains in le expectancy for femalesand maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade Prof Kerr, who was born and educated in Maryhill and previously produced an NHS blueprint for the then-Scottish Executive in , said the “fundamental challenge” was to “reverse the longer trend towards a more unequal Britain”. This should include devoting more healthcare spending on prevention, he said, which is “signicantly underfunded”.Glasgow’s Maryhill and Springburn constituency - Scotland’s most deprived - could host a new research hub to pool expertise on tackling health inequalities from across the Marmot City network, which should include “all of our major cities”.Prof Kerr added that central governments at Westminster, Holyrood, Cardf, and Stormont must provide Marmot Cities with the “powers to act by devolving down control on health, employment services, housing, early years and education policies”.: Le expectancy widening between richest and poorest Labour MSP for Glasgow, Paul Sweeney, said: “ We cannot continue to see people pushed into poverty simply because of where they were born, and I would urge all governments across the UK to engage with these proposals seriously.”Scotlands Public Health Minister Maree Todd said: “It remains an unwelcome reality that communities experience health, quality of le and even le expectancy dferently across our society.“We already have in place a bold package of measures to improve population health which tackle issues such as smoking, obesity, inactivity and alcohol misuse – however, in order to fully address all aspects of inequality we need full control over economic, welfare and social policies, much of which is currently reserved to the UK Government.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cat-reunited-owner-11-years-away-aberdeen-home","story":"Fergus went missing from his Forres owner in late , but  years later was found by Cats Protection volunteers at a recycling centre in Aberdeen but it was only when his microchip was scanned they realised how far away from home he was.Fiona Mutter, his owner, soon after got the shock call to tell her that her cat was still alive and had been found  miles away.She said: “It was such a surprise to get the call that Fergus was alive. “He was always prone to wandering and would sometimes go off for a few days at a time, but one day he never came back. “We sadly assumed something had happened to him.“To hear that he was still alive and had ended up so far away was such a shock. “We adopted Fergus as a kitten from Cats Protection and he’d been with us for four years before he disappeared.”It is a mystery as to where Fergus has been for the past  years, but Cats Protection think it is likely he travelled in a vehicle to Aberdeen.Ms Mutter, who thanked the charity for going “above and beyond” to get Fergus home, added: “His coat is so shiny, and he’s so friendly, that there is no way he has been living outside all this time.“Someone has been taking good care of him.”And he is now settling in back in the familiar surroundings of his home, and has slowly been introduced to Ozzy, the other cat in the household.“He was soon happy to be handled and stroked, he has such a loud purr,” she said. “I did buy him a cat bed but he prefers lying on the actual bed.”Alice Palombo, the charity’s advocacy and government relations officer for Scotland, said it showed how important microchipping cats was and urged the Scottish Government to make chipping of cats compulsory."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13416270.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mary-queen-scots-letter-fetch-around-18-000-auction","story":"It will be sold at the live and online auction by fine art auctioneers Lyon  Turnbull on Wednesday, February .

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach.

Kyrgios missed a set point when he tried a shot through the legs but two big s from the -year-old ultimately proved the dference.The wild cards looked on their way when they broke in the second game of the second set but Kyrgios lost his serve at -, smashing his racket in anger and becoming frustrated with fans calling out before his serve. vw,vw,px, px\"Nick Kyrgios, right, and Thanais Kokkinakis acknowledge the crowd It appeared the match might have turned but Kyrgios and Kokkinakis saved their best ing game for the right moment.When a final lob from Kokkinakis dropped in, the duo threw their rackets high into the air before jumping into each other’s arms.Unlike previous opponents, Granollers and Zeballos had no complaints about the crowd or the antics of Kyrgios, with the bigger environs of Rod Laver making it less of a bear pit.Kyrgios was angrily confronted by the fitness trainer of Mate Pavic after their third-round victory over the top seeds, while New Zealander Michael Venus labelled Kyrgios “an absolute knob” following the quarter-final.“I think tennis is a sport, as of now, that’s never been talked about as much,” said Kyrgios. “We need more attention, we need more viewers. My goal is to only bring new fans that may not be following tennis to watch tennis.“If they flick on a match and they have Thanasi and I playing in an entertaining doubles match, they know nothing about tennis,they watch that match just then, they probably would tune in next time. That’s what I’m about. That’s what I want to bring. I think that’s how the sport is going to survive.“As to Michael Venus, I’m not going to destroy him in this media conference room right now. But Zeballos and Granollers are singles players. They’ve had great careers. I respect them a lot more than I respect Michael Venus.“I think the balance was there today. The quality of tennis was amazing. I think the festival atmosphere was still there. I think they embraced it. They knew it was an incredible atmosphere. Zeballos took a selfie with us before we walked out. That’s how you embrace an atmosphere.Surprise package 📦📦@mattebden and @MaxPurcell are through to the Men’s Doubles Final, upsetting No. seeds Ram Salisbury - -.

It’s ridiculous.“It’s not like I’m going out there putting on a clown suit and creating a circus. I have also played, won titles, won big titles, I have played the traditional way. I think now I’m able to channel a dferent fan base.”The contrast with the other semi-final, being played simultaneously, could not have been more stark, with fewer than  people watching Salisbury and Ram’s match.The second seeds had expected more of an atmosphere and were hugely disappointed with their performance, especially after missing four set points in the second set.They were bidding to play in the final for a third consecutive year, and the disappointment was compounded by missing out on being part of Saturday’s show. vw,vw,px, px\"Thanasi Kokkinakis jumps into Nick Kyrgios’ arms “It would have been fun to play in it,” said Salisbury. “It would have been a great atmosphere and you don’t often get to play in front of that. I think it would have been tough but we’d obviously have liked to have that opportunity.”How the atmosphere is affected by having two Australian teams in the final remains to be seen, while it is also likely to be a dferent demographic to the largely young crowd who have followed the pair so far, but Kyrgios took exception to that line of questioning.“We have four Aussies in the final,” said Kyrgios. “Can we stop iding which crowd is going to go for who. It’s f***ing awesome.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Demand was buoyed further by last week’s news of restriction-free travel from February .Mr Lundgren said the UK is “leading on bookings versus Europe for the first time since spring ”.It is “traditional beach and leisure destinations that are recovering the quickest”, he said.EasyJet said that, while Omicron is expected to continue to have a short-term impact on its performance in the quarter to the end of March, its flight programme will “ramp up” from just % of  levels in January to near pre-pandemic levels between July and September.Mr Lundgren said: “EasyJet produced a signicant year-on-year improvement in the first quarter, despite the short-term impact of Omicron in December.”He added: “Booking volumes jumped in the UK following the welcome reduction of travel restrictions announced on January , which have been sustained and then given a further boost from the UK Government’s decision earlier this week to remove all testing requirements.”Many destinations popular with UK holidaymakers continue to require coronavirus tests for arrivals, eventhey are fully vaccinated.They include Cyprus, France, Greece, Morocco, mainland Portugal and Switzerland.But Mr Lundgren said he expects testing for travel “across our network should soon become a thing of the past”.He added: “We see a strong summer ahead, with pent-up demand that will see easyJet ing to near- levels of capacity, with UK beach and leisure routes performing particularly well.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Covid passports will no longer be legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas but will still be needed to gain access to a club or to indoor unseated or partially seated events with  people or more.On Tuesday the Department of Health recorded , positive cases of Covid and five deaths in the past  hours.Joe said he hoped that an Executive meeting on February  would remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings to bring nightclubs and other entertainment venues into line with the rest of hospitality.And he said nightclubs had suffered more than any other hospitality setting throughout the pandemic. “It’s coming up to two years since restrictions were introduced and as of today, we’ve been closed for  weeks and open for eight,” he said.“It’s not commonly understood just how catastrophic restrictions have been for us. There have been so many dferent permutations of reopening, that people are confused by it all.“If, for example, you attended a seated concert or a comedy or magic show and wanted to stand up or dance, that hasn’t been possible for  weeks.“Without clarity, we’ve lost access to touring events. A band or DJ touring England and thinking about adding a show in Ireland is faced with a tough decisionnot sure what the rules are orthey might change at any minute.“Anyone who plays to a standing or partially standing audience might then prioritise where, so that’s been very dficult.” Joe said that while it was harder to arrange gigs hastily following last-minute lting of restrictions, the demand for nightclubs was still evidently there, particularly among students. Club nights at The Limelight are selling out fast from Wednesday through to the weekend and staff are gearing up for a busy period ahead. But he’s in no doubt about the upcoming challenges for the sector.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” he said.“But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel.”At the Kremlin nightclub, a deep clean of the premises was under way ahead of reopening and staff were brought in to ensure the sound and light systems were ready for Wednesday night.Allen Gordon said the last reopening had been ‘phenomenal’ and that he was expecting an even better turnout this time around.And he said he was hopeful for the future of the nightclub.“There has been a fantastic reaction on social media to the reopening of the club and we’re expecting a big crowd down come the weekend,” he said.“The response was phenomenal the last time we reopened and we’re expecting an even better reaction this time.“It’s been a dficult time with all the closures and reopenings but it looks like we’re coming out of it now and I don’t think this will happen again, all these restrictions being put in place.“Here’s hoping we’re at the tail end of it, plus we’re coming into the better weather. People want out.“The reopening of nightclubs is a much-needed boost for hospitality.”Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest CoronavirusNightclubs buzzing with excitement again after ‘grim’ months of closureMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today NI Coronavirus travel rules: Changes for arrivals from non-red list countries‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisLatestSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerMinister disputes evidence suggesting PM ‘authorised’ animal airlt from KabulGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminStrictly Come Dancing announces line-up for The Professionals tourCat reunited with owner after  years away from Scottish home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The building is being taken over by an art and drama group which, I believe, will have access to the required funding for a proper refurbishment.“We regard this as an exciting opportunity to literally move on to a site nearer the city centre, and we are most grateful that the Great Victoria Street Church is giving us such a warm welcome.“Our closing service this Sunday will include a number of special guests including several of our former ministers, and the Presbyterian Moderator, the Right Reverend Dr Bruce. It will certainly be a landmark occasion, and for some people an emotional occasion as well.”Over the years Windsor church, on the corner of the Lisburn Road and Derryvolgie Avenue, amalgamated with others in the South Belfast Presbytery. In  it merged with the former Broadway Presbyterian Church on the Falls Road, which is now an Irish Language Centre. Recently the Windsor members shared an Irish language service of worship at the centre.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Then in , Windsor amalgamated with Ulsterville Presbyterian Church on the Lisburn Road. Cecil Graham, a longtime Presbyterian and elder at Windsor said: “In  in response to the increasing number of immigrants coming to Belfast, the South Belfast Presbytery in partnership with the Council for Mission in Ireland established the International Meeting Point project on the Lisburn Road.“Partnership with the IMP has been instrumental in reviving the Windsor congregation, and many of its members attend our Sunday services.” In its heyday, Windsor was one of the most fashionable and influential Presbyterian churches in Ireland. Two of its ministers became moderators — Rev John Irwin in  and Rev William Corkey in . The Corkey family in particular made a signicant contribution to the wider work of the Church, including the establishment of Adelaide House and other care homes.Windsor church has also made an important contribution to the Mission Outreach of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and particularly in China and India. During the Second World War, Windsor missionaries were imprisonment by the Japanese.It has had eight ministers in its history, including Rev Steen.The church is on the list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. It was designed in  by the architects Young and MacKenzie who also designed the Robinson and Cleaver building opposite Belfast City Hall.Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest Northern IrelandSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminThe families are getting older but we’re not prepared to give up, says campaignerPrimce Andrew wants jury trial over sex assault claimsfresh bid to dismiss case failsVictims who left home to march for peace and never came homeLatestSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerMinister disputes evidence suggesting PM ‘authorised’ animal airlt from KabulGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminStrictly Come Dancing announces line-up for The Professionals tourCat reunited with owner after  years away from Scottish home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We’ve also sold a few of the Pentire botanical non-alcoholic spirits.“One of the few shops we’ve launched in is Carnbrooke in Lisburn.“They took the whole range and said the Noughty Wine and cocktails went really well, so we have repeat business from that.”The company is now working in partnership with Pentire, which is buying all the Soho Houses across Europe in Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Rome.In the near future the Crawfords also have a second meeting with a top local resort, which is “really keen on the Noughty Wine as an alternative for guests who aren’t drinking”.NoLo covers any beverage with an alcohol content of under .%.Beers in the range include Clear Head and Hola with lime.Ms Crawford explained that as the company “was starting from a standing start” at the end of last year, they “didn’t expect anyone to find us”.“We were amazed to get  internet orders in just a month without any publicity,” she added.“We’ve just launched our social pages so we were pleased that people found us without us having or building any profile.“People are actively looking for alcohol-free drinks because there is a change in attitudes.“People are starting to become more health conscious and there are a lot of young people in Northern Ireland who aren’t drinking alcohol at all.”Her observations compound the results of a recent survey which found % of us were now teetotal — a trend pronounced in younger people.Alcohol Change UK also estimated around six out of  people are ‘sober curious’ and actively trying to cut back on the booze.One in sixadults who drinks alcohol is planning to have a month off drinking for January , or one in sevenof all UK adults. This is estimated at . million UK adults — up from an estimated . million last year, a % increase.Ms Crawford said golf clubs have also started stocking some of the alcohol-free range as a result of a change in culture.“People are popping in for a coffee and then driving home — they’re not going to the golf club and having  pints and staggering home,” she said.Cocktailsand sparkling winesare most popular locally because non-alcoholic spirits are expensive.“People can’t get their heads around paying £ for high-end alcohol-free spirit,” she pointed out.Sainsbury’s and Tesco, meanwhile, both report that sales of NoLo drinks have seen massive rises year-on-year.The proleration of ‘mindful drinking’ — a term that has come to the fore during the pandemic with people paying more attention to how much alcohol they consume — is one of the main reasons for the boosted sales.Although the traditional low alcohol wines, ciders and beers have all increased in popularity, the most signicant hike is in completely alcohol-free spirits.Tesco said sales of its NoLo spirits have soared by % since the start of , while Sainsbury’s has seen a % year-on-year increase.According to Alcohol Change UK, nearly halfof adults have tried NoLo drinks.The drinks business, meanwhile, has reported that this sector of the market will have grown by over a thirdby .Since the concept of ‘Dry January’ began in , with just , people taking part in the UK, that has increased to , who officially participated at the start of this year.Many have managed to steer clear of booze since, buying non-alcoholic drinks instead.A  study by University College London, which analysed thousands of - year-olds over the course of a decade, found that increasing numbers of young people did not drink alcohol at all, and reported signicant decreases in the number who drank above recommended limits or binged.Most ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest Northern IrelandTruss to meet Stormont leaders amid mounting political tension over protocolSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminDon’t rule out Cltonville in title race just yet, warns former boss Marty QuinnThe families are getting older but we’re not prepared to give up, says campaignerLatestNHS staff Covid absences falling but still higher than before ChristmasTruss to meet Stormont leaders amid mounting political tension over protocolDecades of laughter came from the pen of Barry CryerCPR training to become part of NI school curriculumVeteran performer and comedy writer Barry Cryer dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dancing and indoor standing events in general are also now able to resume, and while Covid certication passports are no longer legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas, they are still needed to gain access to a club .While a lot of venues have opted to postpone their grand reopening until the weekend, restrictions officially eased for nightclubs as of noon yesterday, and many business owners throughout Northern Ireland were champing at the bit to get punters back through the doors as quickly as possible.In Belfast, Northern Ireland’s most popular LGBT+ venue, Kremlin kicked the night off at pm with resident DJ Ryan A, and the city centre’s Thompson’s Garage reopened at pm with their trademark hip hop and urban-themed Funkarama night.Outside Thompson’s, three friends — Adam, Caomhan, Ruairi— were more than ready to be back out #for good#. For Adam, it has been too long since he was in a nightclub with no restrictions. I was in Thompson#s two weeks ago, but it was table service and no dancing. I#d say last time I was in a full-on club was my secondyear, so two years ago.Despite clubs opening briefly back in October, the lads felt it #didn#t feel right to go but find that this time around, things seem more definitive.It felt like you were always waiting to go back into lockdown before, Adam added. But now it feels like you#re more allowed to go out.Caomhan said that the minute they heard last week that nightclubs would be reopening again, his instant reaction was: Right Wednesday night, let#s get out.Ruairi graduated from Queen#s University Belfast in December, but said he is planning to still make the most of his student party le now, adding: I missed my entire final year because of Covid.My entire final year, everything was closed. It was grim!Joe Dougan promotes clubs and events, including Shine Belfast, which owns the Limelight building. It is one of the city’s most renowned concert venues and had been restricted to comedy gigs and limited bar table service for long periods at a time during the pandemic. The nightclub itself has been closed for  weeks over the past two years, and only fully opened for eight, according to Mr Dougan.At pm last night though, it was clear to see how eager many of the Limelight’s lovers have been for theof its ‘UFO’ night. The ticketed event sold out well in advance of its re-launch.A regular midweek destination for students, UFO offers three rooms of tunes, two beer gardens and “insane production”.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” said Mr Dougan.He said he hopes that that an Executive meeting on February  will remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings, to bring nightclubs and other venues into line with the rest of hospitality. “But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel,” he added.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeQueen’s UniversityMore On The Executive OfficeHouseholders face a huge squeeze on energy budgets... and there may be no end in sightTribute: Stormont leaders issue message of tolerance for Holocaust Memorial Day PremiumTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at risk PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekPrison Service £m budget cut ‘unacceptable’Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest Northern IrelandSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminThe families are getting older but we’re not prepared to give up, says campaignerPrimce Andrew wants jury trial over sex assault claimsfresh bid to dismiss case failsVictims who left home to march for peace and never came homeLatestSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissionerMinister disputes evidence suggesting PM ‘authorised’ animal airlt from KabulGlentoran are looking no further than our next game, insists Conor McMenaminStrictly Come Dancing announces line-up for The Professionals tourCat reunited with owner after  years away from Scottish home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People around the world can see that we’re not prepared to give up. I know some of the families are getting older, and me myself, I could die, you know.“And I have a sister who’s passionate about this campaign and I would hope that she’d carry it on with good health.“That’s the one thing I do worry about, that I don’t make it to see prosecutions, because after that I wouldn’t care.“I just want equality for all those victims, and I mean all over Northern Ireland — equality and to be able to access the law, courts and have your case looked at independently.“Otherwise, the British Government should be taken to The Hague, because successive Governments have covered up those crimes.”The  Saville Report and apology by David Cameron exonerated the victims and vindicated the families’ campaign for justice.The victims, whose reputations were muddied by the Army, Government and sections of the press as “nail bombers and gunmen”, were cleared by the Prime Minister’s admission that the killings were “unjustied and unjustiable”.However, when the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign was launched, families had three clear demands: to have the Widgery Report whitewash overturned and replaced by an independent inquiry to gain a formal acknowledgement of the innocence of all their loved ones, and to prosecute those responsible.The third objective has not been met.Families want prosecutions, but there is a feeling among some that the Saville Inquiry apportioned blame to rogue rank-and-file soldiers while the reputation of military chiefs who directed operations on the day remained untarnished.At Prime Minister’s Questions at Westminster yesterday, Boris Johnson said: “This Sunday marks a tragic day in our history and is one of the darkest days of the Troubles.”He echoed comments made by Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to “learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared, peaceful and prosperous future”.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the Army and the Parachute Regiment to issue a formal apology in the House of Commons yesterday.While he was raising the matter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson could be heard interjecting saying “shame” and “they were protecting the people of Northern Ireland from republicans”.Mr Eastwood said Parachute Regiment flags were flown on the outskirts of Derry and the regiment had rightly condemned the flying of them as a “grossly offensive act”.But, he said, they have yet to apologise and condemn the actions of their soldiers on Bloody Sunday.Mr Lewis said the Government has to accept responsibility for what happened in the past and work to find a way forward.Related topicsColum EastwoodSDLPBrandon LewisBoris JohnsonMore On Colum EastwoodSinn Fein to block Edwin Poots’ Executive paper over NI Protocol checks PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekBoris Johnson says Bloody Sunday ‘one of the darkest days’ ahead of Troubles anniversary PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionStruggling DUP will have to claw its way back to topDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsMost ReadMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo -

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA..................... OWENBEG..................... DROMARA made their second trip to Owenbeg and got their best result of the season.They came away with a well deserved draw, but will be thinking they should have had the overall win.On mat one Jim McNeill, Brian and Ann Marie OrsquoHare were playing E Milligan, Marc Crothers and Sean Toman.They shared the end wins and at the end nothing could separate them as it finished -.On the other mat Mark Brady, Niall and Michael McGreevy were involved in an equally close game against Isobel Rooney, Damian Tumelty and David Gibson.After nine ends found themselves three up.Davidrsquos triple tried their best on the last end but could only manage to score two shots to finish - down.With only a couple of shots in it at half-time it was all still to play for. Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS........... MARINA........................ MARINA made the trip to Loughinisland and went home with a good eight points that keeps them the best of the rest after the top two.It was the Saints who got off to the better start with Kevin Cassidy, Ann Marie McGreevy and John Gavin winning - against Norman Gordon, but sadly this would be as good as it would get for the home side.On mat two the visiting triple of Jimmy Graham, John Cummings and Ronan Smyth were involved in a high scoring game against Francie McGreevy with both sides having multiple counts, but it was Ronan who was getting the better of them to finish winners by -.After the break it was back to a low scoring affair between Sammy Hardy, Gerry Toman and Don Corrigan, who were playing Patricia Russell, Roy McKibben and Joey Chambers, who would win the last three ends for a - win.The final game saw Raymond Gelston along with Cecilia Magill and Manzi Cullen score two threes on the first two ends but would not score again until the seventh end against Isobel Cunningham, Henry McDowell and Billy Collom, who finished strongly to win -.All in all, a good nightrsquos bowls for the visitors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Control.jpg","title":"Take back control in your life  ","story":"SO here we are officially into . How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13405669.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some reviewers have claimed that Belfast lacks sufficient political context. The outbreak of violence in  is not properly explained in the film. Catholics and Protestants just seem to spontaneously start throwing things at each other. Surely Sir Kenny could have added a brief  to  minute prelude to the film outlining basic facts from Irish history starting with the Norman Invasion of . Or,he was pushed for time, maybe from the Plantation of Ulster in . He should at least have provided a comprehensive reading list with every cinema ticket sold. This would allow the film’s viewers across the globe to realise that the trouble in Belfast in  was actually caused by Oliver Cromwell, King Billy, the Pope, and Ian Paisley.Anyway, Kenny —you want to make Belfast , I am available.• My regular readers will be surprised to learn that it actually takes me quite a bit of time to write this column. It’s only around  words long but, dear reader, I can assure you that this is a hand crafted and bespoke newspaper column. Every single one of the words I compose is precious and sacred to me. Each comma and semi-colon is a friend. Every phrase is carefully considered, cogitated, and mulled over. I check and re-check the content. I always ask myself, is there a better way of expressing myself  Is a more pithy phrasing possible  Could the wording be wittier  Are my words open to misinterpretation  It’s only after being fully satisfied that I can stand over every syllable that I will let it be released to the public.If this was my policy, and indeed everyone’s policy when on Twitter, then the world would be a much better place.• Number  in lockdown was like the Holylands on St Patrick’s DayAt the time of writing the whole country is still locked in a bizarre updated version of Samuel Beckett’s classic play Waiting for Sue Gray .By the time you are reading this it will probably have been released so let me make an educated guess or two as to what Sue has found.Basically, during the strictest national lockdown in living memory, Number  was like a street in the Holylands on St Patrick’s Day. Sue will say that she changed her report from an investigation in to when parties took place at Downing Street to listing dates when they actually didn’t take place.There will be photographs of a COBRA meeting doing ‘Rock the Boat’.Sue will reveal that the cabinet were downing tequila shots to celebrate the arrival of Carrie Johnson’s new gold wallpaper.There will be video evidence of Boris holding an impromptu drinks party whilst on a visit to an ICU because it was Larry the Cat’s birthday. Sue will find that you can’t actually be ambushed by a cake.Sue will also allege that she was threatened by Tory Party whips and told thather report wasn’t favourable she’d be going back to running a pub in Newry. To be fair,we all just accept that Boris and his cabinet are permanently on the sauce it would actually help explain Brexit and a lot of other Tory Party policies. For instance, last week, in a desperate attempt to distract from Partygate ‘Culture Secretary’ Nadine Dorries attacked the BBC. I think she’s right. In fact all broadcasters should bow down to the Conservatives and only make television programmes that reflect true Tory Party values. Can I suggest a few suitable name changes of popular shows How about, Come Drink With Me  Strictly Come Boozing  The OneShow  Or a remake of the classic political sitcom Yesh Minishter  Anyway, it’s Wednesday morning and no-one can predict the immediate future. So I’m not saying that Boris is a dead man walking, but I wouldn’t be surprised , on Thursday, several Tory MPs dump him in a Post Office in Carlow.

It would be laughable,the issues facing rural Northern Ireland weren’t so real. Health, housing, jobs and fighting rural crime are just some of the priority issues the countryside want politicians to address, not pest control.It would be unwise, particularly for anyone seeking to represent the countryside, to pursue anti-rural policies which are, I believe, often based on hoods and misinformation.Gary McCartney, Director Countryside Alliance Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Mondays to Fridays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"mp lambasts colum eastwood over incendiary allegations ","story":"Russian spies are very active in NI says ex-Nato officer, after Russia reveals plans for naval excercise off Irish coast   VIDEO: John Traynor named as workman killed after dumper truck believed to have slid on rural hillNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsMP lambasts Colum Eastwood over ‘incendiary allegations’Former UK veterans’ minister Johnny Mercer has hit back at SDLP leader Colum Eastwood over a claim that troops were on a mission to murder on Bloody Sunday.By Mark RaineyWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Addressing the Commons on Wednesday, Foyle MP Mr Eastwood said troops “were sent to my city to murder” in  and that the Parachute Regiment has “yet to apologise”.Thirteen civil rights protesters were shot dead by soldiers on January , .Another man shot by paratroopers during the same incident died four months later, although his death was officially attributed to a brain tumour.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Kyrgios missed a set point when he tried a shot through the legs but two big s from the -year-old ultimately proved the dference.The wild cards looked on their way when they broke in the second game of the second set but Kyrgios lost his serve at -, smashing his racket in anger and becoming frustrated with fans calling out before his serve. vw,vw,px, px\"Nick Kyrgios, right, and Thanais Kokkinakis acknowledge the crowd It appeared the match might have turned but Kyrgios and Kokkinakis saved their best ing game for the right moment.When a final lob from Kokkinakis dropped in, the duo threw their rackets high into the air before jumping into each other’s arms..removeUnlike previous opponents, Granollers and Zeballos had no complaints about the crowd or the antics of Kyrgios, with the bigger environs of Rod Laver making it less of a bear pit.Kyrgios was angrily confronted by the fitness trainer of Mate Pavic after their third-round victory over the top seeds, while New Zealander Michael Venus labelled Kyrgios “an absolute knob” following the quarter-final.“I think tennis is a sport, as of now, that’s never been talked about as much,” said Kyrgios. “We need more attention, we need more viewers. My goal is to only bring new fans that may not be following tennis to watch tennis.“If they flick on a match and they have Thanasi and I playing in an entertaining doubles match, they know nothing about tennis,they watch that match just then, they probably would tune in next time. That’s what I’m about. That’s what I want to bring. I think that’s how the sport is going to survive.“As to Michael Venus, I’m not going to destroy him in this media conference room right now. But Zeballos and Granollers are singles players. They’ve had great careers. I respect them a lot more than I respect Michael Venus.“I think the balance was there today. The quality of tennis was amazing. I think the festival atmosphere was still there. I think they embraced it. They knew it was an incredible atmosphere.

It’s ridiculous.“It’s not like I’m going out there putting on a clown suit and creating a circus. I have also played, won titles, won big titles, I have played the traditional way. I think now I’m able to channel a dferent fan base.”The contrast with the other semi-final, being played simultaneously, could not have been more stark, with fewer than  people watching Salisbury and Ram’s match.The second seeds had expected more of an atmosphere and were hugely disappointed with their performance, especially after missing four set points in the second set.They were bidding to play in the final for a third consecutive year, and the disappointment was compounded by missing out on being part of Saturday’s show. vw,vw,px, px\"Thanasi Kokkinakis jumps into Nick Kyrgios’ arms “It would have been fun to play in it,” said Salisbury. “It would have been a great atmosphere and you don’t often get to play in front of that. I think it would have been tough but we’d obviously have liked to have that opportunity.”How the atmosphere is affected by having two Australian teams in the final remains to be seen, while it is also likely to be a dferent demographic to the largely young crowd who have followed the pair so far, but Kyrgios took exception to that line of questioning.“We have four Aussies in the final,” said Kyrgios. “Can we stop iding which crowd is going to go for who.

They also hosted live music with three musicians from Hong Kong over a weekend in November. “Music was one of the things that people said they wanted more of in Carrick on their Wildest Dreams postcards,” Lee explained.Sails and Tales successMeanwhile, the ongoing Sails and Tales exhibition explores  years of history through key events and stories relating to the maritime history of the town. From January to April , in the depths of lockdown, local people came together online to share their memories, interests, and photos, helping to shape their exhibition at the refurbished Kelly’s Coal Office. Built around , the building was constructed by local businessman Charles Legg, and the coal office and business was bought by John Kelly in . Marked with the iconic ‘K’, it has been known as Kelly’s ever since. Within a changing s economy, the business closed in the mid-s, and the building fell into disrepair, eventually being placed on the Buildings at Risk Register. “Thankfully, the current owner was able to secure funding from the Carrickfergus Townscape Heritage Initiativein  and the building has been brought back to le.
