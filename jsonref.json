Her two daughters, Susannah and Caitlin, who went to Oxford, and son Freddie, who was at Bath, all studied biochemistry. Now back at home, the 21-year-olds have been enrolled as guinea pigs in the vaccine trial.It was 1994 before Sarah reached Oxford, securing a post-doctoral position working on malaria, then vaccine development.She and her husband, fellow scientist Rob Blundell, faced a tough decision four years later when Prof Gilbert gave birth prematurely to the triplets. ‘Nursery fees would have cost more than my entire income as a post-doctoral scientist, so my partner has had to sacrifice his own career to look after our children,’ she says in her biography on Oxford’s Jenner Institute website.Now she is leading the search for a Covid-19 vaccine and clearly relishes the challenge. She gets up at 4am, cycles into work and doesn’t get home until 8pm.As she told The Daily Telegraph: ‘My husband has taken on all the shopping and cooking responsibilities. I just go home and sit down and there’s food there. I wouldn’t have the energy to cook anything myself.’Of the hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine, she added: ‘This is what I’ve been thinking about and planning for. It is really great to be implementing these things and have the funding, finally, to do it and move at the speed we know we can move.’Her brother Tom, 56, a country hotel manager, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Looking back, university was always likely for her and I’m sure she had the capability to go to Oxford or Cambridge from the start. It’s a shame she was never given the chance. But look at her now. She and her team are genuinely going to rescue all of us and the economy if this works.’His only regret is that their parents, who orced amicably after the children left home and who have both died in the past five years, were never able to witness the vital quest their daughter is now engaged upon.He said: ‘I know my parents were very proud when she graduated, and even more so when she became an Oxford professor.‘How much more now? Pride is what we all feel on her behalf.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35b4b1c15bb6802ca6e68ecdb276ccb745d937c9/0_0_1232_811/master/1232.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=84c86a8c7e9c00d22f66281aeb826926 2020w","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, the impact of Covid-19 around the world and the FA Cup semi-finals at an empty Wembley: the most striking photographs from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ecf6af4b53e398d1ada7276a96f6ddb2ff30fe/0_2_2485_1491/master/2485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ec7f06eeac9085deb4a261c35f9a7a","title":"playful origami using banknotes in pictures","story":"Yosuke Hasegawa has been making “money origami” for the past 14 years.

Land building activities or other forms of artificial transformation cannot change the classification of a feature under UNCLOS … the Australian government does not accept that artificially transformed features can ever acquire the status of an island.”Earlier on Saturday, Payne and Reynolds said “discussions at Ausmin 2020 will centre on our shared efforts towards a stable, resilient, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific, particularly in the context of the impact of Covid-19”.“Our relationship is built on our shared values, and a shared understanding of the importance of maintaining presence and leadership in our region.“In the face of an increasingly complex and contested regional environment, it is vital we continue working together across the breadth of our relationship.”The joint statement also reiterated that “the United States remains by far Australia’s largest source of foreign investment”.The ministers also wrote an opinion piece in Saturday’s the Australian newspaper noting “coercive actions in the South China Sea, such as the escalation of disputes and militarisation of disputed features, continue to create tensions that destabilises the region”.The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Australia needed to defend the “national interest” when asked about the change in position on Saturday morning.“We also need to stand up for international law,” he said. “And the international law of the sea provides for freedom of navigation which is absolutely critical to international trade.”Tensions between Australia and China escalated earlier this year as Canberra pushed for an inquiry into Beijing’s initial handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, with Australia’s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, complaining his Chinese counterpart would not answer his calls in May.Since then, China has issued a warning to its citizens, and lucrative international student market, not to travel to Australia out of fears of racism. In June, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused Australia of mass espionage and of “stoking confrontation”.Rising tensions have prompted Australian business leaders, who are worried further hostilities could damage exports to China, to call for a “separation of powers” between Australia’s foreign relations and trade ties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ba28603d7e9a02d85e59844e6586b9ccfff587/0_578_3589_2153/master/3589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1ff946511ff24e46121cd4f58976b3","title":"bryan washington my next book is a gay slacker dramedy","story":"The prize-winning young writer on the politics of restaurants, ersity in his home town of Houston, and why coming out is a constant processBryan Washington’s 2019 debut short story collection, Lot, was winner of the Dylan Thomas prize and listed as one of Barack Obama’s favourite books of the year. Set in impoverished Houston neighbourhoods, where gentrification threatens a collection of fierce and feisty characters – minimum-wage kitchen staff, drug dealers, sex workers – it is often darkly funny. At the book’s centre is Nicholas, the recurring narrator, who wrestles with his queerness and black-Latino identity. Washington, 27, has written for the New York Times, New Yorker and Paris Review. Lot is out in paperback on 6 August his first novel, Memorial, follows early next year in the UK.In Lot inidual chapters represent different marginalised regions of Houston, your home town…The city, for me, has no focal point. Houston is not inundated with “third” places you go to work and then you go home and then you have the sprawl in between. There are landmarks that I would acknowledge that could be immediately invalidated by my neighbours and none of us would be wrong. It’s largely due to the ersity of the city not just the ethnic ersity but also ersity of thought, economy and religion. Its residents have had to come together to find ways of functioning on a daily basis – not seamlessly, but what’s really cool about living here is the way that it’s understood you can live multiple lives simultaneously.The white characters, marginal in the neighbourhoods of Lot, are mostly thinly depicted. Often they’re just referred to as the “white boy”. Is that to counter the dominance of white characters in US fiction?Lot focuses on queer folk of colour. I’m fascinated by the way in which white authors will have a character of colour or a minority character or a double minority character and that character’s status as a marginalised entity is a default of their narrative. Many of my contemporaries are doing the work of de-centring whiteness from their narratives and from the centre point of American literary fiction at large.In Lot, while I don’t set out to condense a character’s entirety to who they are, I think that when you’re not centring whiteness, you find yourself with characters who will call a white boy a white boy because that’s who they are to that particular character. That’s not something I’ve seen on the page as often as I’d like.Your next book, Memorial, is a novel. How have you managed the transition from writing short stories to a novel?It’s difficult but I was fortunate to have friends who told me from the outset that the energy required would be different. Writing’s always hard but I’m most comfortable in the smaller moments between characters. I couldn’t have written Memorial without having written Lot and gaining an understanding from that.I pitched Memorial as a gay slacker dramedy. I’ve been calling it any number of pithy things like a “lower-case love story”, but each of those descriptions is an attempt to capture a tone which is deeply difficult for me to condense on to a page, this idea of bitter sweetness that volleys between moments of deep levity and moments of deep despair.What kind of reader were you as a child?I wasn’t a prodigious reader, but visiting Houston’s libraries opened my world up in ways that would have been unimaginable prior. I initially read Jacqueline Woodson, Tracy K Smith. And a significant amount of the fiction I read was literature in translation, whether that is work by Latinx authors, Asian authors or works across the diaspora.Which books are on your bedside table?Raven Leilani’s Luster, Brit Bennett’s The Vanishing Half and Samantha Irby’s essay collection, Wow, No Thank You.What is the best book you’ve read in recent years?Ocean Vuong’s On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous. He’s brilliant and so flexible with language and has such an understanding of what an emotion incarnate is, he is able to not only condense it but to heighten it across languages, across countries, across codes as characters speak to one another.

She quit City Hall six months after she arrived and left New Orleans. “By leaving,” she writes, “I reclaimed my voice.” With that voice and with her book, The Yellow House, which won the 2019 US National Book award, she tells a far less romantic tale about this great American city. A far more honest and daring one, too.Katrina claimed nearly 2,000 lives and ravaged many others, including that of Broom, whose childhood home, 4121 Wilson Avenue, was destroyed. The Yellow House makes plain the devastation, and the many causes, of that loss. Broom’s mother, Ivory Mae, had purchased the home in 1961 with money from her dead husband’s life insurance policy. (He’d been run over just outside a Texas military base. Ivory Mae, then pregnant with their third child, would remarry and give birth to six more children, including Sarah, the last.) When she and her children moved in, Ivory Mae was the first in her immediate family to own a home. 4121 Wilson Avenue represented the American dream made real. As Broom traces the house’s history from 1961 to, and beyond, its destruction, she also traces, or reveals, the emptiness of that dream, an emptiness that many millions across America have also realised in the years since.This is not, to be clear, literary disaster porn. The author has other plans: “to resurrect a house with words”. In so doing, she resurrects her city or, rather, presents it for the first time. Her New Orleans, New Orleans East, is not the New Orleans of your imagination, nor the imagination of cartographers (who often left the neighbourhood off city maps), nor even of historians, as “nothing had been written about the lives of the people who lived there.” New Orleans East is “a point beyond”. Broom takes us to the beyond, makes the beyond central.A sad and vital fact: the author could not see clearly until she was 10 years old. Life, until then, had been a blur. According to Ivory Mae, the first thing Sarah says after seeing through her new glasses is: “Trees have leaves.” This delayed sight gives the young girl an unusual hunger to catch every detail, a hunger that stays with her, to our great benefit. I was reminded of the title of Gore Vidal’s memoir Palimpsest, as in a parchment that has been written over and erased many times, yet still leaves traces of past layers. Broom is meticulous in illuminating those layers: there are maps, official records, photographs little histories of slave revolts, of French Quarter slave owners who were women of colour, of the Beatles’ first visit to town histories of local government achievements, such as Nasa’s Saturn V rocket, built at the plant where her father, then brother, were employed and histories of governmental failures, such as Hurricane Betsy, which hit in 1965. “The water had in fact swept in like a river,” she writes, “its course and fury made possible by many things, most of them manmade.” (One could write a similar sentence about many of the disasters, natural and otherwise, plaguing America today.) Most of all, we get an autopsic history of the Yellow House and the people who lived in it: birthdays, near-death accidents, light switches, curtains, possible sinkholes, persimmon trees, missing doorknobs, dress socks, etc, etc.I must confess: early on during some of this detail, I jotted in the margins: “I personally really do not care about all this.” Should you feel the same, please continue. You will find, later, advice the author received from a French Quarter neighbour whose stories went on a little too long for Broom’s liking. “Jesus Christ, darling,” he would say. “Will you find some patience?” It is clear that the author found enough to write this important book. It is clear, also, that she rightfully demands the same of us. The Yellow House is a work that refuses to capitulate to your impatience – not out of an arrogant self-indulgence, but out of care. She seems to say: You will not get your entertainment at my people’s expense. This strikes me as rare, even brave. Many writers, or at least this writer, feel alienated from their family. But here is a writer who appears fully enmeshed in a family, in a clan, a system of interdependence and responsibility. One of the remarkable traits of The Yellow House, which makes it something larger than a personal narrative, is that the story is not fashioned from Broom’s voice alone. Her mother’s words are interspersed seamlessly with hers. The chapter on Hurricane Katrina calls to mind the work of Svetlana Alexievich, who crafts indispensable narratives of Soviet and post-Soviet life from witness testimonies. “Who has the rights to the story of a place?” Broom asks late in The Yellow House. The book answers: all of us.That kind of communal intention, which flies in the face of the inidualism of our society, takes work. Takes, at the very least, presence. The Yellow House, then, is also the story of Broom’s journey to accepting such a task. As early as her teens she is itching to leave home. She heads to Texas for college, California for graduate school, spends time in Istanbul, Berlin and Hong Kong, makes a home in Harlem and even, for over a year, lives in Burundi, where she helps raise money for a nonprofit organisation and feels a piercing loneliness. While there, a local woman tries to convince Broom that she is also Burundian, that she has simply forgotten her language. “‘That is all,’ the translator told me. ‘You have been gone too long.’” The author’s story is ultimately one of return. She goes back to New Orleans to relearn the language of her city, of her people. To craft a record of this home, this neighbourhood, these lives about which so many have said, or felt: “The subject… was not historical in nature”, as was written in the record of the Yellow House’s demolition.Reading The Yellow House will not exactly resurrect 4121 Wilson Avenue. Nor will it repair what has been done to New Orleans and its inhabitants. It will, however, help you see a great many things more clearly. Since, as the author writes, “it’s hard to know what you cannot see”, this book will also help you know a great many things much better. More marvellous than that, these pages might inspire you to sit with your mother, your grandmothers – to ride out to the cemetery and check your dead friend’s plot – to gather with your siblings for an evening on the stone slab where once your childhood home stood. With The Yellow House, Sarah Broom has shown us a way to go back home, perhaps to heal. She has, I hope, fulfilled her “yearning for a leading role… in the story of New Orleans, which is to say, the story of America”.Casey Gerald’s memoir There Will Be No Miracles Here is published by Serpent’s Tail (£9.99)• The Yellow House by Sarah M Broom is published by Corsair (£16.99).

Are the couple wholly wronged and wonderful, no caveats permitted? Or is she an ambitious, wily, showbiz witch who hypnotised her prince into abandoning his family so that she could swan about the globe as a semi-royal, with all the privileges, but fewer tedious ribbon-snipping responsibilities? Perhaps most pressingly in this increasingly polarised issue, does the shabby treatment of Meghan in any way affect your view?Even for someone as staunchly Team Markle as myself, the new biography of the couple, Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand (with insights from friends of the couple, perhaps even secretly the couple themselves), looks a tad too simpatico. In the extracts I’ve seen, Meghan is depicted “tearfully” saying to a friend: “I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes”, which could be true, but it’s also a highly convenient pull-quote.Elsewhere, there’s the total cringe of the Sussex Royal online venture and more than a whiff of entitlement about the Sussexes’ negotiation of their break from the royals, which initially seems to amount to: “We’ll pop back occasionally, when it suits, but you can forget opening rainy fetes in Doncaster.” I’m not blind to such occasional inconsistencies, perhaps even hypocrisies. I just think other Meghan-related issues are more important.What is the main (vaguely legitimate) charge against Meghan anyway – that, all along, she fancied becoming a celebrity-philanthropist rather than a second-ision royal wife? Well, so what if it is true – is it a hanging offence? Then there’s the more serious charge: that Meghan, being mixed-race, took on the mantle of victimhood to garner support. Well, this is tricky, because, while I wouldn’t accuse the vast majority of Britons of being racist, many of us detected elements of racism in Meghan’s news coverage.Everything else aside, it seems to me that sectors of the press had a choice to behave absolutely impeccably on the racial front and they (not Meghan) chose not to. One particular news item, relating to her childhood, was, in my opinion, coded racism at its worst, probably not something that would even be attempted in these post-George Floyd times. It was so sly and horrible that it made me cry.This is what matters to me. It’s why I don’t care if the Sussexes are occasionally naive, compromised or entitled or if they end up flogging royal wedding tea towels on Sussex Royal. What matters is that Meghan hasn’t “played the victim”, she is a victim, or, more accurately, a survivor. Whatever some people say, at certain points, the racism was real. And, if that had been me and my mixed-race baby, I’d have wanted to leave the country too.Gyms are reopening (the ones that can) and good luck to them. I am, however, mystified by people saying they’re unsure if they wish to return. The sense of no longer feeling drawn to gym culture: the people, the atmosphere, the life-altering spin classes... Maybe this says more about you than it does about gyms.People have got into the habit of demanding that their choice of gym or workout reflects them. An “identity” factor has come into play whereby the gym that someone attended, their type of exercise, in which brand of stretchy clobber, said as much, if not more, about them and their chosen tribe than about any desire to do the only thing that makes sense at any gym: maintain fitness.This is clever marketing: gyms presenting as microcosms of you and your mindset. Just as obviously, it’s absurd. Looking back to school - PE was just PE. There was no spin on it, no promise – for the talentless majority – of fun, increased social standing or a sense of belonging. Fitness was the sole aim. Put on your shorts and get on with it.Now here we are again. Lockdown appears to have opened people’s eyes to the fact that gyms are all about fitness and the rather tedious effort it takes to achieve it. The rest of the breathless promises (you will be beautifulpopularfashionable. You will belong) are exposed as promotional bells and whistles. Which is fine. Lockdown may have broken the spell of customer-expectation, but gyms still offer machines, classes and everything else to facilitate fitness. If your gym is now open, what more do you think you need?Are you a born wuss? The kind of person who truly believes that injections hurt them more? That you’re “just more sensitive to pain than other people”? If so, then prepare to embrace your inner Neanderthal.Contrary to the popular belief that Neanderthals were knuckle-dragging, hairy thugs, a study published in Current Biology reports that they could be responsible for some of us being over-sensitive cry-babies. When Neanderthals bred with humans all those years ago, a group of their descendants ended up with a mutation, leading to extra-sensitive nerve endings and a lower pain threshold.Other Neanderthal inheritances include a heightened resilience to the cold, but this pain threshold element is intriguing. Previously, I’d have thought that people claiming something “hurt them more” were – what’s the technical term again? – lying. Now it seems that there might be a solid evolutionary reason for their suffering.Not that many people seem to have been affected, certainly not as many as are now probably reading this and thinking: “Oh my God, that’s me, with the Neanderthal low pain threshold genetic mutation thingie… It explains so much. I’m even braver than I thought I was.” While this research could alter the perception of Neanderthals, the smart money is on human nature remaining stubbornly unchanged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0ebbc27f11e4b0605de0262ad3f0d9bb35c88c/0_103_3155_1892/master/3155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d3508b99c2132172276db99724586d","title":"the term bame isnt fit for use we need a new political language","story":"We can’t analyse society without categorising people. But we need precision in the categories used“I hate being described” as one, tweeted Channel 4’s Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Sunder Katwala, founder of the thinktank British Future, doesn’t identify as one. And last week Coventry’s Belgrade theatre promised never to use the description again.What they are all talking about is “BAME”, that soulless acronym to describe black, Asian and minority ethnic people that is creeping into fashion in policy circles and journalism. It has been around for a while, but the Covid-19 pandemic and the discussions around Black Lives Matter protests have given the term a higher visibility. The majority of people, though, have no idea what it means. And most people who might be described as BAME loathe the term.The problem is not simply that BAME is a clunky description. The debate also points to deeper questions about how people are categorised and what such categories tell us.It’s impossible to analyse society or the impact of social policies without distinguishing between categories of people. In France, the nation’s universalist ethos means that ethnic and religious data is rarely collected. The resolve to treat everyone as citizens, not as bearers of specific racial or cultural histories, is valuable. In practice, though, many people are denied equal treatment and racism is deep seated, but the lack of data makes it difficult to gauge discriminatory practices.In Britain, there has been much debate about the unequal impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities. Not so in France, largely because there’s little information in which to root a debate. But if lack of statistics is a problem, possessing data is no panacea. Decisions on what data to collect and how to interpret it may themselves mislead.Take the question of street violence. Twenty years ago, the major issue of concern was not knife crime but street robbery. Then, as now, black people were over-represented in the statistics, leading to the claim that there is something about black culture leading to criminality.The criminologists Marian FitzGerald, Jan Stockdale and Chris Hale analysed the data. They showed that street crime was much more likely in areas with a high population turnover and a combination of young people living in poverty alongside others who were both more affluent and trendy enough to own gadgets such as mobile phones. Young black people lived disproportionately in such areas. But where such areas included large numbers of poor white people, they, too, were involved in robberies.The category “lives in an area of high population turnover with a mixture of poor people and affluent trendies” is not politically salient. “Black” is. So street robbery became associated with black people. The result is what FitzGerald calls “statistical racism”.People belong to many categories and categories overlap. African Caribbeans and Bangladeshis in Britain, for instance, are disproportionately working class, compared not just with white people but with other minority groups, such as Indians, Chinese and black Africans. But while discussion of the white population routinely takes class into account, discussions of minorities rarely do.Consider school exclusions. Black pupils are disproportionately excluded from school. Look more closely and you see the problem is in particular with those of Caribbean descent. Pupils of black African descent are less likely to be excluded than their white peers.School exclusion, then, is a major issue facing white working-class pupils, too, and class as well as race may play a role in the disproportionate exclusion of black pupils. But to say so is to invite the accusation that one is downplaying the significance of racism. And so, more nuanced accounts of discrimination are often ignored.When I was growing up, I saw myself, and was seen as, “black”. In the 1980s, it was a political term, denoting a sense of a common struggle against racism. Over time, as identities have become less political, more ethnic or cultural, so the meaning of “black” has changed.Some see BAME as a means of articulating that feeling of commonality that “black” once denoted. It’s not. It’s an administrative, not a political, term.

Her story shocked the country – as someone who had moved to Britain from Jamaica aged 10, she had lived and worked legally here for decades. Despite that, she had her benefits withdrawn and was wrongfully arrested, detained at Yarl’s Wood and almost deported to a country she had not lived in for 50 years. Her story paved the way for others to come forward with equally dreadful accounts. Wilson has since campaigned tirelessly for justice just last month, she and other campaigners presented a petition with more than 130,000 signatures to Downing Street calling for the full implementation of the independent Windrush review.What happened to the Windrush generation is an indelible and ugly stain on this country one of the most dreadful examples of the institutional racism we like to think of as long banished but that still lingers everywhere from police stop and search, to the over-representation of black young people in young offender institutions, to the high unemployment rates among young black men. As a direct result of Theresa May’s hostile environment policy, members of the Windrush generation, who had been actively encouraged to come to the UK from the Caribbean Commonwealth to take up public service jobs, including in the NHS, have wrongfully lost jobs they had had for decades, been denied NHS treatment for life-threatening conditions and been detained then deported to countries they had not visited for decades.It is in no small part down to Wilson’s campaigning, along with the ’s reporting, that the government has started to shift its approach. For years, ministers have dragged their feet: May refused initially to even meet the Windrush victims. The architects of the hostile environment, including May’s former adviser Nick Timothy, still maintain that the approach is entirely justified that, despite all the warnings ministers simply ignored, it was just unfortunate that people living in Britain legally were caught up in an absurdly disproportionate policy that required people without a passport to provide four pieces of documentary evidence for each year they had been resident in the UK. Three full months after Wendy Williams’s independent Windrush review rubbished this claim – and just a few days after Wilson delivered her petition to Downing Street – the home secretary, Priti Patel, finally committed to implementing all 30 of its recommendations, including a full review of the hostile environment.Williams’s review is clear that it was the responsibility of ministers and senior civil servants to understand the history of Commonwealth immigrants – the fact that their legal status had been granted under a document-light system – and that they would inevitably get caught up in the tentacles of the hostile environment. And the terrible injustices faced by this generation of migrants are far from over. There have been huge delays in administering the compensation fund – just 60 people received £360,000 between them in compensation out of an expected fund of up to £5m in its first year, perhaps little wonder given the claims form is 18 pages long, with 44 pages of accompanying guidance. The Williams review concluded that there are members of the Windrush generation who remain vulnerable to the hostile environment and that, while the government has admitted that more than 160 people from the Caribbean Commonwealth were wrongfully detained and deported, it has never investigated the numbers affected from other parts of the Commonwealth. That we do not know the true scale of the injustice years after these stories first came to light is appalling.It is not enough for Patel to commit to a review of the hostile environment, which the government has since tried to rebrand as the “compliant environment”: it must be dismantled immediately. As well as subjecting people living legally in the UK to the most terrible injustices, it has three further disastrous impacts. First, the policy has not achieved its stated aims of encouraging people in the UK illegally to leave voluntarily instead, it drives them underground into exploitative situations in the labour market and – in the case of migrant women – in the home.Second, by forcing ordinary citizens such as doctors, landlords and bank clerks to perform immigration checks on their neighbours on pain of being fined, it creates institutionalised discrimination for example, the government’s right to rent policy, ruled racially discriminatory by the high court, means that landlords are less likely to rent to people with “foreign accents or names”. (The court of appeal later overturned the ruling while conceding that the policy resulted in discrimination.)Last, the extortionate fees and Kafkaesque bureaucracy involved in immigration applications – it can cost a young person who has grown up in the UK tens of thousands of pounds in fees and years of applications to secure permanent status when they turn 18– are creating a whole new generation who through no fault of their own are falling foul of the hostile environment as adults, despite having lived here since they were young children.The hostile environment is the direct consequence of a government that views migrants not as people who have much to contribute to the fabric and culture of the UK, but dehumanises them as convenient fodder for prejudice as numbers that get in the way of unachievable and arbitrary immigration targets. Even as Boris Johnson launches yet another racism review, his government continues to pursue policies that are racially discriminatory. The only way to honour Paulette Wilson’s legacy is to immediately scrap the hostile environment and for us all to embark on a period of self-reflection as to how and why the terrible injustices inflicted on the Windrush generation were ever allowed to happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

It is an age when Match of the Day provides the xG and yet a manager can come under pressure after three defeats. It is the age when most people understand the phrase “regression to the mean”, yet it is also an age when mayflies have begun using “Watford head coach” to denote something with a short life. There is something deeply paradoxical about the present era of football.Which brings us to Brendan Rodgers. Leicester will qualify for the Champions League for the second time if they beat Manchester United on Sunday or if they draw and Chelsea lose to Wolves. If they do miss out there would be understandable disappointment given they were eight points clear of fifth when the Premier League was suspended.Their recent form has been dismal: two wins in eight games since the restart. But it is not as simple as them having been disrupted by the break and struggling to rediscover their rhythm: the downturn had already begun.Although they beat Aston Villa 4-0 in the last game before lockdown, they had won one in seven before that. Since Rodgers signed a new five-year contract at the beginning of December, Leicester have taken 27 points from 22 league games, while losing to Aston Villa in the EFL Cup semi-finals and Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-finals. This season is founded on a run of 14 matches between late August and December when Leicester won 12, losing only to Liverpool and Manchester United.Which, then, is the true Leicester, the side that sliced apart mid‑table opponents, putting nine past Southampton and five past Newcastle, and was good enough to stand toe-to-toe with Arsenal and Tottenham in that run or the insipid side that barely mustered a chance against Norwich and Brighton, or even the self-destructive shambles who contrived to lose 4-1 at Bournemouth?In the fable, six blind men approach an elephant one by one. The first insists it is like a wall, the next like a spear, then a snake, a tree, a fan and a rope. Though each was partly in the right, all were in the wrong. And so it is with Leicester. You can take inidual parts of this season and make almost any case you like about the level of the club, but they all comprise the true Leicester, the good and the bad.Leaving aside the tendency highlighted by Pep Guardiola’s new assistant, Juanma Lillo, to venerate what ends well rather than what has been done well, and looking at the season as a whole, it is hard to regard it as anything other than a success. Leicester have the eighth-highest wage bill in the Premier League at worst they will finish three places above that. Only Sheffield United, Wolves and Burnley are likely to outperform their wage bill by more.But Leicester’s achievement is greater even than that. While it is true Arsenal and Tottenham have had unusually poor campaigns, and Chelsea and United have had their problems – this will be the first time since 2006-07 that the team finishing third has not reached 70 points – it is also true that for two decades breaking into the elite bubble, whether the Big Four or the more recent Big Six, has seemed an insurmountable leap.The question then becomes a matter of focus. Does it matter that Leicester accrued most of their points in the first half of the season, when their actual goals-per-game output outstripped their xG by 2.2 to 1.7? The answer to that really depends on whether you regard the collapse in form since Christmas as a trend that is likely to be continued. There is, though, an obvious explanation for it beyond simple regression to the mean, although that clearly played its part, and that is injuries.Leicester have been without Ricardo Pereira since March and lost Ben Chilwell in the win over Crystal Palace at the beginning of this month. Because of his hip injury, James Maddison was able to play only a half in the final seven league games of the season. Wilfred Ndidi has not been back to his best since missing five games with a knee problem in January. Those are four key positions for Leicester: the full-backs give them attacking thrust and create space for the wide forwards Maddison is their main source of creativity and Ndidi’s energy and reading of the game are essential to Rodgers’s favoured 4-1‑4-1.There is also an issue of opponents adapting. Leicester are at their best winning the ball high up the pitch or breaking rapidly so Jamie Vardy has space to run into. Opponents – notably Brighton and Watford – have begun to sit deep and allow them the ball. That, to a large extent, negates Vardy, and they have begun to do it just as Leicester’s other creative options have become unavailable.It is possible Rodgers has lost the dressing room. It is possible there has been a catastrophic loss of faith in his methods. It is possible those methods were at best incidental to a freakish run of form through the autumn. It may be that the trend continues downwards. But it seems far more likely that a pair of defeats at Christmas, away at City and then at home to Liverpool in what was probably the champions’ best performance of the season, shook confidence and that it has been impossible to regain the earlier form as a relatively slim squad has been exposed by injury.Leicester will finish at least four places higher than last season and with at least 10 more points. They have broken into the Big Six – or at least have been there as the Big Six have collapsed around them – and have reached cup quarter and semi‑finals. And they have qualified for Europe. They may end up missing out on the Champions League, but a year ago this outcome would have seemed a triumph for Rodgers. A point in the autumn is worth no less than a point in the spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

The demands are multiple – it needs to be practical (bikes, bins if you live in the city), but also provide privacy and visual interest. The first impression of a house often wins the buyer if you are selling and lifts your spirits if not, so make yours enticing. Here’s the expert view on how to spruce up every entrance.“Your front entrance is a little portal into your space,” says east London interior designer Rachel Chudley. “From the moment you walk into the garden you want to give off little signifiers that you have entered somewhere special.” Known for her boldly off-beat decorative style, Chudley has recently created a grand powder-coated black metal gate for the entrance of her own home and studio, whose intricate design is part art nouveau and part intergalactic DNA. It’s all about the details. Add your own wrought-iron gate, with a series of high planters and mirrors on walls around the front door to create that sense of an otherworldly entrance. If an alternate access route is possible – on a corner property with a garden wall, for instance, consider ditching the front door and turning a side gate into your own Secret Garden-style ingress.The quickest route to smartening an entrance is to tidy up the paintwork – doors, architraves and windowsills should be immaculate. When it comes to colour, be age-appropriate and stick to historic tones for period properties. Little Greene ’s Ruth Mottershead recommends taking the tone of the brickwork or render as a starting point: neutral tones such as “Hammock” or “Bath Stone” suit stone-based hues darker tones such as “Dock Blue” or “Basalt” feel smart, while pastels, including “Dorchester Pink – Mid”, lend a more rustic look. Still stuck? “Think about the shades you already have in the hallway and work from there,” suggests Mottershead.Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa called door handles “the handshake of the building”. For the interior and product designer Martin Brudnizki, door furniture is an opportunity to be playful. “Door handles and letterboxes are a place to experiment,” says Brudnizki, whose own country house features an escutcheon plate embellished with a beehive motif. “Why not add a hand or a lion?” he suggests. Try Broughtons, Jim Lawrence and antiques stores for inspiration. Pick a theme, then be consistent. For instance, match a buttery yellow door with a bumblebee knocker.Adding colour and pattern in a porch, or on front steps, lends instant zing. Depending on your budget, opt for encaustic or Zellige tiles from Emery Et Cie or Artisans of Devizes. Or, for a cheaper option, Rachel Chudley suggests experimenting with paint finishes to create a tile-effect using gloss and matt paints inside a porch wall. “You can totally transform even the tiniest entrance space with colour, pattern and sheen,” she says. “Don’t be afraid of using dark tones in small spaces. It brings depth and light, and contrasts beautifully with foliage.”“There’s so much to spend money on other than bin storage,” says interior designer Rita Konig, who runs an online decorating course. “But if you buy something simple – such as pitch-roofed timber storage from Wickes – and paint it a dark, glossy green it just disappears.” Trellis can create an aesthetically pleasing structure around bins or bikes, especially when covered in jasmine or ivy. It may sound obvious, says Konig, but simply keeping bins clean stops them feeling so grotty. Make this easier by positioning them on slab rather than gravel, preferably close to the outside tap.“Things need to be low maintenance in a front garden, especially if it’s a communal space,” says Rita Konig. She suggests adding ox-eye daisies and hydrangeas in the biggest terracotta pots you can afford, and – despite the threat of blight – she also loves a bit of box hedging for privacy from passers-by in a front garden. Invest in a simple irrigation system – Hozelock is a good source – that attaches to an outdoor tap on a timer, so that it looks after itself. When space is limited line the windowsill with little pots of pink geraniums and pelargonium that, unlike bulky window boxes, can be shifted around. These will enhance the aesthetic experience of your garden from inside and out.“If you have a front garden use it,” says Martin Brudnizki. “Even those in the city should treat their front patch like a cottage garden. Add a few flagstones with gaps in between and let thyme and wildflowers grow around them.” If entrance space is nonexistent, encourage wisteria, Rambling Rector, Himalayan Musk or Gertrude Jekyl roses in pale pinks and whites to grow on the facade.There’s nothing like statuary to make a statement. “You don’t need huge statues to make a big impression,” says Rachel Chudley. “Even small elements create areas of interest.” We’re not talking gnomes here, think classical Greek and Roman. Try reclamation sites, such as Lassco, which has just introduced a collection of plaster casts of flowerheads and other roundels and reliefs made in Oxfordshire stone. For something grander, go for a classical bust, or stone ball finials either side of a walled gate or steps.

Live-streamed globally last Thursday, Idiot Prayer: Nick Cave Alone at Alexandra Palace, a film of that performance, is the most elaborately creative response yet to the constrictions of the lockdown.In April, the onset of the pandemic cost Cave and the Bad Seeds the European and American legs of their world tour, which was rumoured to have been a spectacular production that would include a full gospel choir. Compared to, say, Laura Marling’s recent show on the stage of an empty Union Chapel in London, Cave’s solo performance was an extravagantly grand event that called on the services of the renowned Irish cinematographer Robbie Ryan (The Favourite, Marriage Story, American Honey), a full film crew and an extensive production team. His wife, Susie, was creative director.The film begins with a self-consciously theatrical flourish: a shot of the singer sitting in a chair writing in a notebook, looking immaculately stylish as always in, as the end credits reveal, a tailormade Gucci suit. The camera then trails Cave as, silhouetted in half-light, he makes his way down a wide staircase and through several other ornately decorated rooms towards the performance space. On the accompanying soundtrack he recites an amended version of Spinning Song, a quasi-allegorical track from his most recent album, Ghosteen.After that, for the next hour and 30 minutes, it’s all about the songs and Cave’s commanding presence, by turns dramatic and quietly transfixing. The setlist leans heavily on The Boatman’s Call, his most contemplative album, but there are also several surprises. A haunting Sad Waters from 1986’s Your Funeral, My Trial, sounded almost elegiac in this starker setting. Then, a quietly reverent Brompton Oratory gives way to the extravagant lyricism of Grinderman’s Palaces of Montezuma, one of several dramatic juxtapositions that highlight the range of Cave’s extensive back catalogue.As we know from past outings, Cave’s ballads, whether a lovelorn cri de coeur such as Far From Me or a feverish death song such as The Mercy Seat, tend to work equally well in a solo piano setting. Both songs feature here, the former even more regretful than the original, the latter restrained and haunting until it builds slowly into something more chilling.More intriguing, though, are his deft readings of more recent songs from the album trilogy of Push the Sky Away, Skeleton Tree and Ghosteen, many of which forgo the traditional narrative form for an almost stream-of-consciousness lyricism tied to often dissonant sonic settings. Girl in Amber, stripped of the electronically treated voices, becomes a very different song, Cave’s emphatic delivery imbuing it with an even more visceral sense of grief and isolation. Euthanasia, a track that did not make it on to Skeleton Tree, debuted here, summons up the spirit of the young Van Morrison in its incantatory vocal repetitions.As the performance unfolds, you sense Cave settling into the songs, inhabiting them entirely as if immersed in his own private space. Jubilee Street, while not possessing the spiralling momentum of the band version, is nevertheless dramatic, Cave pounding on the keys as if willing it towards its dizzying conclusion. Likewise, a pared-to-the-bone Higgs Boson Blues retains its surreal, disorienting momentum against all the odds.Things shift gear towards the end, first with a dramatic Papa Won’t Leave You, Henry, a slice of southern gothic that will please those longtime fans who - to paraphrase Cave’s friend Shane MacGowan – wish he would head back into the swamp more often. The performance ends quietly with a tenderly stoical Black Hair and a sparse, elegiac Galleon Ship, which, without the otherworldly electronic atmospherics of the Ghosteen version, sound even more affecting.Throughout, Nick Cave speaks not a word, which only adds to the sombre, slightly unreal atmosphere. Only a wry smile and a quick laugh at the end of (Are You) the One That I’ve Been Waiting For? fractures the prevailing mood of quiet intensity. Though deftly edited, the film is a record of a single, uninterrupted performance. “You will not be able to pause, rewind or fast-forward the stream,” the website warns, as if acknowledging the strange hinterland this kind of meticulously staged digital event occupies.The illusion of total intimacy is broken only once when, during Higgs Boson Blues, an aerial shot reveals the presence of the camera crew quietly at work in the foreground. It’s a neat acknowledgment of the many ironies that attend this kind of event, not least the fact that the presence of the film crew affords us the kind of intimacy that a live gig, however small, could never convey. Conversely, those between-song silences are a reminder that, without an audience, something crucial is lost: that sense of being there in a room with the performer those taut moments of rapt stillness that give way to noisy appreciation.Ultimately, for all the elaborate staging and the high-end production, it is Cave’s commanding presence as a performer that compels. Throughout, his extraordinarily expressive face is a measure of his immersion in these old and new songs. At the end, he stands up and walks off into the light. One hopes that the crew burst into spontaneous applause.

Now Dettori has seven wins in the Ascot showpiece too, thanks to a brilliant and brutally efficient success by Enable here on Saturday, which set a record of her own as the first horse to win the King George three times.There was much talk of tactics before the three runners set off but no amount of scheming would have been able to contain Enable, the 4-9 favourite despite ­having been beaten on her past two starts.Sovereign, as expected, set a strong pace, with Japan settled just behind Enable by Ryan Moore, but by the time Enable moved smoothly alongside Sovereign two furlong out, Japan was already struggling.At this point, Dettori took a long look around and liked what he saw. “I didn’t hear a lot,” he said, “so I thought he was either sneaking behind me or I’d got a bit of daylight, and the second thing I thought was: he’s in trouble. All she had to do was find another gear and she did.”It was enough to take Enable five and a half lengths clear of Sovereign at the line and give horse and rider their 11th Group One success together, six more than Dettori has registered on any other horse in his long career.Their association has been, for the most part, an unbroken run of success, with just one crushing disappointment when Waldgeist denied them an unprecedented third Arc at Longchamp last October.There were fears that Enable’s enthusiasm might be on the wane when she was beaten for the second race running in the Eclipse this month, but those doubts now seem very premature.“She’s been in Newmarket for four years going up those gallops and she knows what’s going on,” Dettori said. “We tried a variety of things to get the fire back, and that’s why John Gosden is a great trainer, he does things outside the box, and we got her back.“She’s not getting better, but her enthusiasm throughout the race today was plain to see and she’s thriving with racing. The dream is the third Arc. We came so close last year and with this kind of performance, you think, we’re still in with a shot.”No rider misses the racecourse crowds as keenly as Dettori and he knows that a few thousand fans, at least, should be at Longchamp in October for what seems likely to be Enable’s final start. First, though, she may head to York next month for either the Yorkshire Oaks or the International Stakes, and a possible first meeting with Love, this year’s brilliant Oaks winner.Love was the clear favourite for the Arc before the King George but Enable has now joined her at the top of the ­betting as 3-1 joint-favourite with Paddy Power.“I love her so much,” Dettori said. “I’ve become friends with her, she’s got tremendous presence and she knows she’s good. I know I’ll only have her for another couple of months and I’m trying to enjoy it, like everyone else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5abba159594cb1990a0e0558b1ca4d6e286d3f10/0_18_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5344b764e7b0a5e4e4181956f0505088","title":"sliding home baseball in colour in pictures","story":"As the 2020 season finally gets under way, we take a look back in time, courtesy of the work of artist Mark Truelove and his fantastic colorised vintage baseball photographs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5bdf215b484956beedc5e1df85057463972edf8/0_883_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d581e26d382aefd0105bba01b74cb7f","title":"luckiest people in the world month on last lockdown cruise","story":"On 1 March, photographer Jon Tonks left New Zealand on a Pacific cruise. Twenty eight days later, the boat docked in San Diego, amid a pandemic. What happened in between?The cruise ship MS Maasdam left New Zealand on the evening of 1 March, steaming out of Auckland’s Waitemata harbour into the Hauraki Gulf, where it headed north. The route was to San Diego via Fiji, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Hawaii. On board the Holland America Line ship were around 1,200 passengers, including Americans, Britons, Canadians, Australians and French holidaymakers. The 542 crew included Dutch, Americans, Germans, Venezuelans and Filipinos. There were also a handful of entertainers and guest lecturers along for the ride, including Jon Tonks, a portrait photographer from Bath, who ended up with a portrait of a cruise that didn’t go to plan.Covid-19 was certainly a thing at the beginning of March, but it was still considered mainly a China thing. The Maasdam wouldn’t be going anywhere near China. Questionnaires were handed to passengers, about symptoms and where they’d been before, but then they were good to go. Still, Tonks says that friends had joked before he left: “Good luck on your corona cruise.”In some ways it did turn into a corona cruise, in that the virus was the major factor in what played out over the next month. No one on board got infected this is not a story of passengers being locked in their cabins and the ship’s morgue overflowing with corpses. But it will be some time before people gather en masse on a floating resort again.To begin with, everything went to plan. “We had a full entertainment team, and the schedule all worked out for this beautiful journey,” says cruise director Thomas Weber, speaking on the phone from Palm Springs, California. Weber, 50, had by then been working for seven months straight, and had had to be begged to do this one. “Little did I know it was going to be the most challenging contract I had taken so far.”Among that entertainment team was Adam Langstaff, 34, a drummer from Birmingham with onboard covers band the Runaround Kids, who mostly do 1950s and 60s rock’n’roll to cater for the tastes of the passengers, most of them in their 70s and 80s. Was there any dancing? “We always tried, but it was normally an uphill struggle – nobody has the guts to be the first,” he says. But Langstaff was having a nice time in the South Pacific, enjoying the food, the friendly atmosphere and an undemanding workload.There were lectures about the natural world, and Tonks gave his first photography talk, which went well. To his surprise, his former religious studies teacher was in the crowd. Terri Shanks, 49, from Worthing, was travelling with her 12-year-old son Cameron, whom she had taken out of school to “world-school”. Her grown-up daughter kept them up to date with life at home, sending pictures of supermarkets stripped bare and people fighting over loo roll. “It was surreal. We stepped on in Auckland, in a normal world, and 28 days later stepped off in San Diego, into this global apocalypse. The whole world had changed in those four weeks.”Hygiene rules got stricter as the cruise progressed, with more frequent and visible cleaning. Crew members started standing by the hand sanitiser stations, to make sure passengers used them.But it was becoming harder for him to go on stage to introduce a comedy show, when the audience had just been told that their next stop had been cancelled and that they faced several days at sea. Weber found that getting up there with a martini in his hand helped lighten the mood. The passenger questions in the regular Q\u0026ampA sessions with the captain were suddenly all along the lines of: is there coronavirus aboard? And: where the hell are we getting off this ship?Most passengers were understanding, with a small minority up in arms. Tonks remembers a group of young Americans, who had been looking forward to a ing excursion somewhere. “They sat at the bar, smashing margaritas all day, getting progressively more drunk and irate. I remember one of them saying, ‘You’re using a pandemic as an excuse!’”Then Rarotonga in the Cook Islands let the Maasdam in. Passengers could take one of the tenders ashore for a day’s sightseeing, before returning to the ship. Next stop: Tahiti, where several passengers and entertainers, including Tonks and the Runaround Kids, were due to disembark. But there was bad news that evening: Tahiti wouldn’t have them, either. The Maasdam sailed on into a fog of uncertainty.Tonks tells me he thinks people go on cruises to see the world, but also to be institutionalised. “When that comfort blanket was removed, they didn’t know what to do.” He was with a group at the bar, staring into their phones, trying to work out which way they were heading: was it west, back to New Zealand? Or east, to America? “It took a while to realise we were going round in circles.” The captain was figuring out what to do, as well as trying to negotiate with ports to allow them entry. In the end, the Maasdam returned to anchor off Rarotonga, for further uncertainty, and for passengers to do more staring into their phones, trying to find out what was going on – here, at home, in the world.For Dave Morin, 79, on the cruise of a lifetime with his wife Vicki, the main worry was the family wedding venue business back home in Massachusetts. “I was getting a lot of panicky phone calls: brides concerned about what was going to happen with their weddings.” He didn’t mind about extending the cruise. “I can think of a lot worse places to be held hostage. While we were on the ship, we had three good meals a day and got to play bingo, and see shows at night and sunbathe on the back deck.”Other passengers were worried about their medication running out. But they were only allowed to disembark at Rarotonga if they could get an air ticket out, so there was a rush – on the boat’s sketchy wifi – to buy flights. Tonks managed to get one back to Auckland, from where he’d get another to London. He was on the last tender ashore before the ship departed again, this time for Hawaii, 2,800 miles away.He remembers watching from the shore until the Maasdam was a dot on the horizon, with mixed emotions. “Part of me thinks I should have stayed. I went from being on a cruise ship which was incredibly sociable, had four bars and a load of people who were a good laugh, to isolating by myself in Bath. Also it would have been amazing to carry on shooting photographs.”Meanwhile, the camaraderie on board became more intense. The irate Americans had gone, and there were 350 fewer passengers, as well as less in the way of entertainment. “Suddenly we had to work for a living,” laughs Langstaff, who along with the Runaround Kids got roped into game shows and talent contests. He didn’t mind he didn’t have anywhere else he needed to be. “All our other work was out the window anyway.”Weber hosted a big coffee morning in the main theatre, and asked passengers who could do what, and who wanted to get involved. “Someone said, ‘I can teach Spanish’, or ‘I can teach ballroom dancing’,” remembers Shanks, who offered to do a storytelling session. “After the initial frustration about the cruise not turning out as expected, people just said: let’s get on and enjoy it. It was actually really lovely – we became one big happy family. Cameron was the only child on the ship for those last two weeks: suddenly he had all these adopted grannies and grandads making a big fuss of him, which he absolutely loved.”One night an amateur astronomer held a stargazing session on the top deck. “The captain turned off all the lights on the ship, so there was this immense blackness around us,” says Huguette Khan, 76, from Ontario, on board with her husband, Sherry. “That will stay in my mind for a long time.”After Rarotonga, everyone had been on the ship for more than two weeks no one had joined, no one had got sick – so they knew they were pretty much self-quarantined. “Every time a port didn’t let us in, I pointed out we were some of the luckiest people in the world in our little bubble,” Weber says. St Patrick’s Day, cancelled around the world, was a big one on the Maasdam. Another night, the Runaround Kids abandoned Buddy Holly and came out dressed as schoolgirls when they did Britney Spears’ … Baby One More Time, with Langstaff on vocals, the crowd went wild.Then another big blow: Hawaii wouldn’t take them. The governor changed his mind at the last minute, and wouldn’t let anyone – not even US citizens – ashore. After taking on supplies, the Maasdam set off again, for San Diego. Weber, who’d mustered all his energy in keeping the ship on an even keel, emotionally speaking, until they got to Hawaii, faced another week at sea.“Good morning, refugees,” he began his announcement the following morning, before alerting passengers to a change in the entertainment schedule due to a new health scare. “We have postponed the Hawaiian shirt contest because the Center for Disease Control has announced that Hawaiian shirts can cause paranoia and a weakening of the spine…”That night, instead of the martini he’d been going on stage with, Weber had a bottle of rum. And the spirit on the ship warmed further. “Everyone was in lockdown at home,” Shanks says. “We were spending our evenings in the theatre and the cinema. The beauty salon remained open, the gym and the pool. Everything that was closing around the world was still open to the very end.”“I kept reminding everybody: ‘Get your hair cut, get your nails done, because when you get home you’re going to be locked up, and you’re going to miss us,’” Weber recalls. That was if they ever got home. There were news reports that Trump was not letting ships dock: would they even be allowed off in San Diego?The last night was a big one. “They got every single crew member up on stage, singing and wishing us farewell,” says Dave Morin. “Waiters, cooks, housekeepers, people you never saw from behind the scenes, from the engine room.” Not a dry eye in the house, Weber remembers. There were more tears on the gangway in San Diego the following day – not because they weren’t allowed off, but because they were. It was time to say goodbye. Back home in Massachusetts, the Morins found their weddings had been called off, and they haven’t got a booking this year. But they have a Christmas tree farm, too, and they’re hoping Christmas won’t get cancelled. Weber is enjoying a long, well-earned break. Langstaff’s next job is panto – Jack And The Beanstalk, in Ipswich – but he’s not sure if that’s going to happen, either.Sherry Khan, 80, who describes his and Huguette’s cruise as “a significant emotional event”, won’t be sailing again soon. It’s not that they’ve been put off they just want to wait a while, and maybe not go so far next time. Dave and Vicki, too, and Terri Shanks and Cameron – all of them are looking forward to their next trip. As for the Maasdam, the next cruise, to Mexico and the Sea of Cortez, is due to depart San Diego on 7 October.

Lewinsky was 22.In March, the 42nd president faced criticism after he said the affair was something he did to “manage my anxieties”.“It’s not a defense,” he said, “it’s an explanation. It was awful. I feel terrible.”Lewinsky shared the tweet with the comment: “Uhhhmmmmmm.”Lewinsky has also spoken about how she was demonised and humiliated during the scandal, while Clinton was protected by his power and influence.“I felt like every layer of my skin and my identity were ripped off of me in 1998 and 1999,” she told the  in 2016. “It’s a skinning of sorts … the shame sticks to you like tar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffef459dee9c5e70a8bd2a68a5331f14937fe19f/0_369_5645_3389/master/5645.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9e8be76c25b20c49ffa1f4580cd4b9f4","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

Some fear this will backfireIreland has long greeted American tourists with open arms and the Irish salutation céad míle fáilte, literally, “a hundred thousand welcomes”.An especially warm welcome awaits visitors who are big spenders and descendants of the diaspora.But that was before Covid-19 turned everything upside down and Americans became objects of suspicion – unwanted interlopers from a country which last week surpassed four million cases.Some restaurants and hotels have started turning away US visitors in case they infect staff and other customers with coronavirus, a concern fuelled by surging infection rates in some US states and Ireland’s lax quarantine enforcement.“It’s never a good business model to turn away visitors but this isn’t about business,” said Noel Keane, a chef who recently barred two groups of Americans from Croí restaurant in Tralee, County Kerry. “From a moral point of view, it’s the right thing to do.”The would-be diners admitted they had not self-isolated for 14 days after entering Ireland, compelling a rebuff, said Keane. “I said no. There was no malice. It’s certainly not an anti-American sentiment.”Other businesses have followed suit, some openly, others discreetly.JP McMahon, a chef and owner of Cava Bodega in Galway, started questioning tourists and turning away those that admitted violating quarantine after his staff felt “uncomfortable” serving a group from Texas.The Kings Head pub in Galway and Gregan’s Castle Hotel in County Clare tweeted that they, too, had turned away Americans just off the plane.The Charleville Lodge in Dublin said that it was banning American tourists – even those seeking to quarantine in the hotel: “The government has advised that overseas guests must ‘stay in your hotel or guesthouse’, which means the government is happy to put my staff at risk by being in contact with these guests. This is not self-isolation.”Other establishments may be applying the same policy without advertising the fact.Some Americans who phone hotels are told there is no availability, said Guy Serbin, who runs a Facebook group for US expatriates in Ireland. “Then, when their Irish spouse calls, there are rooms.”Americans who live in Ireland were being lumped in with tourists, said Serbin, 48, an entrepreneur based in Dublin. “I could see myself running into that if I try to book a hotel.”While the pandemic rages, Serbin is not keen on US visitors either. “I don’t think Americans should be travelling anywhere.”Proper controls at the airport and quarantine enforcement could obviate cold shouldering, he said: “The government needs to enforce this at immigration.”Ireland is one of the few EU states that still admits Americans. Aer Lingus runs daily flights to Dublin from Boston, Chicago and New York. American Airlines flies from Dallas. Some 200-250 people disembark daily, a trickle compared to last year.Anjuli Ponce, 28, a social worker from Pennsylvania who has lived in Ireland since 2019, said hotels and restaurants had a duty to protect staff and customers but she was uneasy at the focus on Americans. “Just because you have a certain accent, people assume you’ve just got off the plane. It does feel discriminatory.” Sensitivities appear sharpest in tourist spots outside Dublin, said Ponce.She worries about an upcoming trip to Donegal: “I don’t want people to be uncomfortable and don’t want to be in any confrontation.”But some say Ireland’s tourism industry risks alienating a vital market. “Here we are saying we want to get our industry up and running again but because you have a particular accent we won’t serve you,” said Tony McMahon, the owner of Bellissimo restaurant in Waterford. “If the correct measures are in place it’s not up to us to be judge and jury.”Ireland will need US visitors after the pandemic, said Niall O’Callaghan, chairman of the Association of Visitor Experiences \u0026amp Attractions. “We need to be very cognisant to not bite off the hand that feeds us.”Pat Dawson, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents Association, said Americans were noting the dwindling welcomes. “We have to be very careful about how we deliver that message. They fill many mouths with their dollars when they’re here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e262f2f2578ca3eb574dbea02bf0e4d36c7d5f32/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17b46121b5abee04fd2da753d0131f0","title":"kim jong un conveys urgent meeting after suspected case of covid 19","story":"Kim Jong-un imposes lockdown on Kaesong, calling it a ‘critical situation’ North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid-19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month, state media said on Sunday.If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities, who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of coronavirus.Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong, calling it a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, state news agency KCNA reported.According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.KCNA did not specifically mention whether the inidual had been tested, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries, and imposed strict border closures. Thousands of people in the secretive nation were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.In recent weeks, North Korea has also stepped up a campaign criticising defectors to South Korea as “human scum” and calling for South Korea to crack down on groups that send propaganda messages and food aid into the North.Kim ordered an investigation into the military units along the border where the person was suspected of crossing to “administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d3c0707f0d49a12586c83d3876772da7492960/0_496_6572_3944/master/6572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62f6bbbd4f3354853efa4bc400b8ea3d","title":"moscows fruit stalls become frontline of a border skirmish 2000 miles away","story":"New violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan has provoked anger and boycotts throughout the two countries’ diasporasWhen Saribek Gevorkyan heard reports that Food City, a vast food distribution centre owned by entrepreneurs from Azerbaijan, had suddenly blocked Armenian farmers and turned away 50 truckloads of fresh apricots, he took action. He offered space for free in his own shopping centre to the farmers, helping to host a fruit rescue mission that its organisers have dubbed “Operation Apricot”.“We told our friends that in the Russian Federation nobody can close their doors to us Armenians,” boomed Gevorkyan, the owner of the Shelkovy Put (“Silk Way”) shopping centre. “The Russian Federation is open for everyone to come here, make money, and sell goods.”This month’s military clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which left 17 people dead including a prominent Azeri general, were the worst in four years. Their aftershocks have rippled around the world, sparking violent skirmishes among diaspora communities in the US and Europe and a small-scale economic war in Moscow.The violence appears to be getting worse. In Moscow, Russian media reported that at least 25 people were arrested in a mass brawl late on Thursday night. Video footage appeared to show a group of men targeting the drivers of cars with Armenian licence plates. One Armenian man was reportedly stabbed during the attacks.Video also showed men with sticks storming an Azerbaijani restaurant in Moscow and an Azerbaijani fruit seller was also reportedly attacked. Members of both diaspora communities, as well as the Armenian embassy, have called for restraint.There have been a few hopeful moments. To save the freshly harvested apricots from spoiling, organisers in Moscow’s Armenian diaspora sent out an online alert on behalf of several shopping centres that had given free space to the farmers to sell their stock.The online messages attracted thousands of people, launching an impromptu celebration of the apricot, an Armenian staple. At one shopping centre, people danced a traditional kochari as buyers lugged away crates of fresh fruit.“It turned into quite a beautiful city festival,” said David Tonoyan, who helped organise the campaign. He said that many of the apricots went to charities, hospices and old people’s homes. “It had the effect to bring us closer together in the diaspora.”Asked by the Observer whether Food City had turfed out Armenian sellers, God Nisanov, the chairman of its parent company, Kievskaya Ploshchad, wrote that “following Russian law is an unconditional priority”, and that the company has “continuously demonstrated its care about the interests of consumers, partners and tenants regardless of their nationality or religious beliefs”.While the “apricot war” has ended, there are new reports of Azeri-run businesses barring Armenian products. On Thursday, the Armenian ambassador to Moscow told the news site RBC that Armenian canned foods, mineral water and cognac had all disappeared from a major Moscow supermarket chain owned by an Azeri businessman.The two countries have fought often, particularly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, but it’s rare to see the conflict spill over into commerce in Moscow, where both countries have large diaspora communities.“Even in 2016 during the four-day war with Azerbaijan … there wasn’t this mood in Moscow. This economic war: there’s not been anything like it before,” said Tonoyan, the director of the Armenian Museum of Moscow and Culture of Nations.Experts have warned of a high risk of renewed fighting along the border between the two countries. Richard Giragosian, the founding director of the Regional Studies Centre thinktank in Yerevan, said it could be a “hot summer”.“To rely on political will and the situation on the battlefield for regional stability is dangerous,” he said. “There are no external security guarantees … this is a rare ceasefire that’s upheld only by parties to the conflict without any external actor.”In a new report, the International Crisis Group warns that the clashes “should serve as a warning and call to action”.Tonoyan said that he wanted to do more to protect Armenian farmers and other traders in Russia by helping to organise dedicated selling points.“We asked all Muscovites to come and help out the Armenian farmers, try some tasty apricots, take part in this flashmob and photograph themselves,” he said. “But we all understand this isn’t a permanent solution. So we’re thinking about what’s next.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df4f9144671e10d4f980b360ee6390a504784fd/0_205_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=473c434653d4c9ced33a6b006061fa71","title":"coronavirus live news global cases near 16m covid 19 ad blitz in victoria australia","story":"Florida’s infections overtake New York’s North Korea holds emergency meeting after suspected Covid-19 case reported WHO says 1m cases reported per week for last five weeks.

The committee is being formed to alleviate the hospital’s limited medical resources so doctors can focus on patients with higher survival rates: Twenty-one workers at a steel plant owned by ArcelorMittal in the Mexican port city of Lazaro Cardenas have died from Covid-19, the steelworkers’ trade union said Saturday.Reuters reports that the dead include employees, contractors and suppliers to the plant, said Carlos Solorio, secretary general of the local branch of the national mining and metallurgical workers’ union. “Everyone was working for the company,” Solorio told Reuters. Nine of the deceased were union members, he added.ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer, was not immediately available for comment on the report of the deaths, which were initially made public in a video posted on social media by the union’s president, Senator Napoleon Gomez.Solorio said the 21 deaths had occurred since April, and that the workers likely contracted the virus outside the plant, given the strict sanitary protocols adopted by the firm. The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union.ArcelorMittal has said it has made substantial donations to help tackle the virus in Lazaro Cardenas, a major port on the Pacific coast.With over 385,000 confirmed cases and nearly 43,500 deaths as of Saturday, Mexico has the world’s fourth-highest death toll from coronavirus. Lazaro Cardenas has registered 2,651 cases and 139 deaths to date, official data showed. Australia’s not-for-profit early childcare education sector is struggling to pay up to $9,000 for deep cleaning each time a Covid-19 case is identified, while federal government transition payments may not be enough to keep the sector afloat as parents pull their children out of the system: Here are the key global developments from the last few hours:West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has labelled Clive Palmer a menace after he suggested the coronavirus pandemic was a media “beat-up”, AAP reports. The billionaire mining magnate will front the Federal Court on Monday to challenge WA’s interstate border restrictions. Evidence on whether the closures are constitutional is also being given by the Commonwealth, which argues WA should reopen.A three-day trial will be heard in the Federal Court ahead of the matter returning to the High Court. Mr Palmer has told the Sunday Times the crisis is a “beat-up” and the risk to most people is negligible, attributing most of the deaths to co-morbidities.The premier on Sunday hit back at Mr Palmer, labelling him selfish and irresponsible and urging the federal government to withdraw its involvement in the court matter.“He’s a menace to Australia,” Mr McGowan said.“And I’d just say to the Liberal Party, don’t support him in the High Court - it’s wrong.“It’s irresponsible and it’s playing with people’s lives. Mr Palmer and the Liberal Party should back off from the High Court action.”Mr McGowan said he was confident the state’s legal position was strong, adding that reopening the borders could have a dire health impact.Do you have questions, suggestions or news from your part of the world (that we haven’t mentioned in the blog)? Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Donald Trump has said he has “no responsibility” for the coronavirus pandemic, fobbing it off on governors and mayors whose repeated requests for federal help he’s denied. Yet he’s now sending federal troops into cities he says are controlled by the “radical left”, whose mayors and governors don’t want them there.The president wants to shift public attention from the virus, which he can’t “dominate”, to the streets of America, which he and his secret police can.It’s an especially cynical re-election strategy because coronavirus deaths are rising again. More Americans are on track to be hospitalized with the virus than at any other point. Rates of new infections repeatedly shatter single-day records. As a result, the US economy is backsliding: There are now more than 16 million known coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and 644,528 recorded deaths.Here are the ten countries with the highest numbers of cases: On Saturday the World Health Organisation warned that cases have been growing at around 1m per week for the last few weeks. Looking at the Johns Hopkins tracker, this looks set to change, as the last three days have seen more than 280,000 cases confirmed worldwide per day – if Covid-19 continues to grow at this rate, cases will increase by 2 million per week: In Australia, National party MP Barnaby Joyce has declined to criticise the University of New England over its handling of job cuts in his electorate and sided with education minister, Dan Tehan, over regional universities’ concerns with aspects of higher education reforms.The member for New England told  Australia regional universities stand to gain a “much better funding stream” under the proposed changes and backed UNE vice-chancellor, Brigid Heywood, to “do her job” by identifying savings, and promised not to tell her what to do.Universities including Monash and the University of New South Wales have already announced job cuts triggered by a total projected $16bn loss of revenue in the university sector due to Covid-19: Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan says the plan will further stimulate job creation following the removal of most Covid-19 restrictions within the state. About 120,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost in WA since March, AAP reports. “We estimate that from the reopening of the economy within Western Australia, there’s around 60,000 jobs contained within that,” the premier told reporters.“We expect this plan will deliver many thousands of jobs on top of that.“We’re rushing as fast as we can to get as many projects out the door, as much activity underway as soon as possible.”An AU$66m renewable energy package will fund regional solar power systems, battery energy storage packs and infrastructure upgrades in remote Aboriginal communities. The government has also earmarked $60m for “shovel-ready” maintenance work at police and fire stations.Treasurer Ben Wyatt last December forecast a $2.6bn budget surplus for the 2019-20 financial year. But while the iron ore price has tracked above expectations, other revenue sources have been significantly eroded. The state budget will be handed down the same week as the federal budget in October.“Our focus is jobs activity and confidence,” Mr McGowan said. “Debt and deficits and surpluses come second.“People do talk about the iron ore price and obviously that’s a help. But clearly our GST revenue, our payroll tax revenue, land tax and stamp duty have all gone through the floor.”Back in Australia, the state of Western Australia has committed a total of AU$5.5bn (US$3.9bn) to its coronavirus economic recovery plan, including $2.7bn in new spending, AAP reports. A further $2.7bn will be spent by the McGowan government on rescuing jobs and repairing damage to the West Australian economy from the coronavirus pandemic.The recovery plan, unveiled on Sunday, identifies 21 priority areas but outlines only two new initiatives, with others to be rolled out in coming weeks. It adds to almost $2.8bn in stimulus measures already announced since the start of the pandemic.WA recorded two new coronavirus cases on Sunday. Both are returned overseas travellers who are in hotel quarantine.In total, Costa Rican authorities have reported 14,600 cases and 98 deaths in the country of 5 million people.Despite the increase in cases, hotels are operational and the government has announced European, British, and Canadian tourists will be allowed to enter the country beginning 1 August, Costa Rica reports. A bit more on the UK requiring travellers from Spain – including the UK transport minister – to self-isolate: Passengers arriving from Spain will have to self-isolate for two weeks, the UK government has said, in a move that has reportedly caught out its transport minister who is holidaying in the country, AFP reports. From Sunday, Britons returning from the popular destination must self-isolate, following a surge in coronavirus cases there, a UK government spokesman said Saturday.The snap move is a blow to Britons seeking some Mediterranean sun after months of lockdown at home - including Transport Minister Grant Shapps, according to the Sunday Times and other media reports.Shapps had to phone in from Spain to the “crisis meeting” of ministers that removed it from the list of countries exempted from self-quarantine, the newspaper said, sparking ridicule online and further criticism of the government’s response to Covid-19.“Various government ministers would have known in advance there was a possibility of imposing a quarantine on holidaymakers returning from Spain,” tweeted Labour MP Diane Abbot. “But apparently no-one bothered to tell @grantshapps.”Spain, one of the most popular summer destinations for Britons, has reported a rise in new infections barely a month after it ended its months-long state of emergency. Health officials are increasingly pointing to nightlife as fertile ground for the spread of the virus.The UK move comes as Spain’s tourism industry desperately seeks a rebound after the virus and lockdown pushed around 13 percent of bars, hotels and restaurants to permanently close.Britain is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, but that does not apply to the Canary Islands or the Balearic Islands.Spain has been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic which has so far claimed more than 28,000 lives there and infected more than 272,000 people.Here is the full story on the New South Wales Supreme court ruling in favour of police, effectively banning a Black Lives Matter protest planned for Tuesday in Sydney. Activists say the rally will go ahead.The court on Sunday sided with police and dubbed the event a prohibited public assembly, opening up demonstrators to arrest and fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions on mass gatherings.But seconds after Justice Mark Ierace announced his orders, a lawyer for the rally organiser Paddy Gibson asked they be temporarily suspended to allow for an appeal to be lodged with the court of appeal.The court was told on Friday Gibson had threatened to take the matter all the way to the high court: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 305 to 205,269, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Sunday.The reported death toll was unchanged with 9,118, the tally showed.Australia’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, reckons Treasurer Josh Frydenberg admitting he draws his inspiration from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan will send a “shudder down the spine” of every Australian worker, AAP reports. “Thatcher and Reagan are figures of hate for the left because they were so successful,” Frydenberg told ABC television’s Insiders program on Sunday.“Josh Frydenberg thinks the solution to this job crisis is to double down on trickle-down economics and even more job insecurity,” Chalmers, the shadow treasurer told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday in response to the statement. Former Republican US President Ronald Reagan is renowned for supporting “trickle-down economics” or “Reaganomics”, where large tax cuts, for example, trickle down through the economy.Former Conservative UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher also took a tough stance on trade unions, reducing the number of days lost to industrial disputes from 30 million down to two million, according to Mr Frydenberg.He believes they both dealt successfully with the challenges of the 1970s and 1980s.“Josh Frydenberg confirms his inspiration for the economic recovery is Thatcher and Reagan which resulted in a massive increase in inequality and reduction in public services #GoodGrief,” he tweeted.Here is the full story Australia’s deadliest day in the pandemic so far.A national record of 10 Covid-19 deaths was reported in Victoria on Sunday, including a man aged in his 40s, with seven of those deaths linked to aged care.The premier, Daniel Andrews, also announced that 459 more cases of the virus had been identified since Saturday, and acknowledged the toll the virus was having among healthcare workers who were being infected or furloughed after being exposed.There are now 381 healthcare workers with active cases of the virus, the premier said:David Dungay Jr’s nephew Paul Silva told  Australia the rally will go ahead, regardless of today’s decision.“Our family is going to take to the streets to demand justice,” Silva said.“The only way that’s going to stop this protest is if the Premier calls SAfe Work New South Wales and calls the department of public prosecutions to undertake an investigation. Otherwise, we’ll continue to take to the streets, whether it be with 40 people, or 40,000 people.“Our family is determined to get justice for David Dungay Jr. and demand systematic change for the First Nations people here in Australia.“The Australian Government, New South Wales courts and New South Wales police should be very grateful that we’re not looting and rioting, like what’s happening in the US.”Silva said they are committed to peaceful protests.“We just know that violence isn’t going solve this.“These are peaceful protests and we’re going to demand justice in a peaceful way until someone in government hears our voices and steps up to the table and says enough’s enough.

Photograph: KCNAAFP via Getty ImagesNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of being infected with coronavirus returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border, state media said on Sunday.If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities.Mr Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, KCNA reported.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on July 19 after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.KCNA did not say if the person had been tested, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.One analyst said the announcement was important, not only because North Korea was for the first time reporting a suspected coronavirus case but also because it suggested it was appealing for help.“It’s an ice-breaking moment for North Korea to admit a case,” said Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University.“It could be reaching out to the world for help. Perhaps for humanitarian assistance.”North Korea is under huge economic pressure because of international sanctions over its nuclear programme.Cho Han-bum, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said it was significant that North Korea was reporting its first suspected coronavirus case was imported.“North Korea is in such a dire situation, where they can’t even finish building the Pyongyang General Hospital on time. Pointing the blame at an ‘imported case’ from South Korea, the North can use this as a way to openly accept aid from the South.”KCNA did not elaborate on how the “runaway” had crossed one of the world’s most heavily guarded borders but said the incident was being investigated and the military unit responsible would face “severe punishment”.South Korean officials were checking to see if a defector had indeed crossed back into the North this month, the South’s Yonhap news agency reported.North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries and imposed strict border closures.Thousands of people in North Korea were also quarantined as it took precautions to prevent a coronavirus outbreak but restrictions had recently been eased.-ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet.

Others are committing to staying at home for the whole year, even if the schools reopen.Proponents say these pods offer a nifty solution - lonely children are reunited with their peers and families can share the cost of hiring a teacher, all while mitigating the risk of spreading infection.Julie Frandsen, from Pacific Grove, California said she began looking into the idea when her teenage daughter\u0027s private school announced that they would be continuing with remote learning until January.The story of my daughter\u0027s last year in high school can\u0027t be just her sitting in her room, she said. They don\u0027t have access to anybody and they\u0027ve got to get off their screens.Ms Frandsen said she plans to band together with two or three other families whose children are in the same classes as her daughter to eat lunch and work on projects together to give a sense of normality to the school day.Ms Frandsen, who works in healthcare, said the group have had frank conversations about what level of exposure to the coronavirus they are prepared to risk.Those conversations reflect the increasing tension playing out across the country, where the debate over when children should return to classrooms increasingly ided over political lines.While Donald Trump has pushed for schools to open their doors, several of the country\u0027s largest school districts, including Los Angeles, have ruled out in-person learning for the foreseeable future and teaching unions have accused the US president of failing to offer the resources to reopen safely.Amanda Uhry, who runs Manhattan Private School Advisors, said New Yorkers are particularly cautious despite the city\u0027s comparatively low rate of Covid-19 cases, with parents opting to rent out vacant storefronts for five to seven children to be taught by a teacher.Ms Uhry said she has helped arrange 70 such learning pods in the city, but stressed that she has her reservations about the idea.Are pods fair? No, they\u0027re not because the minority child in the city isn\u0027t going to them - they cost money. But she added: This is New York, it\u0027s full of demanding parents. This is what I\u0027ll be dealing with 24 hours a day.But Ms Keller, who says she has been receiving calls from parents across northern California, disputes the idea that these new learning groups connote privilege.Many of these parents are struggling to make it but they\u0027re choosing it because it\u0027s important to them, she said. They\u0027re are a lot of people out there who are doing this stuff who don\u0027t have money, they\u0027re just juggling more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"black ethnic minority people feature british coins notes first","story":"Black and ethnic minority people are set to feature on British money for the first time, the Sunday  can reveal.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking at proposals by a campaign group to put influential BAME figures from throughout history on a set of coins, a Treasury minister said.There has never been a non-white person featured on British coins or notes, and the Banknotes of Colour campaign, led by former Conservative candidate Zehra Zaidi, has been fighting for representation.Ms Zaidi, along with a group of historians and MPs, has written to the chancellor with some proposed historic figures, including the first Indian and Gurkha soldiers to receive the Victoria Cross, the Jamaican British nurse Mary Seacole, and the British Muslim woman, Noor Inayat Khan, one of only four women to receive the George Cross.The plans have been submitted to the Royal Mint, which has been encouraged by the Treasury to come up with some proposals and designs for potential coins.Treasury minister John Glen told The  the chancellor was keen to support the timely proposal.He added: “The chancellor is aware of this, we are obviously supportive and keen to be positive about it, we need to see some firm proposals from the Royal Mint but we are keen for this to happen. The chancellor is reflecting on the letter from Zehra and will reply in due course.”Mr Sunak has previously expressed support for the anti-racist cause. He said:  As a British Asian of course I know that racism exists in this country. And I know people are angry and frustrated. They want to see, and feel, change. But a better society doesn’t happen overnight – like all great acts of creation, it happens slowly and depends on the cooperation of each of us toward that common goal.Ms Zaidi said in a letter to the Chancellor: We propose a specific next theme of service to the nation by Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people, both in military conflict and on the home front.This theme will unite people, especially now as the nation has come together through the pandemic, and is collectively recognising the heroic work by ethnic minority staff in our health and care services.It is surely essential that this country does not lose another opportunity to demonstrate that the contributions of Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority groups are truly valued. Symbols matter, and we urge you to support our campaign.Her campaign is supported by a host of historians and MPs, including Conservative Tom Tugendhat and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas.Tom Tugendhat MP added: “For hundreds of years people from around the world have played a part in our nation’s history. Reformers, soldiers, writers, activists and carers have shaped our communities and lives. It’s right we celebrate all those who were so important, from the sailors on HMS Victory to the many I served with, I’m proud of the heroic thread that began centuries ago and continues to bind us together.”Kate Williams, historian and broadcaster said: Representation matters. This is a multi cultural country and people from all over the world have come here and contributed. Yet our commemorative items show elite white men.Not only is this a lie about history but it sends a very negative message to those of colour who come here, who’ve fought to abolish slavery, broken down barriers, supported post war Britain, fought in our world wars, given their all to the NHS, set up businesses, created great art...it says to them, your work does not matter. Change is long overdue.”Professor Sunny Singh, academic, writer and founder of the Jhalak Prize said in support of the campaign:  “There is no better way to acknowledge the history of Britain in the world than to include a high achieving Briton of colour on our legal tender.Such an action honours British history at home and of the Empire, recognises that significant parts of our contemporary wealth can be traced back to our colonial past, and also opens a path to a common national future of knowledge, equality and reconciliation.Ms Zaidi was previously behind a campaign to get the Bank of England to select a person of colour for the £20 note, proposing Mary Seacole or Noor Inayat Khan.

In the criminal courts alone, victims face waits of up to two years as the backlog has grown from 446,000 to 552,000 during lockdown.Internal data from the Ministry of Justice’s (MoJ) Bury St Edmunds orce centre shows there is a 15-week delay before a legal adviser will even consider a decree nisi applications. Lawyers who logged on to get timing updates last week were told that the centre is only now processing “correspondence including emails” that were received on April 1, nearly four months ago.“We are saying to clients that we are expecting a minimum of six months to get the paperwork through the court system,” said Jemma Pollock, Senior Associate at Russell-Cooke. “Some are experiencing delays more than that.“I had clients who had started court proceedings pre-Covid and their entire lives were put on hold. Some were still living together and had to spend four months in the same house. Now coming out of lockdown four months down the line and they still haven’t got resolution.”The MoJ is planning “Nightingale” courts, evening and weekend sittings and greater use of video and remote hearings to increase capacity to clear the backlogs but the legal profession is resistant to longer hours.The MoJ said the justice system had kept running during the pandemic and urgent cases involving domestic abuse and child safety had been “rightly prioritised.” It pointed to digital orces, of which hundreds were processed each week, and repossession cases would resume on August 24.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london cab drivers accuse sadiq khan prioritising cyclists buses","story":"London cab drivers have likened Sadiq Khan to a “lunatic taking over an asylum” for prioritising cyclists and buses on the capital\u0027s streets, as their earnings fall with traffic being forced into gridlock.To help reduce car usage and demand on public transport, the Mayor of London has created 17km of new cycle lanes throughout the city, with 15,000m2 of extra pavement space to enable social distancing on streets.But this has led to people shunning cabs in Central London to avoid the increased fares charged by drivers forced to travel further in search of drop-off points, according to Darryl Cox, Secretary of the London Cab Drivers Club.He is particularly critical of the installation of pop-up cycle lanes in tourist heavy areas such as Euston Road and Park Lane where demand for taxi services is still below pre-lockdown levels.Speaking on behalf of his 1000 members, Mr Cox told The Sunday : “The traffic is gridlocked because Sadiq Khan has helped massively increase the amount of bike lanes being constructed around central locations. There is also restricted access to the roads which are being re-designed purely for cyclists, buses and pedestrians.”“It is now harder for us to drop and pick up passengers - especially disabled ones- at some stations as there are fewer spaces to pull over. The lunatic has taken over the asylum.”Under ambitious proposals to transform parts of Central London into car-free zones, Mr Khan also plans to create a series of “bus-only corridors” within sections of Zone 1.However, taxi groups claim the scheme will make it harder to travel around the city centre, which is suffering huge losses as many arts spaces and hospitality venues remain closed.Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u0027 Association, added: “Any policy which deters people from coming into Central London and safely resuming their old routines, especially those who do not feel safe using public transport and for whom walking and cycling is simply not an option, will undermine London\u0027s recovery and do further economic harm.”A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: “Sadiq makes no apologies for the temporary emergency measures he has put in place to encourage Londoners to make as many journeys as possible by bike or on foot to help enable social distancing on public transport, and prevent a car-based recovery leading to one public health crisis being replaced with another.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen jokes empty teacup posed new official portrait first","story":"The Queen has accomplished another \u0027world first\u0027 of her reign during lockdown: the “virtual unveiling” of her new portrait.And, despite seeing it for the first time via videocall, it was clear she has not lost her eagle eye.The Queen joked that a teacup featuring in her painting had no tea in it, the artist revealed, as she paid tribute to her “luminous” sitter.Miriam Escofet, winner of the BP Portrait Award, has painted a new portrait of the Queen, commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a “lasting tribute to Her Majesty’s service” to diplomacy.The Queen saw the painting in its new home at the FCO for the first time via her computer screen, before speaking to members of staff about their work around the world during the coronavirus crisis.She told staff she was impressed with their efforts to repatriate British citizens, as well as their coordination of the global search for a vaccine and rapid mobilisation of resources after the Covid-19 pandemic hit.It is the 13th portrait the Queen has sat for since 2010, and is destined to be hung in the new reception of the FCO’s London headquarters when it is completed next year.Buckingham Palace explained the FCO had wanted to “pay tribute to their longstanding relationship with The Queen, and the contribution Her Majesty has made to UK diplomacy throughout her reign”.The Queen has visited more than 100 countries at the request of the FCO and hosted 111 inwards state visits, said Sir Simon McDonald, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Head of the Diplomatic Service.The Queen sat for the painting in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, wearing a blue day dress, a triple- string pearl necklace, earrings and drop brooch.Speaking during the official unveiling, artist Miriam Escofet told the Queen she had included a hidden symbol in the painting - the insignia of the FCO - painted onto a tea cup, inspired by the anamorphic distortion technique used by Renaissance painters in including Holbein.“It felt really right to apply it to the tea cup - suddenly this very humble object carries this symbolism representing the FCO and linking the portrait to its destination,” said Escofet.“I explained this to the Queen and she made this very humorous comment about how there’s no tea in the cup.“I said I’m afraid the tea has been sacrificed for the symbolism.”The painting took seven months to complete, with the final stages being completed in lockdown.Escofet had been granted two sittings with the Queen: one at Windsor where she spent around half an hour photographing Her Majesty in situ to perfect the composition, and the second at Buckingham Palace in February to focus on her facial expressions.On the challenges of painting the Queen, she said she had tried to capture her aura of regalness while being a very humane portrait as well.Sir Simon said the FCO was delighted with the finished portrait, which will hang in the new reception building in pride of place.“It’s terrific,” he said. “There’s truth and dignity and wisdom in the portrait.”Of the Queen’s praise for the FCO’s response to Covid-19, he added: “We are Her Majesty’s diplomatic service. There is a bond between this organisation and the monarch.“For people to be able to say that the Queen was interested and impressed with their work is a wonderful and really motivating thing.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sante another champagne giant uncorks plans buy english vineyard","story":"French Champagne makers are producing English sparkling wine through gritted teeth as the Kent countryside continues to rival northern French vineyards.Champagne house Taittinger has started making fizz in Kent, known as the Garden of England, after it was identified as having the perfect conditions for grape-growing thanks to its chalk soils, climate and topography.And now it has emerged that LVMH – the company behind world-leading champagne brands Moët \u0026amp Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug, Ruinart and Mercier – is also looking to buy up an English vineyard.Hannah Heerema, who, with her husband Eric, owns the Nyetimber estate in Kent, famed for its English sparkling wine, revealed: For years, the French have been so scathing about English wine – and now Taittinger have planted, Pommerey have done a joint venture and LVMH are looking.The tide is changing, I think, and the French are concerned that, with temperatures rising in the north of France and England, England is going to be the sweet spot in the decades to come.Brad Geatrix – who, along with his wife Cherie Spriggs, is Nyetimber\u0027s chief winemaker – said that because the French weren\u0027t able to call fizz bottled outside the region Champagne, they were making English sparkling wine through gritted teeth.Ms Spriggs won the prestigious International Wine Challenge Sparkling Winemaker of the Year award in 2018, the first time someone from outside the Champagne region had won.Taittinger chose a vineyard near the Kent village of Chilham as the site for its venture into English sparkling wine, with the first bottle produced there due to be drunk in 2024.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"side hungarys media crackdown","story":"Concerns over the independence of the media in Hungary have been reignited after dozens of journalists from one of the country’s last independent news sites quit en masse, alleging the government was trying to interfere with, or destroy, their organisation.In total 70 journalists resigned from Index after Szabolcs Dull, its editor, was sacked. Officially, he was removed for failing to deal with issues in the newsroom. But the editor’s supporters said the sacking was “clear interference” and an attempt to pressure the news site to toe a pro-government line.Fears over the future of Index were ignited in March when Miklos Vaszily, businessman that backs prime minister Viktor Orbán, bought a 50 per-cent stake in the firm that controls Index’s advertising and revenue. Although Mr Vaszily denies wanting to exert any editorial influence, his critics claim that he helped transform Origo, another Hungarian website, into a pro-government organisation.Once news of the mass resignation from Index broke, protesters took to the streets in Budapest on Friday evening.Addressing the demonstrators Andras Fekete-Gyor, leader of Momentum, an opposition party, said the “journalists of Index had demonstrated the value of having a moral backbone in this country.”But the protests may have little effect. Mr Orban and his party have a strong position in the Hungarian parliament, and in the past have proved impervious to the frequent accusations that they are undermining Hungarian democracy. The Hungarian government has also always denied that it poses a threat to the country’s free media.Marianna Bíró, a journalist at Index told The Sunday : Today, the political power in Hungary denies the function of journalists. The media only has one weapon left in this massacre: decency.”Balázs Pándi, another employee who walked out, said: This isn\u0027t the first time a cold shower has been deployed. The question is how long this will be tolerated.”Index has become regarded as a bastion of independent journalism in a Hungarian media landscape increasingly dominated by print and broadcast media with close ties to Fidesz, the governing party led by Viktor Orban, the prime minister.The hollowing out of independent media inside Hungary comes amid a push to spread Mr Orban\u0027s message abroad, uncovered today by The Sunday .An investigation found a slew of English-language websites promoting the message and illiberal philosophy of Mr Orban, raising fears that Hungary is following in the “disinformation” footsteps of authoritarian governments.Alleged propaganda websites, with connections to the Hungarian government, masquerade as legitimate news sources, purporting to bring Hungarian and regional news to an international audience.Remix News, one of the websites in question, is, for example, often linked to from the About Hungary Facebook page, which is run by the Hungarian state.Based in Budapest it is, according to its own information, an organisation that offers “news and commentary from Central Europe”. But to its critics it is one of a number of websites with opaque backgrounds allegedly spreading propaganda supporting the government of Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, beyond Hungary’s borders while posing as legitimate news sources.Their presence has prompted allegations that Hungary is following in the footsteps of autocratic regimes such as Russia, Iran and China by using bogus news websites to disseminate pro-government stories.“Hungary has become a regional disinformation power, and certainly Hungary is expanding its own misinformation machinery,” said Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist working for Direkt36, a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Budapest. “I’m not aware of a similar country doing this apart from the likes of Russia and China.”A quick click away from Remix is V4NA. A UK-registered company founded in 2018 by Hungary’s then ambassador to London it turns out stories each day, many of which share a similar theme to those found on Remix. Articles attacking migration, the EU and George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier whom the Orban government regards as an enemy of state, proliferate.The stories reflect issues that lie close to the heart of the Hungarian government. Since coming into power in 2010 Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has become a resolute opponent of migration, a fierce critic of Brussels and Mr Soros, and a proponent of what the prime minister has termed “illiberal democracy”.This has led to frequent clashes with Brussels and prompted widespread allegations that the Hungarian government is intent on eroding democratic norms and civil society in order to shape the country to its ideological designs—something it strenuously denies.“Orban plays to an international field, and he needs international allies in his fight against the EU,” said Agnes Urban, a media analyst at the Hungarian media watchdog Mertek Media Monitor. “This pro-government narrative about Hungary helps communicate his anti-democratic views.Barna Borbas, a Hungarian journalist who has written extensively about V4NA for the conservative newspaper Valasz Online, believes V4NA’s “goal is to make the messages and strategic goals of the Hungarian government more visible in Europe”.This is perhaps not surprising given that Arpad Harbony, one of Mr Orban’s key advisors and man sometimes called the “Hungarian Dominic Cummings”, has a share in V4NA, while V4NA’s parent company is part of the Central European Press and Media Foundation, a media-holding containing a number of pro-government newspapers and radio stations in Hungary. V4NA failed to respond to an interview request from The .Remix is owned by FWD Affairs, a “strategic communications and media agency” in Budapest, founded in 2010 by Patrick Egan, an American political consultant. Although appearing to keep a low profile in Hungary he has spoken at a number of events linked to Fidesz, which are, according to one expert on Hungarian affairs who preferred not to be named, the “darkest chambers of governmental propaganda”.In the past FWD Affairs has also carried out work for the prime minister’s office, winning, for example, a contract in 2015 “to support international communications activities”.Along with publishing Remix it also handles the English-language editing of a Hungarian-state backed website called Transylvania Now. Although designed primarily to promote Romania’s Transylvania region, which was once part of Hungary and still home to a large Hungarian population, the website has political content, often critical of the Romanian authorities while supporting the Hungarian government.Like V4NA, FWD is also a company that appears to shun publicity. Its website consists of one page, and offers no contact information other than a box in which to write a message. It also made no response to attempts by The  to contact it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

Speaking at a Comic-Con@Home panel, the Oscar-winning actor recalled feeling “insulted” when she realised how different women were treated in the action film genre. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, she also said the incident had made her determined to “outdrive all of those guys”.“For sure, The Italian Job was a great experience, in the sense that I realised there was still so much misconception around women in the genre, even though in that film the action is really based on cars,” she said during the panel. “We had to physically do a lot of that stuff.

And I was like ‘alright, you guys want to play this game? Let’s go’.

The pop star collaborated with a number of her “musical heroes” for the record, including her frequent songwriting partner and co-producer Jack Antonoff, plus The National’s Aaron Dessner, and Bon Iver. Upon the album’s release, Swift shared a prologue of sorts explaining her thoughts and feelings surrounding the album. The prologue will also feature in packaging for CD and vinyl versions of Folklore.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRead the prologue in full below:“It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.Alanis Morissette’s Such Pretty Forks in the Road is a career bestTaylor Swift fans think Karlie Kloss dropped a Folklore Easter Egg “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of “let’s run away” and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.“Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn’t his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.“A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone’s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I’ve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.“Now it’s up to you to pass them down.”Swift’s album has received critical claim in early reviews.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness. The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside.

There was no discussion about the matter. Churchill was a racist, and that’s that. Also he caused the deaths of three million people in Bengal through a famine in .As it happens, the famine was caused by a tropical cyclone. These pieces were not “news” and so should not have been on The Ten O’Clock News. Andthey were to appear anywhere they should have been balanced.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess.

It’s a call to action, a national effort that we need.“I’ve thought for a long time that keeping people healthy is the best way to keep them out of hospital. Covid has doubled down on that.“After your age and sex, the third biggest impact on whether you will dieyou catch Covid is obesity.“It’s the third-biggest impact on how hard it hits you.“So I’ve long believed the NHS isn’t just about fixing people when they’re ill. It’s about helping people when they’re healthy.“It’s the National Health Service, not the National Hospital Service. Tackling obesity is the No health issue after Covid.“But it’s linked to Covid too as it shows how dangerous obesity is.

We have got the biggest package of support for tackling obesity in history.“My experience of Covid is that I bounced back. But so many people didn’t. You just have to look at the figures to see the link.“I got quite fit during the general election campaign and I lost some weight. I’m just so glad that I did, because it helped.”As part of the drive, the TV industry faces restrictions on showing junk food ads before pm and there are plans to constrain such promotions online.Supermarket buy-one-get-one-free deals also face new rules and calorie counts on restaurant and takeaway- chain menus will come into force.Mr Hancock, who is often tempted by his daughter’s lemon meringue pie, is adamant the whole country has to show discipline on losing weight just like it obeyed lockdown measures.He says: “There is a huge role for parents to look out for the health of their children. We want to support parents to do that.“You wouldn’t give your child a cigarette. Parents have a responsibility that they eat healthily too.”“Teachers have a big role to play as well in this national effort. I applaud the Daily Mile [for young children to jog or run for  minutes daily at school] and there are lots of ways to exercise.”Offices and firms across the land are also being asked to buy into the new push.He says: “For all employers, for companies and bosses, Covid has shown health impacts on the bottom line. It’s in bosses’ interests to help their employees stay fit.”Doctors will also have a greater role to play in being more frank with patientsthey are obese or overweight.Patients will be referred to weight-loss services and told to head out walking and cycling as part of the new drive.Diners will be able to benefit from Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out To Help Out from next Saturday.Askedan anti-obesity drive and starting the promotion is the best idea, Mr Hancock says, dryly: “Eat healthily to help out.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Firstly, Keir Starmer askedJohnson had a message for people whose relatives had suffered from coronavirus – and he replied that Starmer had “more briefs than Calvin Klein”. It’s not only hilarious, but I’m sure it comforted grieving relatives. Then he responded to Starmer’s questions about the delayed report on Russian interference with our elections, by saying Starmer had “more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach”. Another glorious joke and one that certainly puts all our minds at ease about Vladimir Putin. So here are some others he can try, about himself. If he’s asked how much protective equipment his government provided for medical staff during the pandemic, he can say “We gave them less protection than a chemist’s at the Vatican”. If he’s asked what happened to the track and tracing he promised would “lead the world”, he can say “It’s had more failed dates than the history of Tinder”. He can tell us “Dominic Cummings has more implausible stories than Hollyoaks” and “his eyesight needs more checks than a chess tournament”. He can say “I consumed more coke than Sheffield steelworks” and I have “more kids I’ve forgotten about than an amnesiac goat herder”. Everyone seems to agree he’s a great speaker, witty and able to communicate clearly in a language we all understand. For example, there was the inspiring speech he gave to the West Yorkshire Police that began: “Everyone’s learning the caution, you know the caution, you know what you have to say, you do not have to say anything. “Is that right  Anything you butyou fail to mention something, which you later, hang on, is that right ” What is so reassuring about a speech like that is we’re all thinking it, but he’s the only one capable of putting it into words. It’s also a measure of his kindness that when he speaks he also give us a free puzzle, in which we have to try to put the words into an order that makes an actual sentence. Sometimes he explains ideas with even more clarity by throwing in a chunk of Latin, and some think “that means he MUST be clever”. We should extend this to everyone. If someone working class says “I tell you what, right, here, listen, you know that wotnot, well ipso facto modus operandi I tell you that for nuffink”, we should all say “what a splendid educated fellow he must be”.

And the Health Secretary added that without them, the health service would die.Boris Johnson singled out the two nurses who tended him – when his own le hung in the balance as he was racked by Covid- – for their dedication, skill and overwhelmingkindness.The PM also rightly recognised that they were typical of the hundreds of thousands of others putting their own lives at risk to save others. Yet in the public sector pay round last week, Mr Hancock and Mr Johnson left nurses out. They have every right to feel hurt, undervalued – and bloody furious.  So much so that, as the Sunday Mirror reveals today, , of them are now considering quitting.  That would be both a tragedy and a disaster. It is true that nurses, along with other NHS workers, agreed a three-year pay deal which does not run out until next March. In normal times, they would have stuck to their side of the bargain and not expected a rise until then. But these are not normal times. These are the most extraordinary times the NHS has been through since its  foundation.  Hospital staff have performed superhuman feats to care for the sick and dying, and hundreds have died themselves doing it. We clapped for them because it was the only way under lockdown we could express our immense and heartfelt gratitude. Mr Johnson verbally patted them on the back. Now he has slapped them in the face. Just as the coronavirus has changed all our lives, it should also change how we reward those who have given their all. That means starting pay negotiations now to ensure a hefty rise is in wage packets by Christmas. This is not the most you can do for them, Mr Johnson. It is the least. Act of comfort  The argument in favour of a Child Burial Fund to help parents hold funerals for their most precious loved ones was unassailable. Labour’s Carolyn Harris made it time and again in the Commons. The Sunday Mirror campaigned alongside her. And behind the scenes so did most MPs, including Theresa May when she was PM. Only the stone-hearted scrooges in the Treasury stood in the way. A year ago the argument was finally won and the Treasury coughed up the cash.

Here, in his own words, he shares his story... Have you ever sat on the bus and seen someone making a strange noise  Perhaps you moved away, feeling uncomfortable. Well, that person was possibly someone like me. I have Tourette’s Syndrome . Which means sometimes I make weird noises and twitch. Sometimes this freaks people out. You might assume all people with Tourette’s shout out swear words. But actually coprolalia – as it’s known – affects only % of us. I like to swear as much as the next Yorkshireman, but I don’t do it uncontrollably as part of my Tourette’s. There are many misconceptions about this neurological condition. My tics began when I was seven. I would snf loudly or let out a kind of ‘whooping’ noise. With little awareness on the topic, my parents had no clue what it could be. It took a primary school teacher to gently suggest I might have Tourette’s after watching a documentary. My mum, Annette, did her research after that, and within a few weeks we travelled from our home in Bradford to London’s Great Ormond Street, where the hospital confirmed the diagnosis. There is no cure for Tourette’s, but treatment can help manage symptoms. I was put on medication to help calm the tics. It didn’t work, but it made me pile on the pounds. So now I had my weight as well as tics to feel self-conscious about. I had no real understanding of what was happening, but that year I wrote to Father Christmas begging him to make me ‘normal’. People often ask what the tics feel like. Sometimes they are conscious, sometimes they aren’t. For the ones that are, it’s like an urge to scratch a bad mosquito bite – the more you resist the itch, the bigger it becomes. But when you finally scratch, after a moment of relief, the sensation s.  A tic can be anything from a noise, twitch or cough, to rapid head movements, finger clicks, deep breaths and whistles. It gets worse when you’re stressed, sick, nervous or excited, and everyone’s dferent. In public, during a bad day, it’s often mortying. I remember one of the visits to London when I was eight. Feeling excited about the train, the tics were prominent. I let out some ‘whoops’ and a man in the carriage shouted, ‘Will someone please shut that child up!’ My mum was furious on my behalf, but I felt such shame. It’s for this reason so many kids with Tourette’s shut themselves away. I was bullied, with name calling including ‘spastic’, ‘retard’ and ‘abortion’. Kids can be a***holes, and sometimes the teachers were unwittingly as bad. I got sent out of class when my vocal tics were aggravated. Standing in the hallway felt like a punishment for something I couldn’t help. And there was the supply teacher who yelled, ‘What on earth is wrong with you, boy ’ in front of the whole class. Even when people tried to be kind, hurtful situations arose. When our neighbours held a birthday party for their son, I’d been allowed early access on the bouncy castle. But when the guests arrived I was told it was ‘just for adults’ now and sent home. The next few hours were spent in my bedroom, tears rolling, as I listened to kids bouncing with glee. They were embarrassed about the twitching kid who makes noises. I hated being dferent.  So many kids with TS are full of self-loathing. I feel it’s my duty to help educate the next generation. There needs to be more compassion and understanding, so children aren’t scared and so judged. And while this may seem like a sorrowful tale, it’s actually not. Thankfully, le slowly improved. At senior school, aged , I had asked the headmaster to announce in assembly I had TS and explain what it was. This actually helped kids and staff become more tolerant. I learned an important lesson in facing problems head-on. While I wasn’t popular, I did have some friends. I was around  when I realised that channelling my energy into my passions – writing, drama, entrepreneurial projects – saw my tics begin to slow down and even disappear in some cases. These became coping mechanisms, greatly reducing the urges to tic. Truth is, people with Tourette’s have a superpower that, when channelled into something they love, makes them unstoppable. Intertwine this with ious cognitive behavioural therapies , such as meditation and positive mental attitude techniques, and it sets us a world apart. At  I landed a place at Lancaster University, studying marketing management, which I loved. I also ‘came out’. I’d had crushes on boys since I was , so this was a massive relief.  I first became interested in wine when, during my course, I spent a year in San Francisco. I met an amazing couple who became like family to me, Steve and Rose Smith. I’d often shadow them on weekends at their winery, and their love for wine completely rubbed off on me – the senses, the smells, the tasting profiles. I was hooked, and it kick-started my career in the wine industry. I now write a wine and spirits column, and through this world met my incredible friends Helena Nicklin and Colin Hampden-White. Together, we created an award-winning TV series on Amazon Prime called The Three Drinkers. You might wonder how the hell a person with Tourette’s ended up as a TV presenter  Interestingly, when the cameras roll, I’m so focused on doing what I love, my tics go away and viewers have no idea. Tourette’s doesn’t just ‘disappear’, of course. It’s with us forever, although statistically it calms down with age. Confidence issues can greatly affect people with TS. Take dating. ‘Will anyone ever fall in love with me ’ is a concern that worries many of us. On a first date my tics can go unnoticed, some of us learn to mask them. But by the time someone comes over for dinner they get more obvious. People ask, ‘Have you got hiccups ’ and you have to work out when best to tell them. I don’t exactly want to pull out the TS leaflets over the second bottle of wine. I’m still navigating this. My le will never be ‘normal’, and I’ll continue getting odd looks. But I’m happy and successful. These days I see having Tourette’s not as my weakness, but my biggest strength.  Touretteaposs – the facts WHAT IS TOURETTE’S  A neurological condition characterised by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalisations called tics.

Now, when I hear a new dog is coming into my le I can barely sleep. I am so excited. What will they look like  How will their personality be  What challenges will I need to help them overcome  I’ve always been a dog lover, but was never allowed one when I was growing up in Essex. Then in my late teens, I met a guy who did not like dogs – our relationship lasted  years, so getting a four-legged friend had not been an option. When he and I eventually split in , he moved out of our Gloucestershire cottage, and I thought, ‘Sod it! I’ve only myself to please now.’  It was back in September, soon after the break-up, when I contacted the Dogs Trust and applied to be a foster carer. As a single woman I couldn’t afford to buy a dog, and the beauty of volunteering to foster means that the charity covers the cost of food and anything  you need to buy for the dog while in your care, including any vet bills. Interview stage There were interviews, home visits and paperwork – I passed all the requirements. As a gardener, I can take a dog with me to work most days, so it wouldn’t be left alone, plus I have a garden and live near the Forest of Dean, perfect for walking. And I don’t have children or any other pets to worry about, so I was seen as a good option. From a selfish point of view, I was looking forward to sharing my empty home with someone  again. Another warm body on the sofa next to me.  It was in March, just as coronavirus was sweeping the nation, when Dogs Trust Evesham rang. They had a nine-month-old Collie cross-breed who’d been rescued from dire conditions where  dogs had been kept in a barn. Could I take her in until they found her a permanent home  Melted my heart Well, they brought Athena to my garden and my heart just melted at the first sight of her pretty face. She wasn’t used to human contact, so I didn’t make a huge fuss. I let her snf around my garden as I drank a cup of tea, just watching her. By that first evening she was laying her head in my lap. I had to toilet train her, which involved heaps of praise when she went outside. If she had accidents inside I never told her off, I just quickly cleaned it up. I got through plenty of cleaning products, but after a week she’d got the hang of it. As I busily worked in clients’ gardens, I listened to audiobooks on dog behaviours and training to educate myself. Athena stayed for three and a half weeks before it was time for her to leave to be with her permanent owner. I cried when she left, but felt so happy that I’d been able to help her. Being toilet trained makes a dog far more appealing to adoptees.  Aries came next, a two-year-old cross-breed. He hated the noise of the bin men, all the crashing around and the flashing lights, but quickly learned to walk on the lead. I began chatting to new people on our walks. Having a dog gave my le structure, some company, and – I know this sounds silly – but I felt myself healing after the split, I got healthier and stronger. I would have felt so isolated in lockdown otherwise. How long you have a dog totally depends on how soon they are re-homed, so it can be anything from a few days to several weeks. Joy and fulfilment I really fell in love with Hermes, my next dog. He was also from the same barn, and terried of everything. He freaked out indoors and would scrabble to escape out of a window, then whimper. I would stand outside and keep an eye on him from the window, gradually building up the time he could be left. It was a complete buzz seeing his behaviour change. It was hard kissing Hermes goodbye, he’d become my buddy, but I know my time with him had changed his le prospects. My fourth dog was an adorable, problem-free Maltese puppy, Bea. I’ve never had one try to bite me. The most damage they’ve caused is chewing a wooden coffee table leg, but I am not precious about these things.  I’m having a few days away now, but I can’t wait to welcome a new dog into my le when I’m back. I bumped into my ex the other day and he remarked how happy I seemed now. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be out walking and meet someone new  But I’m happy being single now, the dogs have brought me more joy and fulfilment than I thought possible. What is dog fostering  ● The Home From Home fostering scheme finds temporary homes for dogs that need a little extra TLC, such as young puppies, older dogs and those who would find the hustle and bustle of kennels stressful. ● Fostering is completely voluntary, and Dogs Trust provides essentials, such as food and bedding, and provides -hour guidance and training advice. ● Adam Clowes, Dogs Trust operations director, says: ‘Being a foster carer gives you all the joy of adopting without the long-term commitment. It’s perfect for dog lovers who aren’t ready to adopt yet. aposJust as importantly, becoming a foster carer means helping fellow dog lovers who have no other choice than to permanently give up their dog. You’ll be giving a dog a loving home when they need it most. Every dog in foster care allows us to take in another dog in need.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"anne diamond winter preparedness covid","story":"NewsopinionAnne Diamond: Winter preparedness in a Covid- year is going to take on a whole new urgencyAs scientists fear second wave of pandemic, planned measures to help NHS cope include  million extra people being offered free flu jab.

And we certainly don’t want to see another heartbreaking run on Brussells sprouts like the one in  due, farmers reported, to a wet windy summer. No, it’s not our yuletide spread that’s under threat this year. It’s whether we’ll be well enough to eat it. “Winter preparedness” is the new Downing Street buzzphrase. It may sound like a chapter from an old-fashioned home economics book that Fanny Cradock wrote in the s, but it’s actually a ­matter of le and death. Winter preparedness could be every bit as vital as pandemic preparedness should have been way back in February and March. That’s when government ­leaders and health officials knew something dangerous was on the horizon but failed to have a plan and faffed about for too long, blithely telling us they were “following the science”. In ordinary winters we know the old and vulnerable ­succumb to seasonal flu. Thousands die even in a good year when flu vaccine targets the right virus. But winter preparedness in a Covid- year is going to take on a whole new ­urgency. Scientists fear there’s going to be a second wave of the deadly pandemic and we are really going to need those Nightingale Hospitals – at a time when the NHS is traditionally under stress. So as part of a series of measures to help the NHS cope with a second wave, it’s been announced that  million extra people will be offered a free flu jab.  Anyone over , anyone ­shielding and children up to the first year of secondary school will be part of the UK’s ­biggest-ever vaccination programme. But anyone who listens to the experts knows there are three stages to the efficacy of vaccines. One is RD – actually formulating the vaccine in the first place. Two is manufacturing enough of it fast. And three is distributing it evenly, quickly and fairly.

Lara Crabb gleefully showed herself defying advice from scientists hoping to avoid Covid- spreading. Crabb is among defiant Brits refusing to follow rules designed to stop the spread of Covid- and save lives. Yesterday new rules came in making it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops, with those refusing to do so facing fines of up to £.Crabb, who has also shared a link to anti-lockdown campaign group Keep Britain Free, wrote on Twitter : Didnapost clap for the NHS once.They are paid to do their job. Havenapost clapped for a Sky Sports cameraman woman either but would prefer to clap for one of them. The shopper, who described herself as anti vaccines shared a video of herself shopping with no mask on. Crabb said she has endured abuse since voicing her opposition to wearing face coverings. Another Brit, tattoo artist Aron Walton, filmed himself walking around a Sainsburyaposs story claiming that face coverings were ineffective. Some companies have called on customers to wear face coverings but said they will not actively enforce the new rules. But John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, called for them to rethink this, saying: I would urge retail outlets to play their part in making the rules crystal clear -you are not wearing a face covering then you are not coming in. Officers will be there to help storesneeded - but only as a last resort, as we simply do not have the resources.  He continued: If youaposre out shopping and you see somebody not wearing a face covering it may be because they have a hidden disability. Donapost jump to conclusions, donapost have a go at them. This is new for us all, itaposs about keeping each other safe. Please be nice! A group led by anti-lockdown campaigner Simon Dolan has raised more than £, to mount a challenge against the UK Government Lockdown. He warned that the lockdown has and will lead to devastating economic impact.  The number of shoppers in England declined by .% yesterday compared to the previous Friday, following a week of relatively steady increases in traffic to stores and supermarkets. Friday marked the first day that shoppers in England had been legally obliged to wear a face covering or risk a fine. Anyone flouting the rules without an exemption risks a £ fine - reduced to £paid quickly.  Data from retail intelligence company Springboard revealed the drop in footfall in England compared to modest growth in shoppers where in the UK where dferent regulations on face coverings are in force. Traffic to shops increased .% in Scotland, % in Northern Ireland and .% in Wales on Friday.

In his early s the graphic ­design boss was enjoying the le of a s yuppie with an impressive house and BMW. He married the love of his le in  and had daughter Shani the following year. But four years later he found Jesus, gave up his possessions and became a friar. His decision destroyed his ­marriage and alienated him from his child, who felt she had been “abandoned for God”. Now, decades later, the pair are reconciled – and Martin, , even ­conducted her church wedding. He said: “There I am, an ­ordained deacon, seeing the most beautul ­person in the world walking down the aisle. It was the most precious moment.” Shani, , said: “It was a very personal service. Dad talked about all we’d been through. “I arranged a dance with him to Bruce Springsteen’s Secret Garden then we danced to Madonna and George Michael.” The most special moment in her le was a far cry from the day when her dad moved out of the family home in York in  after her parents’ marriage hit the rocks.  Drting into a deep depression, Martin experienced an epiphany later that year, despite never having been ­religious before. He said: “I remember seeing a figure of Jesus hanging from the cross, tortured, and connecting with it. “I began studying the Bible and praying.” Two years later he and we Anne orced. Inspired by scriptures he sold his business and gave his money – save for £, – and house to his we and daughter.  He left and ­headed for Scotland to live like a hermit on the Isle of Arran. “It was hard for everyone to understand, me finding Christ and giving up all my money,” he said. “Although I was not living AS a hermit, which is a ­vocation for some Catholics, I lived a hermit-like existence, in solitude. “It was the back of beyond and I had no phone or television. I reconnected with God, meditated and walked in the forest. I supported myself by selling paintings and jewellery at a craft fair.” Every Sunday, Martin would call Shani from a phone box. He said: “It was painful. She didn’t want to have a conversation with me.”  Returning to York in , he joined the Catholic Church, which he could do despite being a ­orcee because his register office marriage was not recognised. Living with his grandma, he ­supported himself with odd jobs but Shani found it hard to accept him.She said: “I kept him at arm’sas I was angry with him. It felt like God had taken him away.” Then, when Shani was , Martin went to Oxford to become a Franciscan friar, taking vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. He said: “After that, she didn’t talk to me properly for years.”  While they spoke on the phone and exchanged occasional letters, Shani was not interested in a full reconciliation. But when she turned  she reached out to him. “He got ­permission to come and live with me for a few weeks,” she said. “Then we got to know each other properly.” After that, Martin and Shani enjoyed nightly phone calls, she even visited the friary where he lived. “I felt at peace there,” she said. “When he was ­showing me around, it helped me to ­understand him.” Shani saw him more often. “I started talking about Dad to my friends,” she said.

Meghan refused to do certain tasks and ordered her staff to do jobs that were not just things she had to do but that she should do.The source told thethat the former Suits actress would fire off emails in the early morning hours and make huge demands of her staff, and employees who worked for Prince Harry expressed relief that they werenapost working for his we. The allegations emerged in that newspaper as the Times published the first excerpts of Finding Freedom, a new book that contains explosive claims about Meghan and Harryaposs departure from the Royal Family.A source told the : “Meghan is clearly someone who knows what she  wants and is very self-assured. But that made her very dficult to work for. At times, she could show extraordinary kindness and be very sweet but at others she was very self-centred and lacking in any self-awareness. She would say: ‘Why do we have to do this ’ or simply: ‘I’m not doing this’. “She didn’t understand that there were not just jobs she had to do but that she should do. She was behaving like a celebrity in firing off early-morning emails and making huge demands of staff.”  During a row over Meghanaposs wedding tiara, Harry is alleged to have told one of the Queenaposs closest aides: “What Meghan wants Meghan gets.The comment is said to have sparked outrage below stairs as staff resented the idea of giving in to the demands of “an actress on acable show” when they had “signed up to serve Queen and country”.A new book on Harry and Meghan has described how relations between the Sussexes and the Cambridges grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking. Finding Freedom, serialised by the Times and the Sunday Times, claims the couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey despite not having seen each other since January. The bookaposs authors, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, who have been accused of being cheerleaders for the Sussexes, said: Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her. Mr Scobie told the Times: To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I donapost think it left a great taste in the coupleaposs mouths. The authors describe a culture of increasing tension between the Sussexes and other members of the royal family. They say the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust, the authors write. A friend of the coupleaposs referred to the old guard as aposthe vipersapos. Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexesapos team as aposthe squeaky third wheelapos of the palace. Harry and Meghan liked being in control of their narrative in the early days of their marriage, the authors say. But being told to operate under Buckingham Palaceaposs umbrella after splitting their household from the Cambridgesapos was a big disappointment to them.  As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghanaposs dficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the royal family, the authors write. The book says the Sussexes even considered breaking protocol by springing a surprise visit on the Queen when they believed they were being blocked from seeing the monarch. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to the book, but he did not deny the content of The Timesaposs extracts. The spokesman said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.

When they arrived, it appeared the room had not been cleaned since the last guests checked out before the shutdown, the Meesons, from Walsall, West Mids., claim.They claim old, burnt chips were still inside the vile oven, the bath was cracked and leaking, and the microwave was rusty and dirty, BirminghamLive reports.The holiday park has faced a number of complaints about cleanliness and food in recent years. The Meesons had booked a three-night stay from July , and arrived at their £ room after queuing in traffic for an hour. But after taking a look round their room and complaining to a manager - allegedly receiving an abrupt response - they decided to leave at pm.Their oldest son Jamie, , his partner and the coupleaposs other child, -year-old Hayden, decided to stay. But Mr and Mrs Meeson claim the trio eventually left and stayed at a BB instead after police and security were called to deal with a raucous family in a neighbouring chalet.

One of the kids went into the bedroom, but then they opened the wardrobe and at the back of the wardrobe there was a used condom. The oven was vile, there were all dried up, burnt chips down the side. The microwave was all rusty and dirty. The bath had a crack in it, it was all leaking. There were poo stains in the toilet.  The Meesons claim they were told the room would be given a deep clean. However, the cleaner struggled to see the problem, they allege. Mrs Meeson, who works as a cleaner, said: They literally just opened it how they shut it, I donapost understand how thataposs even allowed It shouldnapost have been in that state, we understand there was lockdown but the park shouldnapost have been open until it had been deep cleaned. The Meesons still werenapost happy with the state of the room after the deep clean. They claim four other families left after seeing their rooms.

Rebecca Barnes said a brush with giant hogweedaposs poisonous sap left her two kids needing hospital treatment. Son Reggie, seven, and daughter Roma, five, were rushed to Salisbury District Hospital for urgent treatment after touching the plant while playing. If it had gone in their eyes, they would have been blinded for le. A River Trust expert warned It is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most dangerous plant in Britain. Giant hogweed can tower at ft tall like a Trfid, and children are attracted to it because the hollow stems of the plant make ideal peashooters. It produces a toxic sap which reacts with sunlight and burns the skin, causing permanent blisters and scars. It can also even lead to permanent blindness. Rebecca said initially Roma had aposmildapos redness and rash-like symptoms, but after a long day in the sun things got worse. As the day wore on the blisters got bigger and bigger and bigger. The sap removes the natural UV protection of the skin, so what Roma was actually suffering was burns from the sun. Romaaposs parents say the public should be made more aware. Rebecca said Itaposs not commonly warned about which I think it needs to be. On public footpaths there needs to be pictures of it becausethe sap gets into your eyes it can cause permanent blindness.  Roma, who was the worst affected, will need bandages on her arms and legs for a y time. For at least six months, but up to seven years sun protection wonapost be enough. Iaposm just praying that the scarring isnapost left because it can obviously leave really bad scars. One expert, Guy Barter, from the Royal Horticultural Society, said giant hogweedaposs risks are greater this year because the plant is flourishing.  It likes damp soil, it likes riparian areas next to rivers and of course this winter we had an awful lot of rain - one of the wettest winters on record. Rivers were high, that picked up the seeds and fragments of plants and spread them out along water courses. It grows like a Trfid and can tower ft tall. It was innocently shipped into the UK by well-meaning Victorian plant hunters in the th century. Spitting out poisonous sap when touched, it has escaped from country mansion gardens and private collections and is spreading across the countryside.  A map published by Plant Trackers shows it now exists in most parts of the country and its progress seems unstoppable. In Gloucestershire itaposs already been seen sprouting this spring in rural areas including Painswick and Stonehouse. Other aposTrfidsapos have been sighted near Ross-on-Wye on the Herefordshire border and the woods around Ullenwood. Now labelled public enemy number one in the countryside, itaposs a special threat to children. Its stems are hollow, so they try to use the apostubesapos as pretend telescopes or peashooters. There have been several cases in the past of youngsters screaming in pain from the agonising blisters which appear on their skin.  Parents are being warned to tell their children not to touch the plant whose leaves, stems, roots, flowers and seeds all contain the poisonous toxin. In the summer of  horticulturist Dean Simmons was left with le-changing injuries after brushing against one of the plants growing in Taunton, Somerset. Its tentacle-like fronds touched his bare legs and he suffered agonising skin burns that doctors say would take months to heal. Speaking at the time he said I feel so stupid - because of my job, I had knowledge of this plant and was still caught out. I was out fishing and didnapost see it until it was too late - and a day later I was on morphine. The plant, which kills off rival native plants by growing so fast and big that it blots out their sunlight, loves to lurk along rivers and canals to aposambushapos families out for a walk. Dean said in  The burns and pain are pure agony and I canapost walk. I would hate to see a child in my position. The pain is unreal.  In September , Keith Cooper, , was hospitalised by the plantaposs toxic sap after he went to look at a ‘pretty plant’ that his we Maria had seen in the undergrowth. Keith, of Howdon, Tyne and Wear, did not realise they had stumbled across some giant hogweed and doctors warned he would not be able to expose his badly-burnt right leg to sunlight until the year .

The Newfoundland loves water and her owner, Cha Sparks, said Darcy darts straight for the water whenever they go out and about - so she decided it was time for her to have a pool of her own. When Chaaposs stepdad spotted a aposbargainapos £ dog pool online, he snapped it up and explained that it may take a little longer to arrive than usual as it was coming all the way from China. Six weeks later, Cha was left baffled when a tiny parcel arrived at her front door in Shorne, Kent, and had no idea what it could be - until she realised the hilarious mistake. It turns out the dog pool ordered online was no bigger than a water bowl and looked comical next to Darcy, who could wear her new toy as a hat. Lawyer Cha said: Darcy absolutely loves water. Every time we take her to the dog park she gets straight in. So when the weather picked up my stepdad ordered her a pool online. When it was delivered we didnapost know what it was as it was folded up so small. When we realised it was the dog pool we thought it was hysterical. We then put the pool next to Darcy and took a photo.  The -year-old said her stepdad had seen the pool advertised on Facebook with pictures of big dogs getting in and out of it with ease. Despite feeling a little ripped off, the pair found it hysterical and posted photos of a gutted Darcy towering over her new pool on social media, where it quickly went viral. Cha added: We think it may have been a scam, however we were so entertained we didnapost give it much thought.  My stepdad isnapost very technical so he didnapost realise. He hasnapost contacted the company yet, I am going to help him with this in the coming days. We sent photos to our friends, who all thought it was comical. That is when I decided to post it online to a dog group, as I knew they would find it funny too.

Vivian Meneses Figueiredo was not there  years ago when a police firearms team snuffed out her cousin’s le in a flash. But CCTV of the killing and the images of her beloved relative covered in blood on a Tube train are something she can never forget. Met Police mistook innocent Jean Charles de Menezes – Vivian’s flatmate – for a terrorist. As horried passengers looked on at Stockwell Tube station, South London, they showered him with gunfire and rendered him leless on the train floor. The memory of him lying in the morgue – seven bullets to the head – never leaves Vivian. Yet, remarkably, she has finally been able to forgive. It was on July ,  that Brazilian Jean Charles, , died. From that day, Vivian, , was never able to set foot in the flat they shared and for years would cross the road to avoid police. She has since gained British citizenship, has had a daughter and got married – all while missing the cousin she doted on. Speaking exclusively to the Sunday Mirror, Vivian said: “There are things I don’t accept but I don’t want to carry around a lot of hate and be so miserable.  “At the beginning I had bad feeling towards the police, really bad feeling – it was making me ill. “I had to work it out to be able to live in peace. So I don’t want to say ‘I hate all these terrorists or hate all police’, it’s not like that. What police did I think is really wrong and I probably won’t ever understand or forget. “But do I carry this big hate for them in my heart  “No, I worked it out. I can’t bring my cousin back. My pain is my pain. “He is gone and gone for ever.”  Jean Charles, an electrician, died the day after a failed plot by four men to blow up Tube trains and a bus. It was just two weeks after fanatics killed  Londoners in the   terror attacks. Officers were watching flats where Jean Charles and Vivian lived in Tulse Hill. They shared a communal door with an address linked to suspect Hussain Osman. They had been shown a grainy image of Osman and mistook Jean Charles for him. Jean Charles was followed on to a Tube  by police who feared an imminent terror attack and opened fire. The bullets were designed to “petal” – spread on impact – for maximum effect. The Met Police has repeatedly apologised to the victim’s family and gave a settlement payout of about £, in . It went to his parents. Stay-at-home mum Vivian – whose father Darcy is Jean Charles’s uncle – was  at the time. The cousins grew up in Minas Gerais, Brazil.  They went travelling and visited Paris, Dublin and Wales before Vivian moved into Jean Charles’s flat in April . Ironically, her parents thought London was safer than crime-riddled cities like Sao Paulo. Photos taken by Vivian that year show Jean Charles smiling in front of the Arc de Triomphe. Vivian’s last chat with Jean Charles was when she cooked his favourite Mexican chilli, rice and salad two nights before he died. He had met a girl he liked and was chatting about his dream wedding, saying he would like it to be super traditional.  Vivian didn’t see him again as Jean Charles worked long hours. She became worried when he didn’thome after work on Saturday July . A colleague of Jean Charles visited the flat to tell her police had been asking about him. Vivian went to Brixton police station, seeking answers. She was shown a picture of Jean Charles and told she had to go to the morgue to identy him. Vivian sobbed as she gazed at his body, utterly confused by what had happened.  “It was a nightmare. My world just fell apart,” Vivian says. “I was in shock. I didn’t want to believe what was happening. It was terrying.” Vivian, who now lives in Knightsbridge, West London, says Jean Charles’s death shattered her mental health. No police officers faced disciplinary action and Cressida Dick – who oversaw the operation – went on to become the current Met Police Commissioner. In  four men were jailed for le after being found guilty of conspiracy to murder in relation to the bomb plot.  Hussain Osman, , Ramzi Mohammed, , Muktar Said Ibrahim, , and Yassin Omar, , will serve a minimum of  years. At Jean Charles’s inquest, which ended in May , the jury delivered an open verdict. That year, the Met offered an unreserved apology. Vivian ed to London after Jean Charles’s funeral in Brazil. She struggled, initially, to get on the Northern Line and had flashbacks of what his death may have been like. Vivian said: “At the beginning I couldn’t avoid the thought. I wanted to look for other routes but I said no, that’s where I live, I want to face it, that is what it is. “You have to face it and be brave and with time it became a bit easier. “I cannot blame the terrorists. I know they do evil things but they didn’t kill my cousin, the police killed him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey epstein had another royal","story":"NewsJeffrey Epstein had another royal in infamous black book - the Queen’s nephewEXCLUSIVE: The Earl of Snowdon, widely known by his professional name David Linley, was in the paedophile’s list of contacts that includes Donald Trump and ex-US president Bill ClintonShareByPatrick Hill:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video prince-andrew-could-called-give-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news jeffrey-epstein-had-another-royal-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Earl of Snowdon, widely known by his professional name David Linley, was in the paedophile’s list of contacts. Others included some of the world’s most powerful people, including Donald Trump and former US president Bill Clinton. Florida-based Spencer Kuvin, representing several Epstein victims, urged the royal to speak to investigators, alongside his cousin Prince Andrew. There is no suggestion the Earl is accused of any wrongdoing or has any information about Prince Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, who died in jail in , or his socialite pal Ghislaine Maxwell.But Mr Kuvin told the Sunday People: “Anyone with information about Epstein, Maxwell and any of their comings and goings over the past two decades and more should come forward and talk, including Viscount Linley. He added: “I am never surprised at the growing list of people that became Epstein’s unfortunate friends. He worked his way into every part of society, high and low.”  The Earl is known as the royal carpenter due to his high-end furniture business Linley’s. His mother Margaret, the Queen’s sister, died in  and he became the nd Earl of Snowdon after his father died in . The Earl, now set to orce after more than  years of marriage, was picked by his first cousin Prince Charles as No in The Prince’s Foundation. The appointment in  raised eyebrows as he was chosen ahead of William and Harry. A friend said: “David is very, very close to the Queen and Prince Charles. He goes to Sandringham at Christmas and Balmoral in the summer. He is George VI’s grandson and in the inner circle of royals. He is also Mr Non-Grand Royal. He turns up on his cycle in a high-vis jacket and gets mistaken for a warden. He is popular and social.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton rolled out red","story":"NewsKate Middleton rolled out the red carpet for Meghan as friends hit out at bookFriends of the Duchess of Cambridge have struck back at fresh claims in new biography Finding Freedom, that say the royal was unwelcoming towards MeghanShareCommentsByMirror:,  JUL NewsMeghan and Kate at Wimbledon last year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Cambridges hosted at their private home Anmer Hall in Norfolk where she cooked Meghan her favourite vegan dish.

These are among the many bombshell claims in the new book Finding Freedom, which reveals how relations between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and his family became frosty in the months before they quit The Firm. The first extracts from the eagerly-anticipated book are being released this weekend - and it is anticipated the explosive revelations will send relations to a new low. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to the book, but he did not deny the content of the first of three days of extracts published in the Times and Sunday Times. The extracts offer a glimpse into what was going on behind the scenes as it became clear there was serious trouble within the Royal Family before Meghan and Harry announced they would quit le as senior royals in a move dubbed Megxit. Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, who are accused of being cheerleaders for the Sussexes, describe a culture of increasing tension between the couple and other senior royals. Meghan, Harry and one-year-old son Archie are now living in pal Tyler Perryaposs £ million Tuscan-style mansion in Los Angeles after breaking out on their own.  Here are some of the sensational claims revealed in the first extract of the book. Meghan and Harry aposwere jealous of William and Kateapos After being in control of their narrative in the early days of their marriage, the Sussexes became frustrated that the Cambridges got all the best official roles and felt cut adrt from the Royal Family, the book claims. Meghan and Harry were upset they had to take a backseat to other family members, including Harryaposs dad Prince Charles, who were given priority for their own projects. It is said the couple struggled to adjust to le within the monarchyaposs ranks, and felt they werenapost being supported or protected as their popularity soared. They felt they had been patronised by other family and staff\u2028 members for too long. aposOld guard simply didnapost like Meghanapos Harry felt some palace officials simply didnapost like Meghan and would stop at nothing to make her le dficult. He also felt used for their popularity. The book claims Harry and Meghan felt like they didnapost have a choice when they decided to give up their roles and move to the US to do their own thing. Cambridges and Sussexes were aposbarely speakingapos  Finding Freedom claims relations between the Cambridges and Sussexes grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking. Kate purposefully snubbed Meghan and barely acknowledged her as the couples made their final public appearance together at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey in March. They barely spoke despite not having seen each other since January. The book also claims that Kate and Meghan barely said a word to each other at a charity polo match in July , where they were photographed standing next to each other with their children. Meghan apostearfully said she gave up her entire le for royalsapos The Duchess of Sussex tearfully told a friend she had given up her entire le for the Royal Family, it is claimed. She allegedly made the comment in March, around the time of the tumultuous split from the Firm. Meghan is said to have told a pal: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad.” Harry read nasty comments about him online There were suggestions Harry was obsessed with press coverage and online comments about him and his we. The book says he would scroll through news articles on his iPhone and sometimes couldnapost stop himself from reading the comments, no matter how cruel they were. One trollaposs comment, the world would be a better place without Harry and Meghan in it, had more than , likes. Harry is alleged to have said: “It’s a sick part of the society\u2028 we live in today, and no one is doing anything\u2028 about it. Where’s the positivity \u2028 Why is everyone so miserable and angry ”\u2028 Fears Meghan would be more popular than the Queen Senior courtiers, who Princess Diana used to refer to as men in grey suits wanted the popularity of the Sussexes to be reined in, the book alleges. The establishment feared their\u2028 popularity might eclipse that of the royal family, the book says. It also claims senior officials blocked Harry and Meghan from setting up their own inidual household in Windsor. The couple saw themselves as a major draw for the royals but were baffled why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests, it is said. As relations soured, the Sussexes felt there were many officials they couldnapost trust, and suspected other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. A friend referred to the old guards as the vipers. Couple aposupset Queen wouldnapost bend rules for themapos Harry and Meghan grew frustrated after the Queen and Charles refused to bend the rules over Megxit, the book claims. A senior courtier said Harry was sorely mistakenhe thought he would get exactly what he wanted. The source added: The Queen understood the dficulties they\u2028 faced, but the rules don’t bend for anyone. Harry drove the decision to quit royal le In the months leading up to Megxit, many reports claimed that Meghan was to blame for tension within the family. But the book says there were problems between Harry and William long before she arrived on the scene, and Harry was already taking steps to distance himself from royal le. It is said he craved a le away from the media and avoided the pomp as much as he could. The book says: Meghan simply emboldened him to\u2028make the change. “Fundamentally, Harry wanted out,” a\u2028source close to the couple told the authors. Meghan and Harry were apossqueaky third wheelapos A frustrated palace staff member described the Sussexesapos team as the squeaky third wheel of the monarchy. Resolving matters between the households was a struggle because so many staff members were involved, the source claimed. Harry aposdisparaged for being too sensitiveapos The Duke of Sussex is said to have felt unprotected by his family and thought he was being disparaged within the palace for being too\u2028 sensitive and outspoken. Initially, the couple wanted to find a happy place within the monarchy instead of walking away entirely. But as the weeks went on they realised they couldnapost go back to the way things had been at home and decided to step back as senior royals, the book says. aposBiggest argument was about moneyapos  When the Sussexes were negotiating their departure from the family, the biggest argument was about money. An aide joked about Meghan launching a line of beauty products to earn cash. They said they would cut themselves off from the sovereign grant, but doing so wasnapost so easy. A source told the authors: The biggest row was over money, because it always is. It was unclear how the Sussexesapos finances would work once they separated from the royal family, with the book saying courtiers claimed Harryaposs position was completely unrealistic. In their bombshell statement on January , Harry and Meghan announced their intention to work to become financially independent while also fully supporting the Queen. Meghan and Harry aposhurt the Queenapos The Sussexes werenapost entirely free from blame as relations deteriorated. A website designed to clary Harry and Meghanaposs future was deeply upsetting to members of the royal family and hurt the Queen, the book claims. The couple created a lot of ill will in the household and especially in the family through actions including keeping the royals and their own team in the dark about their plans. The Queen was blindsided by the website which laid out the coupleaposs transition to private le. The surprise announcement on January  was followed by a short statement from Buckingham Palace  minutes later. Aides including the Queenaposs private secretary were furious. Coupleaposs aposbig disappointmentapos before quitting Being told to operate under Buckingham Palaceaposs umbrella after splitting their household from the Cambridgesapos was a big disappointment to them. The Sussexes had wanted to set up their own household in Windsor, but the idea was quickly nixed by palace officials. This is said to have fuelled the coupleaposs desire to go out on their own and pursue their own interests. Sussexes considered breaking protocol to see Queen Harry and Meghan are said to have considered the extreme measure of breaking royal protocol and going to see the Queen as tensions grew. The book says Harry spoke to Charles and the Queen about his desire to make changes before he left for Canada for six weeks at the end of last year. It was during that stay on Vancouver Island the couple decided to quit as senior royals, and Harry told his grandmother and father in an email, and then requested a meeting as soon as the Sussexes ed to the UK for a brief visit in January. After Harry was told the Queen wouldnapost be available until the end of January, the Sussexes considered driving straight from the airport to see the monarch. But they decided not to because it would have ruffled feathers and caused problems. aposHard for mixed-race American to join familyapos "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan  harry book six","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry book has  revelations to rock monarchy - with more to comeFrom feuding wives to upsetting the Queen, Finding Freedom is packed full of shocking secrets Kensington Palace would probably prefer to keep under wraps...ShareCommentsByPatrick HillRussell MyersAmy Sharpe:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsNew book Finding Freedom lts the lid on the drama at Kensington Palace and why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle decided to quit Royal le \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the book, which is being serialised by the Times and the Sunday Times, the authors claim the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Other claims include that yhe two couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey in March, despite not having seen each other since January. While the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. Here we reveal the six most bombshell claims that will rock the Royal Family to its core. William  Harry’s fallout Prrince Harry was fed up of playing second fiddle to William and Kate – and felt the pair were given better roles than him and Meghan, the book claims. But a source close to the royals said Prince Charles included both Wills and Harry in his plans for a “slimmed-down monarchy”. They said: “His vision included both his sons. William will always be more important than Harry but that’s a fact only because of birthright.” The book also says William was not impressed when he first heard Harry was stepping down but left it to aides to sort the details. William reportedly told a friend: “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore. We’re separate entities.” Race and the Royal Family Joining the royals was tough for Meghan as a mixed-race American, it is alleged. Author Omid Scobie hints at racist attitudes within the household, saying of Meghan arriving on the scene: “That was going to ruffle feathers.” The book does not accuse the royals of racism, but Mr Scobie told The Times: “There are iniduals who may like to take a look at how they view the world.” Harry and Meghan have been outspoken on the subject of racial injustice, addressing the topic a number of times since George Floyd died during a police arrest in the US in May. This month they called on the UK to confront its colonial past during a video conference with young black leaders from across the British Commonwealth. Harry told them: “There is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past.” Kate  Meghan’s relationship  The Duchesses’ relation-ship never moved past “distant politeness” – and had turned distinctly frosty by this year, the book claims. The strain between Kate and Meghan was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. Harry  Meghan ‘finding freedom’  Harry had long struggled with royal le but wanted to find a “happy place” within the monarchy, the book claims. “It wasn’t just the press or online trolls getting to Harry,” it says. “It was also the institution of the monarchy. “Barely a week went by without internal affairs or matters of private discussions being twisted and leaked.” They wanted to continue due to Harry’s “love and respect for his grandmother,” it adds, but also because Meghan felt she had given up so much “to take her le down a path of service to the monarchy.”  But the couple allegedly felt “blocked” after requesting a meeting with the Queen during a UK visit on January – and it being pushed back to the th.The authors add: “Harry felt he and Meghan had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future.” Royal courtiersapos rage    Senior royal staff feared that Harry and Meghan’s fame would “eclipse that of the Royal Family”, the book claims. Courtiers – described by Princess Diana, below, as “men in grey suits” – reportedly felt the Sussexes must be “reigned in”. The authors write: “As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghan’s dficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the Royal Family.” A friend of the pair referred to the old guard as “vipers”. After Harry and Megan decided to leave the UK, negotiations over logistics and their finances created a “headache for everyone”, one aide reportedly complained. The authors write: “Courtiers viewed Harry’s position as completely unrealistic.” The Queen left ‘blindsided’    The couple’s announcement detailing their departure and launch of their Sussex Royal website left the Queen “devastated”, Finding Freedom says. An insider said: “The element of surprise, the blindsiding of the Queen, for the other principals who are all mindful of this, rightfully, it was deeply upsetting.” It had been agreed the couple and Her Majesty would release a joint statement announcing the decision, but Harry and Meghan broke ranks on January  after their plans were leaked to the media.

Another royal said “she comes with a lot of baggage”.And Harry was further angered by brother William referring to Meg as “this girl”. The revelations, in new book Finding Freedom, came as royal biographer Andrew Morton said Princess Diana would have been “devastated” by the rt between her beloved sons. According to the revelations – on Sky TV ahead of publication in the Sunday Times – sources revealed William had given advice to Harry about his relationship with Meghan. William reportedly said: “Don’t feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.” Harry, , was said to have felt the comments came with a “tone of snobbishness” that was “anathema to his approach to the world”. The book says Meghan was a topic of Palace gossip when she first dated Harry in .One extract says: “One senior royal referred to the American actress as ‘Harry’s showgirl’. Another told an aide, ‘She comes with a lot of baggage’. And a high-ranking courtier was overheard telling a colleague, ‘There’s just something about her I don’t trust’.” The book also refers to Meghan’s relationship with William’s we Kate. It says there were some “awkward moments” but the pair never had a falling out.It says: “Meghan would agree the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harry’s girlfriend. But they were not at war. The bookaposs co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, claim Harry was offended by Williamaposs advice, but according to the pair, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust.  Harryaposs belief that the palace was out to sabotage his relationship was the beginning of the rt with his brother. He is said to have felt unprotected by the institutions around the monarchy, and derided by the old guard for being too sensitive and outspoken. The Duchess of Cambridge apparently did little to bridge the ide and never really got to know Meghan. One source said of Harry: Heaposs extremely protective of Meghan. He understands that a lot of people are against them, and he will do everything he can to keep her safe and away from getting hurt - eventhat means distancing himself from those people.  Another said the coolness between the princes was the reason for Harry and Meghanaposs move to Windsor. He wanted to get away from the goldfish bowl that was Kensington Palace, the said. Everywhere you turn, youaposre surrounded by staff and family. He was at a point in his le where he was working with his brother, doing the foundation with his brother and living by his brother. It was too much.

The authors of Finding Freedom, serialised by The Times and The Sunday Times, claim Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. As well as a number of salacious revelations about the Sussexesapos growing bitterness towards the royal family and the machinery of the monarchy, the book also tries to debunk a few alleged myths. According to the co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, the alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William - and not Meghan and Kate. The press were apparently too quick to blame the Sussexesapos decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses, the authors say, when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. The authors wrote: The truth was that Meghan and Kate just didnapost know each other that well. They claim the duchessesapos relationship had not really progressed from when they had first met, and that Meghan was disappointed by Kateaposs lack of support during her roughest times with the press. But rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaidaposs dress fitting for Princess Charlotte are , the book insists. Reports that Meghanaposs strict demands had left Kate in tears puzzled those who were present.  A source who was there said: Some of the children werenapost co-operating, and there was a lot going on. Everyone tried to help where they could, but itaposs never easy with kids at fittings. There were no tears from anyone. And in the end, the fitting was fine. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room, and there were other people there.

Believed to have been tacitly approved by the couple, it includes revelations about the breakdown of Harry’s relationship with brother William and fallouts between Meghan and Kate. And it claims the pair felt “used for their popularity” by courtiers and “sidelined” by senior royals. The bombshell biography also suggests Harry felt as though he Meghan, , were left “unprotected, alone and disparaged” back within the institution’s walls for being too sensitive and outspoken. It even claims the -year-old Prince “had lost respect for certain family members at points” and that he likened a week of January meetings with senior royals and palace aides “to standing in front of a firing squad” as he tried to negotiate a step-down deal. The US authors of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family say the book was written with the “participation of those closest to Meghan and Harry”, including “inner circle” members Harry and Meghan yesterday claimed they did not contribute to the biography. Their spokesperson said the book was based on “independent reporting” by writers Omid Scobie, royal editor at society magazine Harper’s Bazaar US and journalist Carolyn Durand who spent two decades covering the Royal Family in London. A palace source told us: “The book will probably be a bestseller and make a load of money for the authors – but then what  Harry and Meghan’s reputation will be completely scarred. “It’s hard to be a trailblazeryou’re setting fire to everything around you. It’s asthey are burning bridges with the family.” The biography claims Meghan, , tearfully told a pal earlier this year: “I gave up my entire le for this family, willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are.” Scobie and Durand also describe Harry as “emotional” after being stripped of honorary military appointments.The Prince is also is said to have had “grown frustrated” with some of the “old guard” of Palace staff and the “back seat” they had to take to other family members. The authors wrote: “There were just a handful at the palace they could trust. A friend of the couple referred to the old guard as ‘vipers’. The couple are said to have been left “disappointed” at not being allowed to form their own household team at Frogmore after their  marriage.And the book adds Harry was angered by suggestions Meghan was solely responsible for their decision to quit. An insider told the authors: “The courtiers blame Meghan, and some family do”.But a source close to the couple claimed Harry had always wished to embark on his own path, saying : “Fundamentally, Harry wanted out. Deep down, he was always struggling within that world. She’s opened  the door for him.” The authors also claim Harry believed he had been “blocked” from seeing the Queen after the couple’s decision to step down from royal le.Yet as “devastated” as she was at her grandson leaving formal royal le, Her Majesty is said to have “made it very clear they can come back whenever they want”. The book claims Harry even considered breaking protocol by making an unannounced visit to Sandringham to “plead their case”.He is said to have felt courtiers – described by his late mother as the “men in grey suits” – were intent on “reining in” the couple’s popularity amid fears the public’s affection for them “might eclipse that of the Royal Family itself”.  Our Palace source said: “Many feel the accusations unjust. “Everyone bent over backwards to make sure Harry and Meghan had everything they ever wanted. Time and time again they were offered advice and didn’t take a blind bit of notice.” The source also admitted courtiers are anxious about more revelations ahead of the book’s worldwide publication on August .They have compared it to Andrew Morton’s book about Princess Diana, which he wrote with her help. Extracts in today’s Times also tell how Harry emailed the Queen and Prince Charles to say he and Meghan “had come to the decision to change the way they worked — to step back and spend more time abroad”.The authors claim Harry made repeated requests to his father’s private office to nail down a time in January for the two to meet the Queen then at Sandringham for the Christmas holiday. But the astonished Prince was allegedly told she would not be available until January , leaving him feeling “he was being blocked”. A source in the book adds: “At this point they felt like they had brought up the subject enough times with family members over the past year and they were fed up of not being taken seriously.”Hitting back at the claims, a separate Palace source told us: “One thing which won’t be made clear is how Harry and Meghan were happy to use all the power and privilege at their disposal while secretly planning to leave.“It’s now clear they were using Meghan’s connections in America to set up their new le way beforehand.” Meghan and Harry, who had son Archie in May last year, broke with royal tradition to spend last Christmas in Canada instead of Sandringham."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle says dad has","story":"NewsMeghan Markle says her dad has been fully corrupted but wanted him at her weddingA new biography about Meghan and Prince Harry says the Duchess felt sorry for her estranged father but she blames the media for what happened between themShareCommentsByTrevor Marshallsea:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan Markle and her dad Thomas in happier times \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Meghan felt let down when Thomas Markle lied to her by denying he helped the paparazzi stage photos of him going about his le in a Mexican resort town before the royal wedding, the book Finding Freedom alleges. But both Meghan and Harry were also angry at the media for wearing down Mr Markle for several months until he complied with their requests. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that, according to an unnamed trusted confidant of the duchess, Meghan had said: My dad never sought this out. I really believe that heaposs the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe heaposs been fully corrupted. The book says after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in November, , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials of: I canapost speak out of respect for my family. Meghan and Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately - with encouragement from Meghanaposs elder half-sister Samantha - Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, the book says. Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photos, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The photos were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning £,, and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing % of the proceeds, according to the book which has been serialised this weekend in The Times and The Sunday Times.  A week before the May  royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday tabloid was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged. The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father. Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day. Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family earlier this year. But there were warnings signs of their shock move and the Queen knew something was amiss before Christmas, according to a report this evening.The revelations come on the eve of a bombshell biography of the couple called aposFinding Freedomapos which is set to be serialized this weekend. A new report claims that in November  Her Majesty had not heard whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their newborn son Archie would be spending Christmas at Sandringham and she decided to give them a call at Frogmore Cottage.The decision broke with tradition as ordinarily it is for the younger Royals to phone “Granny”.But the -year-old wanted to get to the bottom of what was happening after hearing tales of apostantrumsapos ever since the couple got married at Windsor Castle in , reports The .  However, the Queen did not get the answer she wanted and instead days later she learnt the couple were not coming for Christmas but on a six-week sabbatical to Canada to “work out their future”.It was during this time they reportedly plotted their way out of the Royal Family and within weeks, on January , it was announced that Harry and Meghan would be taking a new direction as royals. While their decision had been made, Harry reportedly wanted to speak with The Queen and Prince Charles - his grandmother and father - on the phone but officials persudaded him instead to write to them.  Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, are expected to reveal - Harry’s anger predominantly lay with what his mother famously described as the palace’s “men in grey suits” - rather than his own royal relatives. A source said: The palace approach would always be - how did we do it last time  He wanted to do things dferently and I think Meghan was the catalyst for him but also gave him the confidence which he lacked to change things.” "},{"url":null,"title":"really damaging things said before","story":"NewsWilliams cutting comment before Harry married Meghan that made brother go ballisticExtracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, are expected to reveal that tensions were high before the couple walked down the aisle in May ShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video meghan-markle-says-vulnerable-struggled-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news really-damaging-things-said-before-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were wed in May  in a high-profile ceremony watched by millions. Although there had been tribulations with Meghanaposs father in the days before it appeared as though Meghanaposs relationship with the royal family was rock solid. Prince Charles walked her part way down the aisle in lieu of her unwell dad.

And it is at its worst not in the inner cities but in ­seaside towns hit hard by austerity. Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria tops a list of places where kids have been admitted to AE with drink-related problems in the past three years. Six more coastal towns make the top ten, including South Tyneside, Torbay in Devon, and Scarborough in North Yorks. In Barrow,  under s had hospital treatment for booze, equivalent to  ­admissions per , kids, Public Health England stats show. Experts fear declining resorts and port communities have been left behind and children are drinking from an early age. Although Leeds had the most admissions over the three years, with , that was equal to  per ,. Inner cities feature at the lower end of the table. Tommy Sharp, now , from Barrow, was  when he began swigging vodka at house parties. He got hooked on booze which cost him his relationship, ­business and liberty. Now he is getting his le back on track and is warning others boozing is not a “bit of fun”. Tommy would go out in big groups and drink at weekend house parties when parents were away. He said: “A bottle of lime Smirnoff and lemonade split between four of you can get you frizzled, and it did. “We were on the vodka, ­others were drinking White Lightning and Frosty Jacks. I never ended up in the ­hospital myself but a friend did.” Tommy said: “Once I turned  it was horrendous, every single night. That led to stronger stuff.” He worked as a doorman in the town and started taking “plant food” as a legal high. In the following years he lost his partner and young daughter, his business and home. He also had four spells in prison, all for crimes he put down to his excessive drinking. He said: “I had set up an online marketing company with my dad and brother. We had  ­members of staff. I should have been at my pinnacle but my drinking was out of hand.  “My partner was worried about my drinking. It got so bad she stopped me seeing my kid. My dad and brother had no other option but to kick me out of the business. It was the ­darkest time of my le.” Five months ago a pal put Tommy in contact with The Well, a support group for ­recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. He hasn’t touched a drop since. Tommy said: “I was blaming ­others but it was me who pushed every person away from me. My addiction was a disease. “Mine is an extreme case but it should serve as a ­warning. You think it’s a bit of fun, you don’t think what you are doing is wrong, but look where it got me. “It’s taken me nine years to get my le back on track.” Barrow used to have a huge steelworks and a thriving shipbuilding industry but much of it has ­disappeared in the past  years. The lowest AE admission rates were in the London boroughs of Brent, Waltham Forest, Southwark and Westminster and Newham. Ged Pickersgill, project manager at The Well, was ­surprised that Barrow topped the league. He said: “I see all the good work being done, by the council, the police and the ­voluntary sector. I don’t see the town having a major problem.  “It has its pockets of ­deprivation but it also has very affluent ­areas. There are some major employers here and a very skilled workforce. There is a strong local community.” Cath Corkill, from Drop Zone, a youth project in the town said: “There’s not a lot  to do. Then there’s peer ­pressure. They meet their mates and get into a ­ ­pattern.

Jed Foster was arrested and charged with the murder of the police officer in August, although the case was dropped after it emerged he had an aposelectronic alibiapos. PC Harper was dragged for more than a mile along country lanes in August last year while responding to a quad bike theft in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire. His ankles became tangled in a tow rope attached to a getaway car. Driver Henry Long, , and passengers Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of murder at the Old Bailey yesterday. The prosecution of Mr Foster was dropped in September as there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, with prosecutors moving to terminate the case against him. A court order was initially made banning any reporting of the reason that the case against Mr Foster was dropped, but it has since been lted. He has now spoken out about how being charged and held in prison for a month aposbrokeapos him and tore his family apart. Mr Foster told the BBC that his family was bombarded with hate mail, with people encouraging him to hang himself. He added: I could prove even then I was not involved, but the police did not seem to be interested. I was arrested and then charged with murder and spent several weeks in prison accused of an offence that I did not commit.  I knew I was innocent, but I was worried that I would be wrongly convicted, and that for the murder of a police officer I could die in prison. Mr Foster said police appeared to be searching for someone to blame for the death of their colleague and did not seem to carehe was actually involved. The -year-old has now launched legal action against Thames Valley Police. Thames Valley Police said it had received notication of a potential compensation claim from Mr Fosteraposs solicitor and declined to comment further. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay told the Old Bailey in September that Mr Foster, who was  at the time, had been arrested near where the car used to drag PC Harper was found.  He said that highly incriminating texts from Mr Fosteraposs phone had talked about being in a car with helicopters overhead. But when quizzed by police he said it was stupid sick banter to wind his sister up, the Evening Standard reports. Mr Polnay added: The defendant [Mr Foster] was arrested in vicinity of the car used to drag PC Harper. His telephone was seized, he declined to provide the pin code, police managed to gain access to his telephone and discovered that messages were highly incriminating. Mr Polnay said that Mr Foster had been charged by the Crown Prosecution Servicebefore a full file of evidence was available under the threshold test that there had been reasonable grounds to suspect the person has committed the offence.  But following further investigation, it was discovered that Mr Fosteraposs phone had not been at the scene of the theft or the area where PC Harper was killed, he said. Mr Polnay added: The telephone was not at the scene of the theft and the area where PC Harper was killed. There was an electronic alibi from the phone being used where.

That is how many have benefited from the Children’s Funeral Fund since it was launched after a campaign backed by the Sunday Mirror. MP Carolyn Harris, who lost eight-year-old son Martin in a car crash and led the calls for the fund, said: “Knowing other families have been spared worry at the most dficult time of their lives has made our pain more bearable. “I am immensely proud that the fund was established.” Now the Co-op, whose Funeralcare arm plays a key role, has launched a new drive to increase awareness of the Government grants. Under the scheme, the Ministry of Justice pays funeral or cremation fees and expenses plus £ towards a coffin. It is paid regardless of family income. The fund was pushed through by Theresa May near the end of her premiership and created last July.David Collingwood, Co-op Director of Funerals, wants it extended to include costs such as cortege cars. He said: “It’s a fund you hope nobody will ever have to access.” Cash eased my grief  Mum Shirley Whitworth was devastated when son Adam, , vanished while swimming with pals in the River Irwell. But Shirley, , of Kearsley, Gtr Manchester, was spared even more distress by the Children’s Funeral Fund. She said: “I was numb with shock and grief but it came as a relief to receive some support.

Her feet were so tiny they were each only the size of a wedding ring. No wonder then that she was given just a five per cent chance of even surviving a day. But she emerged fighting, and kept on overcoming what seemed like insurmountable challenges. By the time she was four months old she had undergone three critical surgeries – including a major heart operation – and  emergency blood transfusions. But after a harrowing  days in intensive care, her proud parents, Cally and Luke Worsdell, were finally able to take their little fighter home. Now, pictured smiling happily, little Rosalie is a thriving, healthy -month-old. Cally says: “We feel like the luckiest parents in the world. We spent so many sleepless nights tossing and turning, it was agony. But we never gave up and neither did she.” Cally, , was terried when she discovered she was going into labour at just  weeks and one day pregnant. She was suffering from placental abruption – a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall. “Everything was running smoothly and there weren’t any problems at the -week scan, but three weeks later I felt a bit strange and my stomach hurt,” recalls Cally. “I work in a hospital so I asked a nurse on the maternity ward to check my blood pressure and she said, ‘do not move, you are in labour’. I couldn’t believe it. “Luke rushed to the hospital and spent the next four days by my side. I had to lie on a tilt with my head down and bottom up in a bid to keep her in. “The doctors prepared us for the worst and warned us babies aren’t viable until  weeks so they wouldn’t be obliged to save hershe didn’t breathe on her own. “She was  hours short of being viable, but thankfully she made three little cries when she was born. It was a huge relief to hear her, but doctors told us there was only a five per cent chance she’d make it through her first day.” Although the odds were against her, Cally and Luke say they had a “gut feeling” she would pull through. Rosalie was blue-lighted from Medway Maritime Hospital to Kings College NICU, put on a ventilator and fed through a tube. First-time mum Cally, from Maidstone, Kent, says: “It was so hard hearing our baby might die. It’s dficult because nobody prepares you for what can go wrong – we thought there was a high chance of her being disabled with a poor quality of le.  “The first nine days were promising as she was fine, but then the start of many problems began. At  days old, she needed emergency surgery and a temporary stoma bag – her perforated bowel was causing her to balloon as the milk was leaking into her abdomen. “She was in a critical condition and the surgery was performed on the ward as she wasn’t stable enough to be moved into theatre. It was the longest six hours of our lives. “The doctors said one in three babies with necrotising enterocolitis dies on the operating table, which was horrible to hear. “Thankfully, she recovered well from the surgery and that is when we realised she was a little fighter. “But that didn’t stop every day from being doom and gloom because she was so vulnerable.”  At nine weeks old, medics discovered an open duct in Rosalie’s tiny heart. This is quite common for premature babies and can sometimes be fixed with paracetamol. But Rosalie needed keyhole surgery. Cally says: “I spent so many nights tossing and turning as I was worried about what may happen next with our baby. It was agony.” During her stay in NICU at King’s, Rosalie had  blood transfusions. Then at three months old, she had injections in her eyes as she developed retinopathy of prematurity – a disease that could have potentially left her blind. She underwent another surgery at four months old to reverse her stoma.  Cally says: “As the weeks passed, we became quite resilient as she always bounced back. After her third and final surgery, her lungs collapsed, which was another devastating setback. “It is crazy to think she had been through so much before her due date last August . But she never gave up – and neither did we.” After four weeks and five days, Cally was able to cuddle her baby for the first time. She says: “I sat with Rosalie for  hours a day so it was really nice to finally hold her, but the risk overruled the reward. “It was scary as there were so many wires attached to her – I was petried in case something went wrong.” Luke, , who is a director of a cleaning services company, says: “It is very rare for a baby to be born so early and there is no reason behind it.  “It was horrible hearing negative stuff all the time as we were given the worst-case scenarios, butthere was no chance of survival, then they wouldn’t have done the surgeries. We weren’t going to give her a middle name but when she was taken to NICU, I said to Cally, ‘all we can do is hope’ – and thataposs how we got her middle name. “It was a very dficult situation and we can’t praise the charities enough – Rosalie would not be here todayshe didn’t have the donated incubator to lie in. “Cally wouldn’t have been able to stay by her side every day while I worked as we live over an hour away.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk karens petition respect name","story":"NewsUK Karens petition for respect as name is used to depict rude and racist womenIts a right Karen carry-on as Karens have had enough with their name being used as a slur on social media, with JK Rowling and Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding Jess Phillips being given the labelShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video bbc-podcast-dicusses-how-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The moniker has gone viral on social media, being used to depict a passive-aggressive, judgmental woman who is rude, quick to complain, often racist – and usually white and middle-aged. It surged during Black Lives Matter protests, when videos were circulated of white women – labelled Karens – clashing with demonstrators. But angry Karens are now demanding “respect” in a series of online petitions. Karen Button, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said she has “had enough”. She said being associated with women “who are racist or not law abiding is upsetting and unfair”. Another Karen wrote: “We are not Medusa-like beings or fire-breathing dragons. And WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT RACIST!!” She added she is not privileged and does not have a bad hairdo – other traits mocked in internet memes.  A third Karen wrote: “My parents gave me this name out of love. I refuse to change it because of cruel people on the internet.” The name consistently ranked in the top  in England and Wales between  and . But it has lost popularity in recent years, with just  UK babies named Karen in . Harry Potter author JK Rowling was labelled “a Karen” after saying young gay people were being “shunted” towards hormones and transgender surgery. Some argue negative use of Karen is steeped in sexism, as it demonises opinionated and assertive women. Days before Jess Phillips was appointed Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, more than , people liked a tweet calling her Shadow Karen Minister. Some online posts refer to the Ku Klux Karen, linking the name to the white supremacy group.

The biscuit, made in a factory in South Wales for the last  years, is doing so well manufacturers Burton Biscuits are releasing more flavours. And Wagon Wheels aren’t the only biccie to roll off the shelves. All those months of being stuck at home has seen biscuit sales rocket by £million from March to mid-July, retail figures reveal. And with all those extra treats being gobbled up, it’s no surprise tea and coffee sales have been boiling over, too. We spent an extra £million on the beverages while cafes were closed – with one of the biggest producers of tea in the UK, Yorkshire Tea, now making nine billion teabags a year. Another typically British staple that’s doing sizzlingly well is the ever-reliable banger.  British sausage producer Heck has seen a hike in sales and leads the way with  per cent of the premium sausage market in UK supermarkets.As a result they are investing £million to expand their factory in Bedale, North Yorkshire and are planning a vertical farm on the site to create a “closed loop” system and cut down on food miles.

Since  the charity Medical Detection Dogs has trained more than  animals to detect everything from cancer and diabetes to panic attacks and night terrors. They are even learning how to spot Covid-. Here four families explain why they really could not live without their four-legged friends.DOG ONE: ALLY Cuddly Ally is amazing even by the high standards of Medical Detection Dogs. The chocolate labrador is the charity’s only pooch to save two siblings’ lives many times a day. On top of that she has also given their exhausted parents vital respite. Kia, at aged two, was diagnosed with a condition that caused her blood sugar to fall dangerously low. This meant mum Debbie Mace and dad Andrew had to monitor it   with heel prick tests every  minutes. Very soon they were worn out. But then Ally came into their lives. The medical alert assistance dog was trained over many months to pick up low blood sugar in Kia, alerting her parents when she was hypoglycemic with a quiet grunt. When Kia’s little brother Nial was also diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a le-limiting genetic condition, Ally automatically began doing the same for him. Retail worker Debbie, , from Worksop, Notts, said her children are tube-fed   and non-verbal without any prospect of a cure. The MDS also causes non-diabetic hypoglycemia, which current medical equipment is too slow to detect before the children slip into coma and suffer brain damage.  Debbie said: “Ally detects when either of their blood sugar levels are starting to fall, sits by the one affected. “When I approach with the IV machine, Ally gets super-excited, knowing she’s going to get a rather lovely treat – a bit of ham or chicken. Essentially Ally’s quite a greedy dog, but in a perfect, cuddly way. “Ally’s basically given us our lives back. Our family will never be able to repay our debt to Medical Detection Dogs.”DOG TWO: ZIGGY Serving as a combat medic in the Royal Army Medical Corps left Richard Mearns mentally scarred. He completed a tour of Iraq in  where he saw harrowing atrocities. In , after suffering ongoing night terrors and daily anxiety, he was formally diagnosed with post- traumatic stress disorder. He was given coping strategies, including cognitive behavioural therapy but he said he was able toonly after he got his assistance dog Ziggy in . Richard, , from Croydon, South London, said: “I had that PTSD diagnosis and some tools to help me cope but I obviously wasn’t well. “I got to the point where I planned my own suicide using the bayonet my grandfather had during the Second World War – it was only the thought of my -month-old daughter which stopped me.  “I got a job as a dog handler with a security company and realised how dogs gave me a sense of comfort and purpose. I researched online and realised how therapeutic dogs can be for mental health issues such as PTSD, and was lucky enough to receive a dog with the right temperament for me to train.” Ziggy was socialised for six months before coming to live with Richard, where he and a training specialist honed his skills. NowRichard is ever anxious in crowded places Ziggy will rest his chin on his owner to calm and ground him. He said: “If I’m in a meeting and about to have a panic attack he’ll mouth at my hand, making me get up and leave the room before things escalate. But the biggest thing he does is wake me at nightI’m about to have – or just starting – a night terror. “I go from being in the baking heat of Iraq to seeing this dog looking into my eyes. Before I was having three or four night flashbacks a week, now it’s just one or two a month. I’m getting proper sleep and can hold down a job I love as a civil servant.” DOG THREE: ROOConnie Schofield was bitten by a tick and became seriously ill in her final year at university.She was later diagnosed with an adrenal gland insufficiency. Her body was not making enough of the vital hormone cortisol.  She had to take cortisol tablets to stop her body shutting down. Now Connie, , of Oxford, has Hungarian vizsla Roo in her le. She said: “Up to six times a day he’ll come and paw memy cortisol levels are dropping. He’s a miracle on four legs. “I’m no longer bedbound.

The house, which is located in Australia, has a hefty .- million, £.-£. million price guide - and itaposs clear why, when you see whataposs on offer. The house features three luxe bathrooms, treetop views from the first floor, a large garden with a pool and a built-in BBQ to entertain guests. Although the exterior of the house screams modern, beach chic and is enough to catch a buyers attention, what lies at the back of the property is enough to take your breathe away. Buyers will have a rare chance to own the sand at your own private beach. Yes, you heard correctly. For the first time in generations, there is a chance for buyers to get their hands on a slice of the stunning private waterfront paradise. McEwing and Partners director Dean Phillips said it was dficult to find private beaches for sale anywhere in Australia.He told realestate.au : A chance to own the sand on a private beach is the reality of what’s on title here.It’s a very unique offering with gorgeous views and absolutely no foot traffic nearby.  The property is set in an exclusive street shared by only three other residents - making it perfect for a couple or family who want their privacy. Mr Phillips explained that all of the houses on the streets have been held by families for generations, with some being passed down for up to  years.  But this house was built  years ago by a star-studded duo - a high-end builder and his stylist we. And both the exterior and interior of the property, which has been completed to the highest standard, reflects that.  On the ground floor, you can find a beach-chic style kitchen with waterfall bench tops and spacious living room with fire place, and upstairs there is a theatre and games room. To the rear of the property - other than the private beach - is a large garden with a self-cleaning pool, an outside terrace with BBQ and an outdoor shower.

Jasmine Nur, , was watching Zobiyah, four, enjoy a packet of Nutella  Go, as they were doing their food shopping. The stay-at-home mum, from Auckland, New Zealand, didn’t think much of it and continued browsing the supermarket. However, while she was wiping her daughteraposs face she noticed she was breaking out in hives which she said appeared in places that were in direct contact with the Nutella chocolate. Jasmine panicked and immediately rushed Zobiyah to hospital where a nurse gave her a fast dose of antihistamine to reduce the swelling. However, the youngster would go on to suffer allergic reactions from other foods and steroid creams, as well as rashes and eczema. The eczema became so severe, strangers made cruel assumptions about Jasmineaposs parenting. Recalling the incident that happened in , Jasmine said: We were out grocery shopping and she happened to have found a Nutella  Go packet. “She opened it up and immediately started munching away. I didnapost think anything of it. I continued doing my shopping and got back to the car. “As I started wiping her face, thataposs when I noticed she started to get hives whilst I was wiping away. They were literally appearing in all the places that the Nutella touched. Zobiyah was kept under observation at hospital for a number of hours before being given her prescription then sent home. But a week later, Zobiyah started developing severe rashes around her eyes and hands. Jasmine didn’t know what to do and after a few days, Zobiyah started to get feverish and her rashes became infected. Thinking she had chicken pox, Jasmine gave her Pamol but her husband, felt certain that it was something , so they took her to the hospital again. The nurse then diagnosed her daughter with eczema and prescribed a steroid cream called Hydrocortisone. Over the years, Jasmine noticed her eczema got worse and began to spread all over her body. In April, she did some research on the usage of steroid creams and came across topical steroid withdrawal, also known as red burning skin and steroid dermatitis. Symptoms of this reaction include redness of skin, a burning sensation, and itchiness. Jasmine then decided to completely stop her daughter from taking the medication and has now let her skin heal naturally. Throughout her journey Jasmine admits that strangers who see Zobiyah judge her and even wrongly accuse her of neglecting her daughter, despite her desperate attempts to heal her. Jasmine is speaking out now as her goal is to raise awareness of the dangers of steroid creams and the importance of letting skin heal naturally. Jasmine says that whilst the purpose of the steroid was to alleviate her symptoms and eventually get rid of her eczema, it did the complete opposite and her condition became worse. Even though Zobiyah is no longer using the steroid cream, her skin is still quite severe and she is unable to go swimming, as she reacts badly to chlorine. As well as being allergic to Nutella chocolate, she is also allergic to tomatoes, citrus foods and fruits and also spicy food. “[I felt] Heartbroken [at the time of her diagnosis]. It happened suddenly, Jasmine said. So I wasnapost able to process the fact that she had gotten it so suddenly,” she said.  “I was upset because she never had it. Her skin was so clear when she was a baby. Sadly, when it started, everyone who was used to seeing her clear skin always questioned, ‘How did it happen ’ and I felt like I was being judged because to some, it seemed like I neglected my child. “Apart from the fact that she canapost go swimming due to her skin reacting to chlorine, I try and let her do what every child her age does.

For months officials in countries such as China, Japan and Hong Kong have been busy dousing public places in hypochlorous acid. The substance, which is known as HCIO, is formed by dissolving chlorine in water, and is dozens of times more effective at killing viruses than bleach. It is also incredibly cheap to produce. Despite having helpful cleansing properties, the acid is weak enough to pose little threat to humans and is used to keep swimming pool water clean. Earlier this week the UK government approved trials which will see HCIO sprayed in public places. The fact the use of the liquid has taken so long to be used in the UK, when its effectiveness where has been apparent for months, has been questioned by experts. Dr Darren Reynolds, professor in Health and Environment at the University of the West of England, told MailOnline: We should have used HOCl from the very start. It would have made a huge dference – but it’s still not too late. HOCI has been used to great effect in South Korea and has been praised as a key reason why the country has kept its coronavirus cases low.Not only is the liquid sprayed on the streets, people entering and exiting certain public places have been doused in a mist of HOCI. Workers heading home at the end of shts have been walking through arches which blast hypochlorous acid from the sides. The practice is not unheard of in the UK, where dental workers use hand held spray guns to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces.  Rugby and football clubs may soon be getting in on the act. Trimite, a company which distributes fogging tunnels, says it is in discussions with some clubs to have their products installed.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

North Berwick offers a unique environment and itrsquos a fine balancing act accommodating the ied needs of visitors, residents and businesses with necessary public health measures at this time and wersquoll continue to engage with key stakeholders regarding Spaces for People.\"North Berwick Coastal ward councillor Jeremy Findlay welcomed the news.He said: \"I am very pleased that the council has listened to the views of residents of North Berwick and Elcho Green is not going to be turned into a car park.\"I hope the council, residents of North Berwick and councillors all now get together and come up with a solution that keeps everyone happy.\"Earlier, East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill had said that he and his SNP colleagues on East Lothian Council would be \"making our opposition clear\" to the plans.The councils decision to put the Elcho Green plans on hold comes two weeks after the local authoritys u-turn on Spaces for People plans in East Lothians other towns, after they were faced with a backlash from concerned traders and residents.Meanwhile, last week the council also put controversial plans for a transport hub at Whittingehame Drive in Haddington on hold, saying it instead wanted to focus on supporting the local economy in recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"hidden-disability-face-mask-exemptions-card----can-get-one","story":"The First Minister has repeatedly stressed avoid the avoidance of self-policing of the coverings -

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders,

Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed

winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre

received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the

authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure

Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media.

Thus the certainty with which Ms Stephenson presents her ldquocase simply has no basis in reality beyond a convenient conjecture.Her musings about membership of the EU, likewise present another unwarranted certainty. It is certainly the case that member countries have their own currencies , but the fact is that the EU has never faced a situation like Scotlandrsquos and thus any certainty about what it might do is unwarranted. In any event, evenMs Stephenson is correct that the EU would refuse an independent Scotland membershipit lacked its own currency, she writes asone is in the EU or not, when the fact is that, routinely the EU enters into association agreements with applicant states prior to full membership. These, while not according voting rights, could give Scotland much of what we want from membership, such as single market access, participation in EU schemes and freedom of movement.Of course,one starts from the proposition that Scotland should continue to be part of the UK, then any forecast of an independent future will be extremely negative. Naturally, we are all entitled to our point of view, but presenting mere conjectures as facts is disingenuous. Ironically Ms Stephenson considers giving  impressions ldquoworse than irresponsible. She might want to look at her own contributions before being critical in this way of others.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.JILL Stephenson is correct, the British nationalist parties vetoed a currency union between Scotland and rUK, though it could only have worked short term in any case.After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, the establishment of new currencies was achieved quickly and pain-free. So Scotland should establish a new currency as quickly as possible, and as Scotland runs a substantial trade surplus we have a good basis from which to start. I prefer the ldquoNorway Option for Scotland, butwe did join the EU, the euro would be fine an optimal currency in a huge trade block on our doorstep.Would an independent Scotland have a per capita share of the substantial UK assets   If not we would then have no debt to repay . Butwe had Clark Crossrsquos trial run , we would spend our revenue for best Scottish bang-for-our-buck, not paying for expenditure outside Scotland ldquoon our behalf. We would not expect to pay any part of, or incur debt on behalf of, HS or renewing Trident, or the rebuilding of Westminster Palace, or any of the myriad of expenditures south of our border, any more than we would pay for spending programmes in, say, France.Of course, under Mr Crossrsquos suggestion, Scotland would have no way to access the many opportunities that a normal self-governing country has, but it would part the veil of dependency and let us see the most excellent vistarsquos that lie beyond. We only have to vote Yes.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I VERY much doubtClark Crosss proposal that Scotland should be given a two year \"trial run\" at independence would result in the waning of the desire for self-government as he confidently predicts. So far,  countries have gained independence from the UK, none of them has asked to come back and many of them celebrate the day that British colonial powers departed. As for Scotlands sustainability, other nations of similar size in population to Scotland are managing their independence very well, such as Denmark, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, and Finland and there are plenty of other countries with far smaller populations than Scotland, such as Iceland, who are also thriving with self-respect, self-determination and self-government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon often quips that Boris Johnsons a recruiting sergeant for Scottish independence.

Knowledge of geology has never been more important, for understanding and mitigating future climate change and helping Scotland meet the  net-zero emissions target. So it is concerning that the number of applications for geoscience degrees at Scottish universities is in sharp decline.The loss of Higher Geology is undoubtedly a factor, but there are many opportunities within the Curriculum for Excellence and other Highers such as Environmental Science and Geography for pupils to learn how the planet works, and the many dferent ways in which geology and geological processes impact on modern le in Scotland. Organisations such as the Geobus at St Andrews University and Scotlandrsquos Geoparks are doing excellent work in taking geology into the classroom, and placing it in the context of sustainable development. The recent launch of a new charity, the Scottish Geology Trust, recognises the need to support these existing initiatives, and for wider promotion of the importance of geology to Scotland.Angus Miller, Secretary, Scottish Geology Trust, Edinburgh.VIDEO GAGAROBERT McNeils piece on video gaming was embarrassing : there have been holograms with more substance.First, video gaming being for \"loners\": right, so all those adverts with families playing Nintendo Switch games togetherjust passed him by, as did World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Rocket League and the umpteen other cooperation games where you have no chance of advancement or success without teamwork.Next, \"all the games had themes of violence and fighting\".

The picture is by no means as clear cut as Mr McKay attempts to present it. While he is obviously familiar with the titles of some of Dickensrsquos novels, he ought to read Martin Chuzzlewit, in which Dickensrsquos horror of slavery is abundantly clear. He should also read the chapter on slavery in American Notes, which shows Dickensrsquos utter revulsion at the manner in which slave owners treated their slaves.As to the assertion that ldquoDickens didnrsquot have much time for Catholics I would suggest that he read Pictures from Italy, where he will learn that Dickens took issue with aspects of ritual, but not with Catholics as people. He might try Barnaby Rudge, which, as he may know, is an account of the ldquoNo Popery Gordon riots of . It is quite clear throughout that Dickensrsquos sympathies lie wholly with the victims of the disorders. I would venture to suggest that the above assertion is purely mischievous.Dr GM Armitage, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-hume-not-deserve-vitriol","story":"His work is also held in high regard abroad.

In the eighteenth century, the island was home to around fty distillers with each farm on the island operating at least one still producing whisky.This began to decline as tighter regulations from both the estate and the government were introduced. Although a large number of islanders were still making whisky illegally, this industry ceased completely in the nineteenth century.#Tiree Whisky Company Ltd was established by locals Alain Campbell and Ian Smith with the aim of reviving the spirit industry on an island with a rich heritage in the tradition.Local production of Tyree Gin began in February  and, once again, the island was home to an operational distillery - the first in  years.Hebridean Pink Gin is distilled with juniper, raspberries and sweet peels.

When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT.

A total of  Scottish universities are expected to report budget deficits in the   academic year.The SPICe research indicated that as the new academic year approaches in September, ldquothe sector will face new and considerable financial challenges, adding to existing pressures.It adds: ldquoA fall in international student numbers is expected to be one of the main drivers behind the fall in income. This is of particular concern given tuition fees make up the largest proportion of sector income at  per cent and within that, international student fees make up  per cent of tuition fee income .ldquoHowever, the latest UCAS applicant figures up to June  show a  per cent rise in international applicants to Scottish universities and final entrant figures will not be known until the new academic year starts in September. \"It is therefore dficult to know at this stage how much income will be lost.:Coronavirus: Fears universities could be mergedthey dont embrace new normalScottish universities have an income of almost pound billion a year - with around half from the Scottish and UK Governments. Around pound billion is tallied up in fees from non-EU students and from other parts of the UK.Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said: \"The report is absolutely right to say that Scottish universities face a considerable financial challenge as a result of Covid-. Even the most optimistic estimate puts losses at over pound million in the next academic year so the stakes are very high indeed.\"The report rightly highlights that tuition fees, and particularly fees from international students, are the largest source of income for universities and recognises that a fall, of any size, in the number of students coming to Scotland will have a serious impact on university finances.He added: ldquoWersquore months into this crisis but the reality is that universities wonrsquot know the impact on demand until students turn up ndash or donrsquot. Recent applicant data has been a cause for cautious optimism within the sector, in that applications are better than originally feared, when it comes to international students these figures are partial and only indicative.Universities have been propped up by pound million of Scottish Government funding for research, while the UK Government announced a UK-wide pound million research and innovation pot of cash, alongside grant funding and low interest loans.The Scottish Government has also announced that free tuition fees for non-UK EU students will be ended after the   academic year ndash with Universities Minister Richard Lochhead stressing that the estimated pound million that would have funded new EU students studying in Scotland will instead be used to fund places for Scottish students.Mr Sim added: ldquoWersquore grateful for the support packages already offered by the Scottish and UK Governments which will go some way to protect university research and innovation. That support is positive recognition that research and innovation will have a key role in the recovery.ldquoHowever, the pandemic has also been hugely disruptive to the many sources of income that underpin teaching in our universities.ldquoItrsquos that teaching which contributes the skills and knowledge needed for the post-pandemic economy so wersquore concerned that this remains on the agenda and we move into next academic year ndash which is when the financial pressures will be felt most acutely by universities.Some Scottish universities are more reliant than others on international students as a key part of their business model.

So wersquore delighted that this work is progressing at the Scottish Parliament and we will get the powers we need to protect homes and communities.\"But politicians have warned that the plans will not go far enough to halt the impact the industry is reportedly having on communities.Scottish Greens housing spokesperson, Andy Wightman, has led calls for greater regulation of short term lets.He said: ldquoThe Covid crisis has really shone a light the impact of unlawful short term lets, especially where they occur in shared buildings. Any licensing scheme needs to be robust and recognise the impact this poorly regulated market has had on housing provision, as well as the impact these properties have on the surrounding community.ldquoThe Scottish Government proposals must go further. For example, itrsquos clear that no licenses should be issued unless proper planning consent is in place. Each successful application is another home taken out of use, so councils must have the ability to reject applications based on the impact on their jurisdiction.Labour local government spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, added: ldquoI welcome the fact that ministers have listened to concerns about the potential delay to the introduction of new licensing powers for short term lets to local authorities and have resumed work on their proposals.ldquoThe key issue is that the control areas which local councils will have the power to establish will deliver effective regulation and accountability.\"ldquoWe have an urgent shortage of housing in Edinburgh so I will be keen to see the details proposed by ministers to deliver the taxation promised to ensure ldquoan appropriate contribution to local communities and support local services given the massive pressure council finances are currently facing due to years of underfunding.Before the pandemic, a new study revealed that almost one in five homes on Skye is listed on Airbnb.But tourism leaders on the island have warned that any draconian rules could hit businesses as it attempts to recover from the Covid- crisis.A spokesman for SkyeConnect said: ldquoIt is hard to project ahead to this time next year but we would like to think the Scottish Government would recognise the strain that has been placed on the tourism industry this year and not add an additional administrative burden for next season.ldquoShort-term lettings are a signicant part of the tourism economy on Skye and we recognise there are some issues which will need to be addressed.

ondevolved and reserved responsibilities.Gray,who is on the Scottish Greens policy committee, said conversion therapy is \"putting someone through a process that would erase their LGBT identity\".He pointed to moves to ban it in Canada, where officials have defined it as seeking \"to change an inidualrsquos sexual orientation to heterosexual, to repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviours, or to change an inidualrsquos gender identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth\".The Canadian legislation, which was introduced earlier this year, proposes five new criminal offences related to conversion therapy.These include causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy,causing a person to undergo it against their will and profiting from or advertising conversion therapy.The Holyrood petitioners insist the practice has \"damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and adults and continues to do so\".They quoted a report from the charity Stonewall, which found  per cent of health and care staff had witnessed colleagues expressing the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people can be ldquocured of their sexual orientation.They also referenced a survey by theOzanne Foundation, which works withreligious organisations to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender.This found .% of respondents had ldquobeen advised to consider attempts to change their sexual orientationand just over one in sevenhad ldquovoluntarily considered it.The petitioners said: \"Concerningly, .% of LGBT+ respondents had been forced to go through attempts to change their sexual orientation.\"Almost two-thirds, .%, had \"suffered from mental health issues\" as a result of the conversion therapy, including nearly a third who said they had attempted suicide.The Holyrood petition notes: \"These responses clearly show that there is a signicant public health case for banning conversion therapy.\"The experiences of those who were put through this practice show that enforcing this ban should fall under criminal law.\"Both of these areas fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament.\"It said the UK Government has yet to act despite committing to end the practice years ago.It added: \"Given this information, it is clear that conversion therapy is a risk to public health, especially the mental health of vulnerable young adults and children.\"There is broad support for its criminalisation by those who have been subjected to it, and, as healthcare and criminal justice matter, we believe it to be within the scope of the Scottish Governmentrsquos powers to ensure this practice is brought to an end.\"Gray raised concerns the UK plans will be kicked into the long grass.The -year-old said: \"I think it should fall under criminal law, and that is something that is shared by people who have undergone it.\"People who have been through conversion therapy overwhelmingly support it being banned, and I think half of them support it being an area for criminal law.\"I think they are the people who should be listened to on this.\"People who have been subjected to conversion therapy should be the people we listen to most.\"I think it should come down under criminal law, and I think the justication for that partly includes it being a public health issue.\"He said it is an issue that should gain \"universal support\" from Scotlands political parties.Jordan Daly, co-founder of Time for Inclusive Education , a charity working to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools, is one of those backing the petition.He said: ldquoConversion or reparative therapies should have been outlawed a long time ago, and practices which ly claim to change, cure or repair an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have been shown time and again to be emotionally and psychologically traumatic on those who have experienced and survived such programs.\"He said practices which rely on \"using emotionally exploitative tactics to encourage feelings of shame and repression in iniduals are active in Scotland right now\".He added: \"We support this petition and the efforts of campaigners to continue raising awareness about the existence of dangerous and shameful practices in our country.\"Scotland has an opportunity to lead the UK here, and ensure that no other LGBT person, young or old, experiences this ndash ministers and parliamentarians should not delay in taking it.SNP equalities minister Christina McKelvie said: ldquoWe do not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy.\"It is unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland.\"We fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, and are engaging with them as they develop proposals.ldquoThe legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session is currently fully committed.\"We are continuing to engage with officials in the UK Government on their thinking as it develops, and this will include consideration of devolved and reserved responsibilities as they relate to this practice."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-records-27-new-cases-covid-19","story":"A total of , people have

Halax, an architect of appeasement, wanted to ensure peace between Nazi Germany and Britain. One of his first tasks after the Berlin trip was to contact the publishers of the Evening Standard about the problematic matter of a cartoonist called David Low.Throughout the s, Low had lampooned Hitler in the pages of the British press. Halax told the Standard: ldquoYou cannot imagine the frenzy these cartoons cause. As soon as a copy of the Evening Standard arrives, it is pounced on for Lowrsquos cartoons, andit is of Hitler, as it usually is, telephones buzz, tempers rise, fevers mount, and the whole government system of Germany is in uproar.Nobody at the paper would rein in Low, so it fell to Halax to intercede personally. He took Low to lunch and laid his cards on the table. Low listened and replied: ldquoDo I understand you to say that you would find it easier to promote peacemy cartoons did not irritate the Nazi leaders personally Halax said yes. Low later explained: ldquoOf course, he was the foreign secretary hellip So I said, lsquoVery well, I donrsquot want to be responsible for a world warrsquo.In his own words, Low ldquoslowed down a bit. That didnrsquot last long, though. No cartoonist could resist satirising Hitler. Kicking the living hell out of power is part of the job description, after all.Soon Low would go on to draw his masterpiece, ldquoRendezvous, which satirised the grotesquely cynical peace deal between Hitler and Stalin ndash the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact that helped pave the path to war. In the cartoon, Hitler and Stalin are shown courteously meeting each other across a dead body. Hitler doffs his cap and says charmingly, ldquoThe scum of the earth, I believe . Stalin replies, with equal grace, ldquoThe bloody assassin of the workers, I presume .Low understood exactly the power of his pen. He once said: ldquoNo dictator is inconvenienced or even displeased by cartoons showing his terrible person stalking through blood and mud. That is the kind of idea about himself that the power-seeking world-beater would want to propagate. It not only feeds his vanity, but unfortunately it shows profitable s in an awed world. What he does not want to get around is the idea that he is an ass, which is really damaging. And there, in one historical vignette, the power of the political cartoon is neatly summed up.Bye bye BellTherersquos been much worry over the future of satire in Britain and the rest of the Western world of late, as so-called cancel culture wends its way through all avenues of the media from film to print. A short while ago, it emerged thatnewspaper was not to renew the contract of its cartoonist Steve Bell. The move came not long after the departure of a senior editor at another bastion of the so-called liberal press, The New York Times. James Bennet had published a piece by a republican senator calling for military force to put down violent protests. It caused outrage. He resigned. A high-profile columnist with the paper then also resigned. Bari Weiss claimed the paper was effectively being edited by Twitterrsquos ldquowoke brigade.Steve Bellrsquos cartooning is brutal, hersquos cruel. Depending on your political point of view, hersquos a comic genius one day, an utter villain the next. His withering caricatures can define a politician and overshadow their career. Bellrsquos portrayal of John Major wearing his Y-fronts over his trousers summed up the mediocrity of the man as Prime Minister. Hersquos drawn David Cameron as a human condom, and George Osborne as an SM gimp. His portrayal of Alex Salmond as a Saltire-faced, tartan oaf riled nationalists during the  referendum. Likewise, his cartoon of Margaret Thatcher, after her death, sliding into hell and asking ldquowhy is this pit still open  outraged Conservatives.Deliberately upsetting people, using nasty stereotypes, punching below the belt ndash when it comes to dealing with power Bell, like most great cartoonists, is happy to use any tactic. However, hersquos also faced opprobrium over some of his cartoons such as one showing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu holding Tony Blair like a glove puppet. The cartoon was seen as playing with anti-Semitic tropes. Recently his caricature of Home Secretary Priti Patel also got him in serious trouble. He drew Patel quite literally as a fat cow, complete with a ring in her nose. As Patel is of Hindu origin, and the cow scared in Hinduism, he brought fury down upon himself.Soon, amid newspaper layoffs, it emerged that his contract was scheduled not to be renewed. The Jewish Chronicle reported that the moves were ldquosaid to be unrelated to the latest round of redundancies. In June , Bell clashed with rsquos top executives when he complained that he felt ldquounfairly traduced and censored after the paper wouldnrsquot run a cartoon showing a Palestinian burning in a fireplace while Netanyahu and Theresa May sit talking. Bell said editor Katharine Viner did ldquonot really have an argument for spiking his drawing.A few days ago, Bell himself tweeted that his departure was nothing to do with Patel, but rather job cuts at the paper. However, his loss has prompted many in the media to speculate that hersquos another scalp for cancel culture.Wicked clownsIf the political cartoonist has an historical ancestor, itrsquos the court jester. In the medieval court, the jester could get away with anything. The jester could mock royalty, insult palace favourites, and point out the failings of everyone from bishops to potentates. Sometimes, jesters lost their heads, but mostly their patrons welcomed their caustic comedy. It reminded the powerful that they were human and could make stupid mistakes just like the rest of us.Of course, throughout the history of cartooning, not all artists have worked for the greater good or held power to account. Some have acted in bad faith and given succour to dictators like the cartoonists for Nazi newspapers such as Der Sturmer which drew Jews as devils and snakes.The most important issue for any political cartoon is this: what direction itrsquos punching. Is it punching up ndash at the powerful, greedy and dangerous  Or punching down at the weak  If we agree that punching up is the right thing to do ndash then is any tactic fair game  Can stereotypes be used  Until not so long ago, we expected cartoonists to deploy any trick in the book as long as they hit their mark ndash and most importantly made us laugh and think. Now, times are changing. Will that lessen the power of satire at a time when we need it most ndash in an era of populism, hate mobs, and unaccountable power and wealth  The bottom-line question for today is this: can a cartoon really workit is so sanitised that it upsets absolutely nobody The art of offenceIn his excellent book, The Art Of Controversy: Political Cartoons And Their Enduring Power, the American journalist Victor Navasky tells a story which sums up the impossibility of ever finding a cartoon which both hits its mark and offends nobody.Navasky was editing the US magazine The Nation when cartoonist David Levine brought him a drawing of Henry Kissinger ndash the former US secretary of state, seen by many on the left as a warmonger. The cartoon, ldquoScrewing the World, depicted the body of a woman with a head like a globe of the world lying on a bed, her fingers clutching the sheets. On top of her, his body just covered by a Stars and Stripes blanket, is Kissinger, his face contorted with wolfish pleasure. For some, the image absolutely expresses Kissingerrsquos treatment of the world. For others, and in this case many of the Nationrsquos staff, it was sexist and unacceptable.Navasky was collared by his team and asked: ldquoWhy isnrsquot he doing it to a Third World male Good question. But, of course,Kissinger had been shown raping an African man, itrsquos pretty obvious where the anger would come from regarding that reworked cartoon.A history of mischief and sufferingCartoons have been about since Egypt in BC ndash and theyrsquore always grotesque, cruel and offensive. Asking for a cartoonist not to cause offence is like asking a bird not to fly ndash itrsquos innate.Despite ancient caricaturists leaving scratchings in stone mocking almighty leaders like the Pharaoh Akhenaten, the political cartoon is really a creature of the modern age, finding its feet in the s with the English artists William Hogarth and James Gillray. Hogarth satirised society. He was a moralist who tried to expose the failings of the people ndash both rich and poor ndash in works like A Harlotrsquos Progress, A Rakersquos Progress and Gin Lane, a vision of a barbarous drunken London where alcohol is more important than the lives of children.Gillray had two main targets: the excesses of the French Revolution, and the greed of the British ruling class. In his cartoon The Plumb Pudding in Danger he shows the British Prime Minister William Pitt carving up the world with Napoleon. In other European countries at the time, such mockery could have ended with the artist on the gallows. Gillrayrsquos cartoon A Voluptuary Under the Horrors of Digestion portrays a fat, greedy, spoilt Prince Regent, who would go on to be George IV. When Gillray felt the press was too grovelling towards the Duchess of York he drew the cartoon The Duchessrsquos Little Shoes Yielding to the Magnitude of the Dukersquos Foot ndash which effectively showed the aristocratic pair having sex.By the early th century, cartoons were a staple of every newspaper in the democratic world. The cartoon was there to both reflect the politics of the paper and its readers, and to challenge their beliefs. Readers expected their daily cartoon to cause offence ndash either to them or others. And matters effectively stayed like that for the next century ndash although of course the cartoon went underground behind the Iron Curtain as it satirised the absurdities of Soviet le.Perhaps, the greatest practitioner of the modern cartoon is Ralph Steadman. Now aged , Steadman skewered the powerful from the late-s onwards. For instance, in his inimitable surreal, ink-splattered style he nailed the fear brought about by the rise of the former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan to the US presidency.In Reaganrsquos Latest Close-Up, the President looms over Lady Liberty, holding her in a movie star embrace, while dressed as Dracula, his teeth sharp and ready to bite.But cartooning never comes without its cost. In , the Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali ndash who lambasted both Israel and the PLO ndash was murdered on his way to work. In , the Sri Lankan cartoonist Jfry Yoonoos was beaten and stabbed. In , Yemenrsquos Saleh Ali was arrested after he published a cartoon showing a Yemeni man being arrested as one policeman declared ldquoDemocracy is what I say. In Cameroon, Belarus, Iran, and Syria, cartoonists have been subjected to violence, censorship and persecution.Some have said that the clash between cartooning and Islam represents the ultimate expression of cancel culture ndash the act of murdering someone because they caused you offence in art form.In , Denmarkrsquos Jyllands-Posten newspaper published cartoons mocking Islam. Many depicted Mohammed and were seen by Muslims as blasphemous. Death threats were made, cartoonists went into hiding, demonstrations began around the world. By , an estimated  people had been killed as a result of protests and anger.Some years later, in , the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo, published a caricature of Mohammed on its front cover. Its offices were firebombed. In , the magazine published more cartoons deemed offensive to Islam. In January , Islamist terrorists attacked the magazinersquos office. Twelve people died, including cartoonists Cabu and Charb.In the immediate wake of the attack, the West embraced the slogan ldquoJe Suis Charlie as an expression of solidarity with artists murdered simply for daring to draw what they thought. However, quickly, that slogan began to stale for some.There are many who would now no longer stand with Charlie. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties went into victim-blaming mode. ldquoKilling in response to insult, no matter how gross, must be unequivocally condemned. That is why what happened in Paris cannot be tolerated. But neither should we tolerate the kind of intolerance that provoked this violent reaction, said its president Bill Donohue. He was not the only such voice.In this era of social media and political extremism, when offence-taking is as ubiquitous as sand on a beach, cartoonists find themselves in the crosshairs more than ever before in the Western world.When it comes to free speech, cartoons are often ugly speech. But thatrsquos the point ndash theyrsquore meant to offend. Andugly, offensive speech isnrsquot defended, what happens to the concept of free speech  A silent world without offence really would be no laughing matter."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-distant-relatives-frasers-perhaps-scotlands-unfortunate-family","story":"Her house is Beaufort Castle, which she bought together with the surrounding acres in .

In the run-up to hostilities I was in Baghdad when the ldquododgy dossier was published in the British Parliament, allegedly naming the sites of chemical weaponsrsquo production, and going to them with British journalists and TV crews and finding nothing because there was nothing to find.Nonetheless the war proceeded.

These costs may amount to several pounds per attendee, an additional burden that will be impossible for nearly all venues in the sector to absorb.ldquoTherefore, it may be necessary to establish a subsidy for social measures, recognising venues can only operate at -% capacity at two metres distancing and -% at just one metre.Music venues in particular will struggle to make enough money to be viable with any sort of social distancing being required.Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, said: ldquoThe issue of the additional cost per attendee is certainly a concern and needs addressing.ldquoWe would highlight that at one metre, social distancing grass-roots music venues that are able to open, which is approximately one third of the spaces, can operate at an average % capacity.

Theatre buildings are designed on that premise.ldquoTo have performers socially distant would demand creation from scratch of an entirely new repertoire of work right across all performance genres.She added: ldquoFor obvious reasons large gatherings were first to close down, in the same vein we anticipate theatres to be the last to open up again.ldquoFrom having spoken to our network of venue operators across the country, the general consensus, at this point in time, is that March or April  is the most likely date for the theatre industry to restart.ldquoMargins for Capital Theatres, as a large-scale commercial operator, are tight.

The campaign encourages parents to make use of Parent Club, a website packed full of inspiration for what to do.According to the government, any form of play should be encouraged as it can be beneficial to their child’s mental and physical wellbeing.Minister for Children and Young People, Maree Todd, said: “As lockdown restrictions ease, there will be more opportunities for children to get outside and play safely with other children, which should improve wellbeing for children of all ages. The last few months have been an extremely challenging time for children and families and it’s important for parents to acknowledge the pressure they’re under and make time for themselves for their own mental wellbeing.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions. In the meantime she is planning a busy year of events – both ‘virtual’ and ‘physical’ - so that members can continue to give Service while enjoying Friendship. Inner Wheel is an international women’s organisation with over  members in over  countries. It is one of the largest women’s service voluntary organisations in the world.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Yesterday it repeated its position that it would not ulge specic details about cluster outbreaks. There have been  clusters here since the end of May.Sean McKeever, from Unite, which is not the Ballymena#s site recognised trade union but does have members there, said the PHA should implement testing of Moy Park employees for a -day period. We cover the rest of the Moy Park sites and my concern would be the health and safety of all workers on that site, he told the Belfast .I think that every worker should be tested on site over the next  days to make sure it is eradicated.Moy Park has said that it is facilitating testing employees and their households at local test centres.Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of health committee, said it highlighted the need for greater preventative measures for the food manufacturing sector, adding Stormont must show more forthright action.We have seen instances where in the UK and Ireland of tens of cases being linked to inidual meat factories, and literally thousands of confirmed cases were linked to a single plant in Gutersloh in Germany, she said.It is completely obvious that meat factories represent a serious risk.This outbreak suggests that not enough has been done by the relevant ministers to ensure staff safely in meat factories.Belfast Most ReadIRA bomber released under peace deal deported from United States The Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom CastleCoronavirus: Travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from Spain to quarantine for  daysCoronavirus: Michelle O’Neill faces up to wearing a mask while out shoppingVideo: Man charged after crash involving allegedly stolen car,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both apps were designed by Co Waterford company NearForm.Speaking to the Belfast , Stephen Shaw from Big Motive, the company that designed the app, explained that there is a real concern amongst those involved in its development that the general public may not be aware just how useful the contact tracing service could be.You#re talking about avoiding potential future lockdowns, he stated. All of the code, information and everything about the app will be open sourced and public.Read More Pub worker blames coronavirus visor for fall down stairs and is suing Dublin barAnyone that#s worried about it tracking them will be able to access everything about the app and see and check that it#s not doing anything untoward.The Information Commissioner#s Office has been through everything. The higher echelons of the UK Government has scrutinised all elements of it too.People can be genuinely confident that it#s not doing anything dodgy.The app is compatible with the contact tracing service available in the Republic of Ireland and is expected to work with the app being created by the NHS in Great Britain.Mr Shaw explained that this is due to a federated server which is currently being developed for the app.This server will also allow the app to work with other European countries who have a tracing service in the same format, something Mr Shaw called a world first.When asked why Northern Ireland will be the first country in the United Kingdom to launch the app, Mr Shaw praised the work of the Department of Health#sChief Digital Information Officer, Dan West, and the app#s product manager, Dr Eddie O#Neill.Dan West is leading the project and he has been super dynamic and extremely good at bringing together all dferent aspects like the DoH and the Public Health Agency, he said.Along with Dr Eddie O#Neill, the pair of them seem to have a great handle on the subtleties of what technology should be used. The two of them have been instrumental.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island.Mr Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the inability of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other. In the letter, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing serious impediments in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country.Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for  days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within  hours of entering Northern Ireland.He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.

ICE remains committed to removing dangerous foreign nationals from the US, even those who may have managed to evade immigration law for a y period of time.The statement added: ICE is focused on removing public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens and gang members, as well as iniduals who have violated our nation#s immigration laws and those convicted of terrorist activities, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges.Belfast Most ReadThe Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom CastleIRA bomber released under peace deal deported from United States Coronavirus: Travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from Spain to quarantine for  daysVideo: Man charged after crash involving allegedly stolen carCoronavirus: Michelle O’Neill faces up to wearing a mask while out shopping,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Alliance and Green parties also back the proposal, but DUP MLA Christopher Stalford says it could have disastrous repercussions for the area.The initiative would see restaurants and bars expand outdoors in a European cafe culture system. It would help those businesses struggling to remain viable in light of social distancing guidelines.However, other local businesses say that closing the Ormeau Road at weekends could decimate their trade, and some residents have expressed concerns about potential street drunkenness, litter and parking.Under the original proposals much of the Ormeau Road would be shut to traffic every weekend in summer. Following a consultation exercise, that plan has been reduced to one weekend, and to one Saturday and one Sunday before autumn. The #Open Ormeau# idea originated with Ciaran Fox, a director at the Royal Society of Architects.Mr Stalford said: Open Ormeau is a well-intentioned but ill-conceived idea. The main beneficiaries will be pubs and restaurants who do not make up the majority of businesses on the road. Other businesses are dead against it. Those who do the majority of their trade at the weekend will be hurt.If the Ormeau Road is closed, cars will go down the Ravenhill, which is already very busy so it has implications for residents there.Fergal McAdam, owner of homeware store Neptune, said that  of  business owners he had spoken to opposed the plan.It will kill businesses a mile north and a mile south, he said. The Ormeau Road is an arterial route. When you close the blood supply to an artery, you kill the limb.While such a proposal may bring benefits to the hospitality industry, it did not work in a mixed retail area, he added.Michael Goggin, owner of Michel#s Fruit, said: I#ve put my heart and soul into building my business here for  years and this plan will lose me customers and will effectively help the big supermarkets. The Ormeau Road works perfectly as it is. This will lead to drinking on the street and no social distancing.The name #Open Ormeau# is wrong. It#s effectively about closing and restricting things.But Paul Smyth of Ballynafeigh Community Development Association said there was strong support for Open Ormeau. There is a lot of positivity about it. Almost , people took part in our online survey and two-thirds of them backed the proposal, he said.We revised our plans to take account of those who had concerns, particularly businesses. We hope the new plans allay some fears and bring more people behind the initiative. This event is not about street drinking. It is about opening up the amount of space given to pedestrians.Kinsale has done it, Malahide has done it. We want the place to be like a Parisian street where people move around safely, enjoy each other#s company and support local businesses.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown said: This is a community-driven initiative to benefit the area from a bunch of erse residents. It#s a grassroots movement.It#s aimed at reducing traffic and supporting local businesses. I understand that some are for and some against. Consultation and engagement are essential. Nothing is being imposed. This is a conversation we are having. Nobody wants to go into this with bad blood and we are hoping for common ground.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final.

Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued.

Back then, three Kevin Hinphey goals helped them to a - to - win over Lavey,  months after the Erins Own men beat them in the final to end their five-in-a-row hopes. In recent seasons, Hinphey has helped bring through a batch of underage that is feeding into the senior ranks. Former sharpshooter Geoffrey McGonigle is back for a third season as senior boss. Ronan McCloskey remains on the management team, where they are joined by Ryan ONeill who has coached Derry Us to back to back Celtic Challenge titles. googletag.cmd.push “We are the same as every other team, we had a pre-season done the that was kicked into touch, so you were basically starting from scratch,” ONeill pointed out. From last season, they have lost Corey OReilly who has moved to Canada, but many of their young guns are a year older. Padraig OKane scored a goal in last years win over Ballinascreen after being sprung from the bench. Sean and Conor Kelly join their older brother Paddy in the side. Brothers Richie and John Mullan, Odhraacuten McKeever and Tiarnaacuten McHugh have transformed into regulars. “There are a few boys pushing andCassidy has got himself cemented into the team after his first year last year. The county scene will have helped him and you have Darragh McGilligan coming in off the back of the Celtic Challenge and trying to push on,” ONeill added. googletag.cmd.push The Lynchs are assessing Mark Craigs Osteitis pubis injury, which has shown a bit of progress in recent weeks. There is also a doubt over Liam Oacuteg Hinphey, who would bring a wealth of experience to their defence, especiallyCraig fails to make it for the opening games. “We are putting no pressure on anybody,” ONeill added, while acknowledging the uncertainly surrounding the Covid- pandemic. Aiming their sights at Slaughtneil is for another day. For now it is about getting it back to a final. “It is like every year and all we can do is prepare for that first game against Swatragh and once that it out of the way, we will start pushing on for what we are looking for,” ONeill stressed. “Ideally, the goal will be to be in the county final and challenging whoever comes through the other side of the draw and I would be . percent sure it will be Slaughtneil.” For now, it is about finding a balance. Mark Craig is no longer part of Stephen ONeills football  and will be able to focus on his recovery. “It is a tight schedule for dual players and we have just been reasonable with them. If a man has trained or played a match, we need to ensure they rest,” Ryan ONeill points out. “We just cant send men to the slaughter. Our footballers will be doing their thing and we will be doing ours, it just about being sensible with the lads.” Swatragh are under the management of Declan McGuckin this season, after Eamonn Hasson stepped down to work commitments and has brought Seamus Bradley with him to the management team. The  champions have not reported any retirements since last season, but could be without regular full-back Malachaiacute Oacute hAgaacutein due to family commitments. “With the times that is in it, you cant be too forceful. He will be a massive loss, but thankfully Patrick Turner is back out again,” McGuckin pointed out. “Going by a lot of clubs, numbers are away back up again. We have  to , so things are very good so far. Its unbelievable what a pandemic can do to people and they realise it is good to get playing sport a day or two a week.” Swatragh took two games, including a run out against Cloughmills to get geared up for the championship with an eye on qualying for the senior semi-finals. “Banagher will be a big game for us. The Dungiven game wont define our year. We have the Coleraine game and then it is a winner takes all game with Banagher to get to the semi-final of the championship. If not, that junior championship becomes very competitive, which is good. At least there is competitive hurling. VERDICT: Kevin Lynchs RELATEDBanagher to open against Coleraine.

We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along.

I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk.

He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself.

He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

Much better first to upgrade the A east of Stranraer. Above is a part of the road that was upgraded to bypass the village of Dunragit, but the overwhelming bulk of the -mile road to England is single carriageway, in which traffic can get stuck behind tractorsIt was mid - financial slump, and all sorts of businesses were struggling. Private transport services were being cut.My concern was that the PO fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan, which had just begun for the  summer season, might not survive.It needed support, I wrote. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Sure enough, within years the fast ferry was withdrawn .Axing the Larne-Cairnryan fast boat was a sad milestone in the history of movement on these islands.It was the fastest passenger sea link that has ever existed between Ireland and Great Britain, making the journey in an hour. Even the Belfast-Stranraer Seacat express of the s took  minutes.Travel does not always get faster as history progresses. After the Roman empire collapsed, roads in Europe decayed.When Concorde stopped flying in , the public could no longer make transatlantic crossings on passenger planes in just four hours. And since PO ceased running the fast ferry, it has not been possible to cross the Irish Sea or North Channel in one hour on any scheduled, car-carrying vessel. It might never be possible again.This is all the more disappointing given that there is now dual carriageway or motorway the whole distance from Belfast to Larne.The road was upgraded because it forms part of European E route, from Larne to Rosslare. In fact, most of the road between those two ports is now motorway or high quality dual. Yet the ports themselves have lost key ferry services.This is all relevant now because Boris Johnson has approved a feasibility study into his idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland.The idea has many critics, who describe it as a fantasy, yet engineers have said it can be built.But last year there was surprise, even scoffing, when I predicted on a radio discussion show that it would not happen for  years at the very earliest.Some people alive today might see such a structure, but that is mainly because children in  might live into the  century.There are longer bridges in the world than the  miles from Donaghadee to Portpatrick but none passes over a , foot trench.So it would be the most impressive bridge in the world. If any country can build it, the UK, which was once an infrastructure pioneer, and which is the world’s sixth richest nation, can.The problem is that traffic between NI and Scotland is minuscule by international standards.In summer  I passed through the Channel Tunnel, months after it opened, and remember the passenger excitement as our train went from Kent countryside into the tunnel, then emerged into French daylight. That massive triumph of engineering was the culmination of  years of plans for a physical link between England and France.It also connected two cities of almost  million people each, London-Paris, on one of the world’s busiest corridors. NI-Scotland is nowhere near such numbers.A bridge would be doing well to get , vehicles a day paying £ each per crossing, and even then the £+ million annual revenue might only cover the immense security and upkeep costs, let alone giveon the multi billion pound outlay cost.The short-term feasibility of a bridge is akin to unrealistic calls for high speed rail from Belfast to Londonderry, cities of , and , respectively.Not even France, with the best rail infrastructure in the world, has high speed link between two far bigger cities that I have often visited, Bordeaux-Toulouse, which are a mere  miles apart with a combined population of  million.It is unfair to dismiss a bridge to Scotland as a fantasy, better to label it as a distant dream.It cannot be, as Mr Johnson hopes, a boost to the Union because we can’t be sure of the exact constitutional make-up of these islands many decades into the future.As a letter writer says opposite , there are less costly infrastructure projects we need to do first such as improve the road from Stranrarer Cairnryan toM English border.Even that is a hugely expensive project for a road with low traffic levels. But parts of it, such a busier -mile section east of Dumfries, could plausibly be dualled.The value of such an upgrade is evident in an alternative road route to England, the A from Holyhead to the Welsh mainland. I have driven Belfast-London many times since the s and have seen how the best route has changed from being via Stranraer to via Holyhead.This is due to there now being a motorway to Dublin, including a tunnel that goes direct to the port. Then there is dual carriageway or motorway in Wales, so you no longer get stuck behind tractors in Anglesey, as you still do in Galloway.Theof a one-hour fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan and the upgrade of much of the A would radically improve our links to Scotland and be many, many times cheaper than a bridge.Mr Johnson must know that the Union faces real political threats. One of the dangers right now is the rise in Scottish nationalism.In Northern Ireland, unionists face structural disadvantages.For example, mandatory coalition at Stormont facilitates republicans who want NI to fail. Politicians who are less hostile to the status quo tend to want to maintain their seats and livelihoods. Naturally they are inclined to appease the radicals.London should also try to balance a situation in which Dublin officials echo nationalist demands while the UK keeps sending us uninformed secretaries of state, who are influenced by an NIO that is, at best, neutral on unionism.These are urgent problems for the Union. Vague support for a possible future bridge is irrelevant to those challenges.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Letter: Scottish and UK governments have failed to upgrade the roads from Cairnyan——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...We are now seeing the value of an official opposition, financed and incentivised out of self-interest to probe what the government is doing.In the absence of an opposition, and with less than % of MLAs from parties not in government, the Assembly has rows of overwhelmingly obedient servants of their parties who vote as they are directed by their leaders, with scant evidence of questioning legislation what many of them must by now realise is far more signicant than is claimed.The bill involves complex legal and constitutional issues. But, contrary to Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill’s claims that it merely “claries” the law, several respected lawyers have said what even to a non-lawyer seems clear – this would make major alterations to ministerial power. In simple terms, the bill makes two key changes. Firstly, it gives the Infrastructure Minister complete autonomy to take the biggest planning decisions regardless of the Executive’s views on such a decision, it could do nothing to intervene. Senior solicitor Maria O’Loan from Belfast law firm Tughans has highlighted that this fundamentally alters the Belfast Agreement, putting planning decisions – “no matter how controversial or signicant, and regardless of how many other departments that decision would affect” – entirely outside its carefully constructed cross-community architecture.In a society where almost any decision can be perceived to have a green or orange tinge, this sht – especially under any future planning minister more tribally partisan than the incumbent, Nichola Mallon – could precipitate dficulty. Yet, with MLAs just days away from completing legislative scrutiny of the bill, that aspect of the change has not even been mentioned in Stormont.Secondly, the bill would weaken the changes secured by the DUP at St Andrews in  by undermining that agreement’s curtailment of inidual ministers’ powers.It is that change – and the fact that Mrs Foster appears ignorant that it is even happening – which has so alarmed Richard Bullick, the man who was the key backroom strategist for the DUP for most of the time from  to .A trained lawyer who was central to how St Andrews was crafted, Mr Bullick was the DUP’s key internal legal adviser on carefully-selected judicial reviews in the years after St Andrews which the DUP used to clary in case law that the Executive had to agree signicant, controversial or cross-cutting decisions.Given those years of work to construct a framework aimed at preventing any repeat of Martin McGuinness’s unilateral  decision to abolish the Eleven Plus, he has expressed bewildered dismay at how that is being casually discarded.Indeed, the First Minister who is proposing that the DUP’s governmental philosophy of two decades be altered is the same Arlene Foster whose own lawyer made arguments in court on her behalf for wide collective responsibility – but is now ramming through legislation premised on the basis that such an idea is flawed.Emanating from a First Minister who is a lawyer and who just a few years ago boasted of her attention to detail, the ignorance and incoherence of her position is staggering.Yet, even after Mr Bullick’s searing critique of the implications of what she is doing, Mrs Foster did not feel compelled to explain herself or even appear in the Assembly chamber for the ten minutes which the Assembly devoted to the bill on Tuesday before nodding it through with only the UUP and People Before Profit dissenting.Since this seminal bill was first published  days ago, the entirety of the time spent by the Assembly and its committees in examining it is a pitul one hour and  minutes - and that includes the time spent voting on the bill.It says much about the Assembly that there has been more scrutiny of this law outside the chamber – by Mr Bullick, Ms O’Loan, and other lawyers – than there has been within the Assembly where not one of the issues they identied were raised, even after they had been covered extensively by this newspaper.What is happening here is reminiscent of another stark example of MLAs’ inability to perform their most basic roles as legislators. On December ,  a largely empty Assembly chamber nodded through legislation to expand the RHI scheme at a point when cash for ash was about to run over budget.As with this bill, many MLAs saw the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations as a dry, technical and uncontroversial bill – with none of them noticing that it was the moment where Mrs Foster’s department had said it would introduce cost controls, which now had vanished.But in at least one sense, what is happening now is even less explicable than what happened then. Not only has the RHI scandal exposed the weaknesses of ministers and civil servants to an extent that MLAs might be expected to interrogate what is put before them, but in  there had not been clear public warnings – as have come from Mr Bullick and Ms O’Loan – about the implications of what was before them.Yet despite the warnings here, and the lack of any counter-argument from Mrs Foster or Ms O’Neill, there is scant evidence of intellectual curiosity on the benches of the DUP, Sinn Féin, SDLP or Alliance as to whether what they have been told by Stormont Castle is any more factual than the contents of the Beano.Out of  MLAs, only one – the UUP’s Doug Beattie – has tabled an amendment which would not deal with the planning issue, but which would stop every other minister being given greater powers.It is emblematic of the signicance of this issue that Mr Bullick, the beating heart of the DUP for longer than Mrs Foster has been in the party, has now publicly endorsed Mr Beattie’s amendment as a means of avoiding the passage of “dangerous” legislation.And yet, there is an argument for this bill. In fact, there is an argument for going much further and giving inidual ministers largely unchecked powers to run departments and then be held accountable by voters.But it’s not an argument with which Mrs Foster has even engaged and it contradicts central DUP policy designed to prevent Sinn Féin ministers being allowed to reshape Northern Ireland in radical ways without a brake in the Executive.But most astonishing is this: Mrs Foster has built this legislation on a fallacy, taking comfort from what she claimed to MLAs was a law which allows three Executive ministers to call any decision into the Executive where the DUP has a veto.Devastatingly, Mr Bullick – the man who perhaps knows this area of law better than anyone in Northern Ireland – has explained that no such power exists. In response, the First Minister never flinched, but carried on regardless.And not only did not a single MLA at any point highlight that the First Minister’s claim was inaccurate, but the SDLP chairman of the committee tasked with scrutinising Mrs Foster’s department, Colin McGrath, uncritically repeated her claim as fact.With an Assembly this self-evidently incompetent scrutinising an Executive proposing legislation it does not understand and which is based on a basic error, what really has changed at Stormont • Arlene Foster still backs ‘dangerous’ law – but offers no rebuttal of ex-aide’s warning• Richard Bullick: The DUP won key safeguards for unionism, yet seems to be sleepwalking into removing them• Morning View: Court ruling cannot be basis for removing essential legal constraints ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
