They\u0027ve found that having these pets is a status symbol. When one dies they simply go back to the wild and get another.\u0027          Videos and images uncovered by Mail Online shows the vulnerable animals being loaded into cars and driven around, or else chained up in small cagesDuring a brief search of Instagram and Facebook, Mail Online uncovered posts which appeared to be offering cheetahs for sale, posted openly on both sites. Other videos show how the big cats are loaded into cars and driven around by their boasting owners.One cheetah is shown watching footage of other wild animals on television, while in another video an adult cat is petted by a child.In one piece of footage a cheetah is shown pacing up and down in a small metal cage, while in another a hissing animal is fed meat while sitting chained up inside a dirty enclosure.Dr Marker is now calling for greater education in both Africa and the Middle East about the impact of cheetah smuggling, and for leaders in both regions to take a stand against the trade.She said: \u0027There is no sense that what is happening is wrong, so we need community leaders to be educated to that effect.\u0027Education and training plays a really important role, but tribal and religious leaders need to lead by example.         Experts say three quarters of cheetahs taken from the wild die before they find a buyer, while those which end up in homes rarely live longer than two years due to malnutrition and disease         A brief search of Instagram and Facebook by Mail Online uncovered what appeared to be adverts for cheetahs, with prices above $6,000         One video showed a big cat forced to watch a programme about of wild cheetahs on TV, while another showed an animal pacing back and forth inside its cage \u0027From a demand side, it comes from a top level down. Influencers such as Sheikhs and Princes need to be telling people that it isn\u0027t something you should be doing. \u0027Peer pressure needs to be happening in the demand side, laws won\u0027t necessarily help because laws are only effective if you can enforce them.\u0027Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have laws that ban the ownership of such pets, but enforcement is lax. As part of her work, Dr Marker helps to rescue some big cats and take them to a shelter in Somaliland - an autonomous region of Somalia.However, she says that half of the cats she receives often died shortly afterwards due to poor treatment at the hands of smugglers, and the future for survivors is often bleak.Most cubs are taken from their mothers between three and ten weeks old, and do not develop the instincts they need to survive in the wild.There is little other option than to keep them in rescue centres or else find special units where they can be housed until a longer-term solution can be found. She added: \u0027Cheetahs are such a special animal, you end up with these tiny cubs that have been pulled from their mothers and are very sickly.\u0027A lot of them die and that\u0027s heartbreaking, it\u0027s horrible, devastating when that occurs.

That\u0027s what you call knowledge of a place?

The chef claimed that inspectors \u0027dared to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé of Reblochon, Beaufort and Tomme\u0027 (pictured)He said a court hearing has been set for November 27 in Nanterre, just west of Paris.\u0027For decades, Marc Veyrat has been used to having his cooking graded, evaluated and compared, and he knows quite well that you don\u0027t own a star for life... He accepts it all, as long as the criticism is accurate,\u0027 Ravanas said. Veyrat, 69, made his name with his so-called \u0027botanical\u0027 cooking, employing the wild herbs gathered around his restaurants in his native Haute Savoie region.Earlier this year the chef, who is instantly recognisable in France for his signature wide-brimmed black Savoyard hat and smoke-tinted glasses, had tried to get Michelin to hand over the inspector notes or the bills proving they had indeed dined at his establishment.He also claimed that a new generation of editors at the head of the guide were trying to make their names by attacking the pillars of French cuisine.But in a statement Monday, Michelin said it \u0027understands the disappointment for Mr Veyrat, whose talent no one contests, even if we regret his unreasonable persistance with his accusations.\u0027\u0027Our first duty is to tell consumers why we have changed our recommendation. We will carefully study his demands and respond calmly,\u0027 it said.Veyrat\u0027s recovery of a third star for La Maison du Bois in 2018 capped a comeback after he was forced to give up cooking a decade ago after a serious skiing accident.         Veyrat\u0027s La Maison des Bois restaurant in the French Alps was demoted to two stars from the maximum three last January, just a year after he secured the industry\u0027s highest accolade He had previously won three stars for two other restaurants.The intense strains of reaching cooking\u0027s highest spheres - and the financial impacts of losing Michelin stars - have been highlighted in recent years by the suicides of several top chefs.French chef Bernard Loiseau shot himself in 2003 after a newspaper hinted that his restaurant was about to lose its three-star status.And Benoit Violier ended his life in 2016 just months after his Swiss restaurant was named the best in the world in the La Liste ranking."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle seen public wearing headscarf time","story":"Take it to the max like Meghan in a chic shirt dress by StaudPre-order it here...It\u0026#39s day two of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s tour of Southern Africa, and already we\u0026#39ve seen a number of outfit changes from Meghan.

In 2014, a painting of Judith and Holofernes turned up in an attic in Toulouse and was sensationally attributed to Caravaggio. This summer it was sold in a private deal. And wait – the same expert who has authenticated this domestic discovery and is selling it together with Senlis auction house Acteon is also the man who defied doubters to successfully promote the Toulouse Caravaggio.Clearly, Eric Turquin has got a very good eye for world-class treasures hidden in plain sight in sleepy French homes. Or has he got a breathless tendency to over-enthuse about “discoveries” that may be more complex than they seem?This has all the hallmarks of the marketing campaign that made the “Caravaggio in the attic” such a hit. The magic of finding a masterpiece in (or close to) a kitchen is an irresistible story. So irresistible it makes sceptics sound like spoilsports. We do not need to question Turquin’s good faith. But we do need to stand back and recognise the astonishing nature of the claim being made.If this is truly a Cimabue, it is a rare surviving work by the painter credited by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 book The Lives of the Artists with liberating Italian art from starchy Byzantine formality by making human figures more alive and objects more three-dimensional. Those traits do appear in his “new” painting The Mocking of Christ: a crowd of impassioned people surround Jesus in front of two buildings that are shown in depth and shaded. Not much, but a beginning – the start of the discovery of real-life in art that would lead to Leonardo da Vinci.Yet any unsigned painting found in a kitchen corridor surely needs lengthy appraisal by many different experts. What’s worrying is the way this painting, like the Caravaggio from the loft, is being boldly called a Cimabue without wider discussion. This is the new norm at the profitable end of the Old Masters market. Great stories about unlikely discoveries sweep all before them, but art experts have recently been fooled by proven fakes. Shouldn’t the whole business of identifying masterpieces be a little more nuanced when there are known to be actual forgers out there doing uncannily convincing work? Not that I am saying this is a fake – just that the identification of old paintings is and always has been fraught with peril. It shouldn’t be accepted solely on the seller’s say-so, or because it makes a good story.It’s hard to be certain about Cimabue’s style. He is a near-legendary figure. Fewer than 20 of his paintings survive and they show just the rudiments of an artistic personality. His contemporary Dante wrote that he was made to look old hat by his younger and much more characterful rival, Giotto. Vasari falsely claimed he painted the Rucellai Madonna, a famous altarpiece in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence that is credited today to the Sienese artist Duccio. This wasn’t an innocent mistake: Vasari was court artist to the Medici and wanted to credit Florence with starting the Renaissance. He therefore bigged up Cimabue and downplayed the equally pioneering painters of Siena.Are we doing the same to excitedly call this painting a Cimabue? Could its mixture of mystical gold space and real-life detail be by someone else? If attributed to a “follower of Cimabue” or even to a Sienese master, it would be less glamorous and less coveted than an original by this revered painter. Anyway, those people crowding Christ look a bit post-medieval to me. Maybe this painting was heavily restored at some time in the nearly 800-year history being credited to it, another potential complexity that would make it less super-marketable. A historical work of art is necessarily a mysterious thing: the more chiaroscuro you admit, the less of a drop-dead, solid-gold commodity it becomes.But questions are boring, and hesitation is dull. This is the Cimabue in the kitchen, and it’s yours to buy for about six million euros."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376bfae521c084234c325a5890c76f846d9f2ae0/1044_0_5011_3006/master/5011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c593344e7121addd38af0a1fff8558","title":"untapped treasure wallace collection to start lending artworks","story":"World-renowned London collection to allow loans after review of Lady Wallace’s willTreasures from one of the world’s finest collections of art, armoury, furniture and porcelain are to be made available for loans to galleries nationally and internationally for the first time in 119 years.The Wallace Collection in London includes superstar paintings such as Frans Hals’ The Laughing Cavalier, Diego Velázquez’s The Lady with a Fan and Nicolas Poussin’s A Dance to the Music of Time.But none have ever been permitted to leave. The collection, bequeathed to the nation in 1897, has always been considered a closed collection because of the terms of a will left by Lady Wallace.It was announced on Tuesday that lawyers and art experts had re-examined the terms of the will and decided they did not prevent loans, a conclusion endorsed by the UK government and the Charity Commission.The decision will herald a revolution for the Wallace Collection, its director, Xavier Bray, said. “For me it is a bit like the Hobbit and you see that dragon just sitting on the treasure, not letting anybody get close to it. This is a major new chapter for the Wallace, it’s likely to be transformative in terms of how we work and how our curators and conservation staff think about the collection.”The banker António Horta-Osório, who chairs the trustees, said it represented a hugely significant moment in the history of the collection. “It will enable us to put the collection in the 21st century.”The Wallace Collection has been housed in Hertford House in central London since 1870 and opened to the public as a museum in 1900.Bray was appointed three years ago and made challenging the loans policy a priority. “We are in central London and have this great collection but it has been rather isolating,” he said. “Working at the Wallace is quite a monastic existence because people know they will never get anything out of you.”The interpretation of the bequest has meant its Hals has never been seen alongside another Hals the same for its Velázquez. When the National Gallery said it would next year put on display five of six works from Titian’s “poesie” paintings, it could not include in its plans the sixth one at the Wallace.The gallery also has arguably the most important collection of 18th-century French art outside France, with masterpieces by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Eugène Delacroix. Its collection of princely arms and armour is considered world-class. None of it has ever been lent.“The collection has been very static,” said Bray. “Art historically, from my point of view, it is a revolution. It means that we can start really understanding our collection better by juxtaposing it with other objects from other collections.”The Wallace stressed that loans, beginning in 2020, would be approved on an exceptional basis. “We will start slowly and then we will see how things go,” said Horta-Osório, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group.The interpretation has been based on a line that the collection “shall remain together … unmixed with other objects”. Bray said this did not mean loans were expressly forbidden, pointing out that Sir Richard Wallace was a proud and enthusiastic lender of objects.“This is a beautiful, untapped treasure which of course we will look after for future generations … things that can’t travel will not travel. But if things are done well and according to the rules, it is like bringing fresh air to the collection and just making it live again.”• This article was amended on 24 September 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the National Gallery displaying Titian’s “poesie” paintings this year. That exhibition will take place in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2f3471a323a079dd7d457e0da703ee846f96a31/0_0_5471_3655/master/5471.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e47cf3f94e259ba4e85795650d660541 960w","title":"david cameron memoir margaret atwood dystopia for the record","story":"For the Record, the former PM’s account of his time in office sold close to 21,000 copies in its first week, behind Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments, which topped 100,000Almost 21,000 people rushed out to buy a copy of David Cameron’s memoir in its first week on sale, placing it second on the latest book charts to Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments and, historically, behind Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair for the title of fastest-selling political memoir by a former prime minister.Published on last Tuesday, For the Record had sold 20,792 copies by Saturday, according to figures just released by official book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. When Blair’s A Journey was published in 2010 – amid cancellation of launch events over protests from anti-war campaigners – it sold 92,060 copies in its first four days on sale. At the time, this made it the fastest-selling autobiography since Nielsen began to track book sales in 1998.Cameron’s sales make For the Record the bestselling non-fiction hardback of the week, and the second bestselling book overall, behind Atwood’s much-anticipated follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale, which sold 103,177 copies in hardback in its first five days.Blair has sold almost 350,000 copies of his autobiography to date, but lost the title of fastest-selling memoir in 2013 when Manchester United football manager Alex Ferguson’s memoirs shifted 115,000 in the first week.In comparison, John Major sold just 5,415 copies of his memoir in its first week, but went on to top 200,000 in total. Edward Heath’s The Course of My Life, published in 1998, has yet to top 20,000 copies, while Gordon Brown’s My Life, Our Times has sold 27,846 altogether.All pale in comparison to Margaret Thatcher, whose memoir The Downing Street Years is believed to have shifted 120,000 copies in a week (an estimated figure as it was published before Nielsen’s records began). It has sold more than 500,000 copies since.Cameron’s publisher Harper Collins said it was “delighted” by the figures and that the memoir’s audiobook had been its biggest ever in the first week of release.Richard Humphreys, nonfiction buyer for Waterstones, said all signed copies of the memoir had sold out: “We are very pleased with how well the book has done … prime ministerial memoirs are always keenly awaited and despite the controversy of his exit from Downing Street and the subsequent political tumult, this has been a widely sought after book in our shops.”Cameron’s 700-page book, dealing with the former prime minister’s decision to call a referendum on British membership of the European Union in 2016, was described as a truthful account by Jonathan Freedland in the . But Freedland found that the “litany of confessed errors gradually loses its charm”, and “at a certain point, the reader stops feeling sympathy for the author and concludes that he was just serially and unforgivably wrong. For the Record is meant to be the case for the defence. In fact, Cameron has written his own indictment.”In the , Allison Pearson found similarly, calling it “an exhaustive (and exhausting) case for the Defence”, in which “the author is like a driver who, in a moment of madness, caused an almighty pile-up and tries to convince a jury to go easy on him, offering plentiful evidence of previous good conduct.”Writing in the Standard, editor George Osborne, who was Cameron’s chancellor, found it to be “one of the very best” political memoirs, although he admitted he was not neutral because Cameron is his friend. “His book has been so hard for him to write. It’s been a kind of purgatory for him, motivated by a sense of duty that prime ministers should explain why they did what they did, for the record. It’s why it is so good,” wrote Osborne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f3bc5cdf64be60152a76c01a9dada92ffa3c89/0_233_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b8b2a94f688a7e4114f64955c48a6b","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

In a statement Neumann said he was “proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade”.“While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,” he said. Neumann says he will continue on as non-executive chairman.The company, now known as We, is one of the world’s most valuable startups and Neumann’s demotion marks a dramatic fall from grace from one of the most high-profile executives of the new generation of tech companies.We scrapped plans for an initial public offering last month after investors balked at the company’s sky-high valuation. We had been valued at $47bn, despite losing $3bn in the last three years. That price was cut by more than half ahead of the proposed share sale but even that price seemed too high to many investors.Investors were also concerned that Neumann had taken $700m out of the company ahead of the share sale and would keep tight control even after it.Meetings between the board and We’s largest investor, Japan’s SoftBank, began on Monday to discuss the possibility of Neumann being demoted.Those meetings came after the Journal reported a private jet chartered by Neumann had to be grounded after a large amount of marijuana was found onboard. The report also detailed tequila-fuelled company parties and bizarre statements by Neumann about his plans to become immortal and to use We to “solve the problem of children without parents”.According to tech news source The Information, WeWork executives and the company’s bankers have been discussing laying off a third of We’s workforce, some 5,000 people, among various plans to cut costs at the heavily loss-making company.WeWork has shaken up the sleepy world of office rentals by leasing space, giving them a millennial make-over with potted plants, communal areas and beer taps and then leasing them to start-ups and other would be entrepreneurs.WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members and 528 locations at the end of June and said it plans to open 169 new locations. In London, it owns or leases more spaces than any enterprise except the government. Larger companies (including the ) also rent WeWork space.But while the company has grown fast, so have its losses and even We has conceded that it may never make a profit.We’s revenues in 2018 were $1.82bn, more than four times larger than they were in 2016. At the same time the company lost $2.9bn in the last three years.The company’s share sale prospectus warned: “We have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level … for the foreseeable future.”We has burned through more than $2bn in 2018 and on current projections could run out of cash sometime next year if its fortunes do not turn or it fails to raise more money.Softbank has invested more than $9bn in the company and has reportedly soured on Neumann’s leadership in recent months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb340903fa8f39721807d4ff8e583dde449bd9f4/18_232_2903_1742/master/2903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea07bf01ce7ed50674cb3f0643051e35","title":"metro bank shares plunge after investors snub 200m bond sale","story":" understands that  had only attracted £175m worth of orders, prompting it to pull the plug.Russ Mould, the investment director of AJ Bell, said: “The cancellation of a £200m bond sale is another major blow to  Bank, leaving management with red faces and the shares sinking even further. Bank, which reported 1.8 million customer accounts in July, insisted it was in a strong position, and said it had cancelled the sale because of tough market conditions.’s borrowing costs have soared since January, when it revealed it had misclassified £900m worth of loans as being less risky than they actually were. The discovery meant the bank had a smaller capital cushion to protect it from a larger pool of risky loans in the event of a downturn. It prompted an investigation by financial regulators, which was widened recently to include  Bank’s senior managers. That investigation is continuing.Monday’s bond sale was part of the bank’s efforts to meet EU regulatory requirements by the end of 2019, which would help it wind down effectively in a crisis without using taxpayer cash.If  Bank fails to conduct a successful sale in the coming months, it may be forced to ask the Bank of England to postpone its year-end deadline to meet its so-called minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL).John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said there were a number of risks that had deterred bond investors from taking part in Monday’s sale.He said investors were concerned that the financial regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority could raise its capital requirements, in order to provide a larger cushion against  Bank’s risky assets following the accounting scandal.Cronin also pointed to existing lawsuits over the accounting issue, and said further legal action could be on the cards, which could affect ’s finances.Citi analysts said  actually needed to issue £1bn worth of debt – £500m in 2019 and the same amount in 2020 – in order to meet its requirements, assuming Citi’s growth forecasts for  stay on track.Citi said  could consider selling a portion of its mortgage business to meet the regulatory requirements, but that move risks putting further strain on ’s earnings.A takeover may be more likely, but it is not clear who might be poised to snap up the high street lender.“The best owner for  would be a strategic buyer, but we struggle to identify obvious candidates,” Citi analysts added. Bank is already on the hunt for candidates to replace its chairman, Vernon Hill, who founded the bank in 2010, making it the first new bank to open on Britain’s high streets in over a century.The company announced in July the 73-year old would be stepping down, at a time of shareholder pressure to overhaul its leadership. In May,  Bank announced it was severing links with the architecture firm owned by Hill’s wife, amid criticism over £25m worth of payments made by the lender to her business.

Flowers are part of the heritage of Dior. But when I see flowers and gardens now, I don’t see just joy, or the beauty of nature. I see all the concerns about our future, and the need to take action,” said Chiuri before the show. “So I was asking myself, how can we celebrate nature in a meaningful way?A temporary grove of 164 trees set the stage for the collection, ready for planting in protective burlap grow bags. This was a collaboration with Coloco, a collective of urban landscapers whose philosophy is to “facilitate active exchange between citizens and nature” through communal gardens. Chiuri had hoped to stage the show in one of their urban gardens, “but the logistics didn’t work out.”Instead, the trees will be repurposed in sustainability projects in the Paris region, reinforcing wooded areas – the GoodPlanet Foundation in Longchamp and the Murs à Pêches site in Montreuil – and creating urban groves in the city’s heart, as well as on Base 217, the former Air Force base in Brétigny-Sur-Orge.Feminism being to Chiuri’s era at Dior what pearls were to Coco Chanel, there was also a feminist angle. Muse for the clothes on the catwalk was Catherine Dior, the designer’s sister, a member of the resistance and a devoted plantswoman who later became one of the first women in France to hold a professional licence for wholesale floristry. “She was a great woman,” said Chiuri backstage, pointing to a photo on the season’s mood board of Catherine in her gardening clothes: a man’s shirt, sleeves rolled up, with belted trousers.The long skirts which have been a Dior motif throughout Chiuri’s tenure came in rough hessian, paired with a shirt in utility blue. The embroidered “book tote” which has been this year’s smash hit, doubled as a trug, carrying forks and trowels. There were shades of Vita Sackville-West, who was also name-checked on the backstage moodboard, in the loose trousers and casual espadrilles.The botanical prints of 17th-century German botanist Maria Sybilla Merian were the starting point for prints tracing the darker beauty of thistles and poppies and wild flowers, as well as roses and delicate, cultivated flowers. Under their low-brimmed hats, the long haired models wore their hair in twin plaits - a style which at this moment in time can only be read as a reference to Greta Thunberg.Under Chiuri, Christian Dior has come to rival Louis Vuitton as the star name in the pedigree stable of luxury group LVMH. In 2018 Dior’s sales were over €5bn for the first time, putting the house in an elite group of the biggest six luxury players alongside Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Cartier and Hermès.Profit margins at Dior still trail those at Chanel – a unicorn among the fashion houses, with an alchemy of aspiration and pop appeal that remains a secret formula – but they are growing fast. A new Morgan Stanley research report named Dior as “a real standout of the industry”, with operating profits expected to reach €1bn in 2019, putting them five times higher than they were a decade ago. “Perception rankings”, which evaluate consumer prestige, are also tracking higher than ever.But addressing the issue of greenwashing, Chiuri acknowledged that the message of the show is not a true reflection of the current state of the fashion industry, which continues to damage the environment. “The times that we live in now plant a lot of doubts in my mind about what I do, working in fashion,” she said backstage.“Fashion has a voice and the power to speak to people, but right now I have many more questions than I have answers.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf970dd3cd1c775c62c66f6b63f8b246d76fce5/265_84_993_596/master/993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28087f112e68bc8ae492ffce536c1c5e","title":"say it with a brooch how a fashion item became a political statement","story":"The judge is the latest powerful woman to use a brooch to make a coded statementLady Hale’s image was beamed across the world with all the signifiers of the supreme court – papers, judge’s bench, austere clothing. It was the court’s stunning verdict that would dominate the headlines, of course, but the judge’s spider brooch – pinned to her black dress – had the optics that made it a story of its own.Wearing a spider to deliver news that trapped the prime minister felt pointed – a message backed on a safety pin. Twitter certainly read it that way. “What could Brenda Hale be telling us with her AMAZING giant spider brooch?” wrote @Anna_Girling. By Tuesday afternoon, there was a call for the brooch to have its own Twitter account.A spokesperson for the company said: “We often print topical t-shirts, and as everyone on Twitter was talking about the brooch we thought it was a great angle for a new design. We can’t believe it’s taken off quite the way it has. We picked Shelter as homelessness appears to be a growing problem in Uxbridge, and it’s nice to do our part.”Brooches are enjoying something of a moment in fashion this autumn – seen on the catwalk at Versace and Erdem – but Hale is a brooch trailblazer. She has a particular fondness for creepy crawlies – frogs, beetles and the like. On her profile on the supreme court website, she wears a brooch of a caterpillar – like the spider, it’s an animal that hardly has the cute factor on its side.With the spider, Hale joins a list of high-profile women who have used the seemingly unassuming brooch to send a message – at least, some observers think so.The Queen’s brooches for Donald Trump’s visit in 2018 – one of which was given to her by Barack Obama – were interpreted as statements of her displeasure with the current US president.Madeleine Albright, as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, was open about her use of brooches – or “pins” to Americans.

I like to cook this dish in late September and October as the grapes are fully ripe and ready to pick for harvest. When I have served this dish in the past, I make the sauce separately, then serve with a char-grilled whole dover sole and garnish with wood roasted sweet and caramelised grapes.Serves 2olive oil 2 tbsp Dover sole fillets 4 plain floursalt unsalted butter 50g seedless red grapes 150g, half cut in halfwhite grape juice 25ml dry white wine 25 ml vermouth 25ml fish stock 25ml drained capers 1 tbsp fresh parsley 1 tbsp chopped lemon juice black pepperHeat the oil in a nonstick pan over a medium heat. Season the sole fillets with a light coating of flour and salt, and fry over a medium heat (around 2 minutes on each side), until the fish is almost cooked and has developed a slight golden colour.Remove the fish from the pan and rest. Add the butter and whole grapes and begin to cook them gently, then add the grape juice, white wine and vermouth, and bring to the boil, then add the fish stock. Reduce this sauce to thicken (around 5 minutes).Turn the heat off and return the sole to the sauce, with the halved grapes, capers, parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice and some black pepper and extra salt to taste.Serve with wilted greens.Tomos Parry is chef-owner of Brat, London E1I love hispi cabbage in all its forms, but especially slow-cooked and smothered in buttery, spicy clams.Serves 4hispi cabbage 2 small olive oilchilli 1 tsp, deseeded and finely chopped garlic ½ clove, finely choppeddried oregano 1 tsp white wine ½ glass clams 200g (or mussels), cleaned, any open ones discardedunsalted butter 20g pepperPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage and cut the cabbage in half lengthways. On a medium heat, heat some olive oil in a pan big enough to fit the length of cabbage. Working in batches, colour the cabbage on its cut side until golden. Put into a roasting tray.Wipe away any cabbage debris from the pan and discard, then add a glug of olive oil and add the chilli, garlic and oregano. Fry for 2-3 minutes, until starting to colour, then add the white wine and reduce for 3 minutes.Transfer into the roasting tray with the cabbage and add the uncooked clams. Mix together, add a couple of centimetres of water, the butter and some pepper, then cover tightly with foil and put in the oven. Roast for 20 minutes until the cabbage is soft at the root and the clams are open (discard any closed ones). Taste to see if it needs salt (the clams might have done the job for you).From Trullo by Tim Siadatan (Square Peg, £25)This recipe feels a bit like going to some of the small museums you’ll find around Scandinavia, housing paintings by the old masters. When I eat this I can see the landscape in those paintings, the potatoes from the soil, the apples that grow on the trees, the ducks walking around in the villages, and the dark kitchens that smell of cabbage. It is a little bit like time travel.For the brown cabbage (brunkål)white cabbage 1.5kg butter 75gcaster sugar 50g black peppercorns 1 tsp allspice 2 tsp caraway seeds 2 tsp bay leaves 2 thyme sprigs 10 sea salt and freshly ground black pepperlemon juice to tasteGrind the spices to a coarse mixture using a pestle and mortar. Mix in the salt, rub the mixture into the duck legs and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Place the duck legs in a roasting tin and roast for 1 hour, now and then basting the duck legs with the fat rendering into the tin as they cook.For the brown cabbage, cut the cabbage into medium-thin slices. Melt the butter and cook until light brown, then add the sugar and let it melt into a light brown caramel. Stir well, then add the cabbage, spices and herbs and stir well. Reduce the heat to low, cover and let it simmer for about 2 hours. Take off the heat season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.Meanwhile, cut the potatoes and apples into wedges. When the duck legs have roasted for an hour, add the potatoes to the tin and roast for another 45 minutes, then add the apples, mix well with the juices in the roasting tin and roast for another 15 minutes. Check that the duck meat is tender and, if not, continue to cook a little longer. Serve with the brown cabbage.From Scandinavian Comfort Food: Embracing the Art of Hygge by Trine Hahnemann (Quadrille, £26)I like a coarse-cut, spicy sausage to cook with haricot beans. The pork, fennel seeds and black-pepper-seasoned sausages that hang in Italian grocers, displayed in plump clusters tied together with string, to be exact. Of course, any good sausages will fit the bill, as long as they are so generously filled they look like their skins are about to burst.The recipe can be upscaled easily to cater for large numbers, but add the harissa paste to taste rather than simply multiplying the amount.Serves 2-3olive oil 2 tbspsausages 6 large onion 1rosemary 5 sprigsharissa paste 2 tsptomatoes 4 medium haricot or cannellini beans 2 x 400g canschicken stock 200mlUsing a little of the olive oil, brown the sausages in a shallow, ovenproof pan over a low to moderate heat, turning them regularly so they brown as evenly as possible. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Peel the onion and roughly chop it. Remove the sausages and set them aside, then add the remaining olive oil to the pan and then the chopped onion, letting it soften and colour lightly. It should be the palest gold. Remove the leaves from 2 of the sprigs of rosemary, finely chop them, then add them to the softened onion with a pinch of salt.Stir the harissa paste into the onion. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Add the chopped tomatoes to the onion and rosemary and cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes have started to soften. Drain the beans, rinse them under running water, stir them into the onion, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, then return the sausages to the pan. Check the seasoning then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s cookery writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ebd495a2839a6c6eac024cecdc4f1551fae8699/0_0_1898_1139/master/1898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0833db493fa3f697653fdca5f3ba506","title":"manchester united announce record revenue but say focus is on winning trophies","story":"Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has offered Ole Gunnar Solskjær his long-term backing in response to the manager’s mixed results at the start of the season.United are 10 points behind league leaders Liverpool after six matches, and criticism not just of Solskjær but of the club’s structure resurfaced after the disappointing defeat at West Ham at the weekend.Announcing record financial revenues of £627.1m for the year ending 30 June – a figure expected to drop next year because of expensive new contracts for key players and United’s failure to qualify for the Champions League – Woodward insisted he was optimistic for the future.“The progress we’ve made on the business side underpins our continued investment in the football side,” he said. “Much of the investment in the academy, the recruitment department and the training ground facilities is not immediately apparent to those on the outside, but we believe we have put the building blocks in place for success.“While we are confident this investment will deliver results it is important that we are patient as Ole and his team build for the future.

A report, by the House of Commons public accounts committee, questioned the doubling of the Newton Fund, managed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, to £735m, despite the department’s “weak understanding” of how funds were spent, where and with what results.The criticism follows Boris Johnson’s announcement that £1bn in aid money will be spent by BEIS and DfID on efforts to tackle the climate emergency.Meg Hillier, the chair of PAC, said: “As we highlighted with the Newton Fund, the danger is that it becomes the case for spending money where we cannot determine effectiveness.“They haven’t got a system in place yet for overseas aid that is going through other routes. We have to be careful aid is going to those in greatest need. We’re not convinced there are measures in place to look at impact in departments other than DfID and we need to have this in place before we throw money in other directions.”Asked about Johnson’s announcement on Sunday, Hillier said: “A promise is the headline. Effectiveness is the delivery on the ground.”MPs said more needed to be done by the government to show the £14bn spent on foreign aid is effective. DfID is the only department to meet the government’s transparency targets, it said.The report also highlighted a “significant risk” to value for money of the £1.4bn of aid the UK currently contributes to the EU’s development budget under a no-deal Brexit.“If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the government may need to redistribute quickly up to £1.4bn to meet the ODA spending target in 2019 – a situation which would create a risk to value for money,” it found.Dr Alison Doig, head of global policy at Christian Aid, said Johnson’s announcement was “like robbing Peter to pay Paul, when in reality new and additional money is needed in the face of the climate emergency”.“We very much welcome news of promoting and spreading UK scientific knowledge abroad, but our hope is that it will be implemented in the right way and not end up as tied aid that is expensive and undermines the capacity of scientists in developing countries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

He was dismissive of both.“If it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” Knowles said.The commentator Christopher Hahn, appearing on The Story to theoretically offer a liberal perspective, immediately criticized Knowles.“Yeah, I mean, you’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child. Shame on you,” Hahn said.A Fox News spokesperson subsequently told the Daily Beast: “The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful. We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.”Fox News told the Hollywood Reporter it had “no plans” to book Knowles as a guest in the future.The channel has not commented on Laura Ingraham’s attack on Thunberg.Ingraham used her show The Ingraham Angle to suggest, incorrectly, that Thunberg wanted people to “cede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don’t go along, we will be punished by our own children.“Does anyone else find that chilling?” Ingraham said.“I can’t wait for Stephen King’s sequel, Children of the Climate.”King’s fictional story The Children of the Corn focuses on a group of children in a remote town who believe anyone over the age of 19 should be killed.Curtis Ingraham, Laura Ingraham’s brother, swiftly criticized his sister, suggesting that her rightwing pronouncements were motivated by financial gain.He said: “Clearly my sister’s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit.“I can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize.

She never arrived. So began one of Germany’s most notorious postwar criminal cases, which remains contentious to this day. By  Xan RiceIn the Alpine foothills in the far south of Germany is a vast lake called the Ammersee. Its shores are dotted with centuries-old villages where wealthy families from Munich buy large second homes and tourists drink beer at waterfront restaurants. At the north end of the lake is a pair of such villages, Eching am Ammersee and Schondorf, less than two miles apart. Separating them is a block of spruce forest that attracts hunters, joggers, mountain bikers and in the late summer 38 years ago, kidnappers preparing to commit what would become one of the country’s most notorious postwar crimes.After class on Tuesday 15 September 1981, the first day of the new school year, a 10-year-old girl named Ursula Herrmann returned to her house in Eching. Ursula, the youngest of four siblings, practised piano with her oldest brother Michael, and then headed off to her late afternoon gymnastics lesson in Schondorf, cycling through the forest along the lakeside path. When the gym class was over, she went to her cousin’s house in Schondorf, where she ate dinner. At 7.20pm, Ursula’s mother phoned the aunt to say her daughter needed to come home. The shadows were lengthening but it was still light, and the cycle ride would only take 10 minutes.Half an hour later, she was still not home. Her mother again called the aunt, who said Ursula had left 25 minutes before. Both of them immediately knew something was wrong. Ursula’s father rushed into the forest from Eching, and her uncle did the same from Schondorf. They met in the middle, along the path. Ursula’s name rang out through the darkening wood. But there was no reply.Within an hour neighbours, police and firemen had joined the search, torch beams raking the water and struggling to penetrate the thick undergrowth. With midnight approaching, and rain falling, a sniffer dog led its handler away from the lake, into the brush. There, 20 metres from the path, was Ursula’s little red bike. But she was nowhere to be seen.At first light the search intensified. Dozens of officers wearing raincoats and rubber boots spread out through the dense forest, on the border of which stands Landheim Schondorf, an expensive private school founded in 1905 and favoured by Bavaria’s political and business elite. As a helicopter hovered overhead, a police boat and ers scanned the shallows of the lake. Local radio carried the shocking news of the missing girl in an idyllic part of the country: 1.43m (4ft 7in) tall with short blonde hair, wearing dark green cords, a grey woollen cardigan and red-brown sandals the daughter of a teacher and a housewife.On the Thursday morning, when Ursula had been missing for more than 36 hours, the phone rang in the Herrmann house. When Ursula’s parents picked up there was silence, and then a short, familiar jingle, which they recognised from the traffic bulletin on the Bayern 3 radio station. More silence ensued, and then the jingle played again before the caller hung up. Three more similar calls – baffling and sinister – followed over a period of hours. A team from the local police department, now stationed inside the Herrmann home, began recording the calls.When the phone rang that afternoon, and the jingle sounded, Ursula’s mother agreed to pay the ransom. She also asked for proof of life: what were her daughter’s nicknames for her two stuffed toys? When the kidnappers did not reply, she became frantic. “Talk to me, say something, something from Ursula!”That same evening, the kidnappers posted a second letter, which arrived on Monday 21 September, with curiously specific instructions regarding the ransom. The kidnappers wanted the money to be paid in used 100-deutschmark bills, packed in a suitcase. It was to be delivered to an as yet unnamed location by Ursula’s father, who was to drive alone in a yellow Fiat 600 going no faster than 90kmh.Unlike some other residents of Eching, and the parents of the pupils at the boarding school in Schondorf, the Herrmanns were not wealthy. They had only been able to build a home near the lake because Ursula’s great-grandfather had purchased some grazing land there decades earlier. A neighbour raised part of the ransom, and the state agreed to cover the rest.The Herrmanns waited desperately for more instructions. But there were no more letters and no more calls. Nor did the police have any strong leads. Two weeks passed. The police decided to search the forest again. More than a hundred officers were assembled, with 10 sniffer dogs. The wood was ided into four parts, and each quarter into small grids. The teams began searching every grid, one by one, using metal rods to probe the ground.By the fourth day of searching, a gloomy Sunday, they had covered most of the forest. Ursula had been missing for 19 days. At 9.30am, there was a loud shout. In a tiny glade about 800m away from the lake path, one of the officers had struck something solid when probing the soil. Another policeman rushed over and, after wiping away the leaves and scraping through a layer of clay, discovered a brown blanket covering a wooden board. He removed it only to find second board, which appeared to be the lid of a box. It was 72cm by 60cm – the size of a small coffee table – painted green and locked from the top with seven sliding bolts. Using a spade, he forced the lid open, and peered in. There was Ursula. Her body was cold, lifeless. The officer wept when lifting her out.Two detectives were sent to break the news to Ursula’s parents at their home, a short walk away. While her mother was too distraught to ask any questions, her father asked repeatedly: had his daughter been hurt before her death? The truthful answer was no. An autopsy concluded that Ursula died within 30 minutes to five hours of being buried. Since there was no sign of struggle, or even movement, inside the box, the doctors assumed she had been drugged beforehand, possibly with nitrous oxide.It appeared that the kidnappers had planned to keep Ursula alive. The box, 1.40m deep, was fitted with a shelf and a seat that doubled as a toilet. It was stocked with three bottles of water, 12 cans of Fanta, six large chocolate bars, four packets of biscuits and two packs of chewing gum. It also contained a small, bizarre library of 21 books, from Donald Duck comics to westerns, romance novels and thrillers with titles such as The Horror Lurks Everywhere. There was a light and a portable radio tuned to Bayern 3, the same station that broadcast the traffic jingle. To enable Ursula to breathe, the box had a ventilation system made from plastic plumbing pipes, which extended to ground level. But whoever designed it had failed to realise that without a machine to circulate the air, the oxygen would quickly run out.The police believed they were hunting more than one kidnapper, because of the size and weight of the box. At 60kg, it would probably have needed at least two people to carry it into the woods. The perpetrators must have known the forest well, for they had chosen a remote site within it, and had avoided attention while digging the hole and hacking paths through the dense brush.In Eching and nearby villages, parents who previously let their children roam free were now terrified to let them out of sight. The shock was amplified by the frenzied press coverage. On the day of the funeral, after much harassment from journalists, Ursula’s brother Michael, a shy 18-year-old, lost his temper with a photographer who held a camera right in front of his face, and knocked the camera to the ground.Desperate to find the culprits, the police offered a DM30,000 reward for information, and tips poured in. One name that came up was Werner Mazurek. He was 31, lived with his wife and their two children just a few hundred metres from the Herrmanns. A trained car mechanic who left school at 15 and now ran his own TV repair business, Mazurek was good with his hands. He was imposing – tall, with a beer-drinker’s stomach – and quick-tempered, and not well liked in Eching. He was also heavily in debt, owing a bank more than DM140,000, so he had a motive.Questioned by police a week after Ursula’s body was found, Mazurek could not initially recall his movements on the night she went missing. It took him 24 hours to provide an alibi: he had been playing the board game Risk with his wife and two friends. But a search of his home and workshop revealed nothing that linked him to the crime. Later that month, the forensics team examining the box found a fingerprint on a piece of duct tape, raising hopes of a breakthrough. Thousands of locals, including Mazurek, were fingerprinted, but no match was discovered.The police still suspected that Mazurek was involved. At the end of January 1982, they arrested him, along with two of his friends, and interrogated them for several days before releasing them. A month later, another of Mazurek’s acquaintances was questioned. Klaus Pfaffinger was an unemployed mechanic with a drinking problem. His landlord, who was owed rent, had told police that in the weeks before the crime he had seen his tenant driving his moped with a spade strapped to the side. Pfaffinger initially protested his innocence. But on the second day of questioning, when the interrogators took a break and he was alone with the police secretary, he said a startling thing: “What if I know something?” When the interrogators returned, Pfaffinger told them that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest in early September 1981, promising payment of DM1,000 and a colour television. Pfaffinger said he had dug the hole and had later seen a box embedded inside.Convinced they had cracked the case, the detectives drove Pfaffinger to the forest that separated Eching and Schondorf. They asked him to lead them to the burial site. To their dismay, he was unable to locate it, or even come close. On returning to the police station, he announced: “I am revoking this confession, it’s not true what I said.” During at least 10 subsequent interrogations in the following months, he refused to repeat his confession, and was eventually released without charge.By the summer of 1982, after his name was smeared, Mazurek was preparing to move away from Eching with his family. The lead detective who had pursued him was replaced, and the net cast more widely. Some 100,000 colour posters requesting help with the investigation were distributed nationwide. A television programme, Aktenzeichen XY ... Ungelöst – Case number XY … Unsolved – which would serve as the model for the BBC’s Crimewatch and America’s Most Wanted, featured a long segment on the Ursula Herrmann case. The new police team found more evidence of the kidnappers’ methods, including a wire that they had strung through the trees along the lakeside path to serve as an alert system during the abduction. But investigations of other suspects came to nothing. By the end of the 1980s, the investigation had wound down. Across Germany, most people still remembered the shocking unsolved case of the 10-year-old girl buried alive in the box.Ursula’s parents and siblings, meanwhile, were doing their best to move on with their lives. Though they grieved deeply for Ursula, who they remembered as an intelligent, energetic girl who loved to sing and paint, they did so in private, never speaking to the press. Soon after their youngest child’s death, the parents had made a conscious decision not to let the hunt for the kidnappers consume the family, or the tragedy define their lives. Without any known perpetrators to blame, they tried to think of it as a terrible accident. It was hardest for Ursula’s mother, who believed she should have gone to fetch her daughter from her cousin’s house. Ursula’s father and sister turned to their strong Christian faith to find peace. Her youngest brother eventually found solace in surfing.Michael, the elder brother, who was in his final year of school at the time of the crime, was playing music at a friend’s house on the night Ursula disappeared. When his mother called in a panic, saying his little sister was missing, he rushed home and joined the search for her in the forest. He was devastated when her body was found. “Then it quickly turned into: what can I do with this now?” he told me recently. “Because I knew the ‘why’ could never be answered. I decided: I am alive and I have some tasks to do.”In the mid-2000s, the Bavarian state office for criminal investigations started looking in earnest at its backlog of cold cases. The most famous was the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, which had by then appeared three times on Case number XY … Unsolved, and was still a stain on the reputation of the local police and judiciary. Prosecutors hoped that the development of DNA profiling over the previous two decades might help crack the case. The mass of evidence from the original investigation, including the ransom notes and the box, was painstakingly re-examined. Numerous hairs were found, from which the forensic experts were able to build the DNA profiles of several different people. Now they just needed a match. In 2007 they got one.A genetic sample recovered from a screw on the box matched that found on a glass in the Munich penthouse of a wealthy woman who was brutally murdered there in May 2006. But the police excitement about a breakthrough was short-lived. On trial for the Munich killing was the victim’s nephew, who was only a few years old when Ursula was kidnapped. After extensive forensic investigations, the judges ruled that no link could be established between the two criminal cases, and the nephew was convicted for the Munich murder. How the match with the sample from the Herrmann case occurred remains a mystery – though very rare, mistakes do occur in genetic profiling.For the prosecutors looking at the Herrmann case, time was running out. Her death had not been deemed a murder, but rather kidnapping with deadly consequences, a crime that carried a 30-year statute of limitations. In five years, the people responsible would be in the clear. The state prosecutors went back to the 1980s case files, to look at the main suspects. Klaus Pfaffinger, the unemployed man who briefly claimed to have dug the hole, was dead. But Werner Mazurek was still alive, and living with his wife in the north of Germany, where he ran a boat accessories businesses and, with a friend on Tuesday evenings, a snack bar that bore the advertising slogan: “Norbert’s pig and Werner’s beer, the finest at the harbour pier”.In 2007, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and an undercover officer deployed to befriend him. Police planted recording devices in his car and his house, and tapped his phone. In October that year, his home was searched and he was asked to provide a saliva sample. It did not match any of the genetic profiles found on the box.The prosecutors had one hope left. Among the items taken from Mazurek’s house during the search was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. In the calls to Ursula’s parents in the days after her disappearance, the kidnappers had played a jingle. Was it possible that this device was used to record that jingle from the radio all those years ago? A sound expert, who had access to the original recordings of the 1981 calls, spent months conducting tests on the tape recorder, concluding that it was indeed used in the kidnapping.On 28 May 2008, nearly 27 years after Ursula’s death, Mazurek was arrested and flown to Augsburg, a city near Eching. Ursula’s parents, who were still living in the same house by the Ammersee, had been notified a few days before that an arrest was imminent. They were also told they could be part of the trial. Under the German legal system, relatives of the victims of certain serious crimes are allowed to formally join the prosecution as nebenklage, or co-plaintiffs. This gives them the right to view the evidence, request witnesses and put questions to the judges.Ursula’s parents did not want to be confronted again by the horrifying details of their daughter’s death, all these years later. Instead, it was agreed that the co-plaintiff would be their oldest son, Michael, who was by then in his 40s, teaching religion and music at a girls’ secondary school in Augsburg. He was a quiet, family man, but also one who is “not content with half-truths”, as his old friend Michael Hofstetter, who was with him in Eching on the evening Ursula disappeared, recently told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “He has such a very deep sense of justice that drives him.”The trial opened in February 2009 before a packed court in Augsburg. Mazurek, characterised in one newspaper as a “bearded giant”, sat in front of his wife, who was also on trial as an accessory to the crime. Reading from a 20-page statement, Mazurek insisted he was innocent. “I know I was certainly not a good citizen, sometimes rude, and we’ll see many attempts to portray me as a bad person. But I have nothing to do with this act.”The prosecution had no difficulty finding evidence of his poor character. Mazurek’s daughter and stepson had few good things to say about him as a father. He had also had other scrapes with the law, including a fraud conviction in 2004 for falsifying documents. Then there was the story about the dog. In 1974, Mazurek returned from the Oktoberfest beer festival to find that the family dog, a mixed-breed named Susi, had overturned the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Mazurek grabbed the dog and locked it in the basement freezer. The next day his wife at the time, who would soon orce him, went to the freezer to get some meat only to discover Susi there, frozen to death. Mazurek later said he had punished the pet “with exile to Siberia”.The prosecution laid out the circumstantial evidence against Mazurek. He had a motive as he needed the money, and the means to secretly build a box, because he owned a workshop. While Ursula was missing he had been observed listening to police radio, and a piece of leather used in the box construction was cut from a belt owned by someone with a large stomach, like Mazurek. And, in 2007, after police searched and bugged his house, they listened in on a phone call between him and an old friend from Eching where they discussed the statute of limitations for the Ursula Herrmann case.But the key elements of the prosecutors’ case were the revoked confession by Pfaffinger – that he dug the hole at Mazurek’s request – and the tape recorder. They insisted the confession was credible. As the old police files showed, Pfaffinger’s confession was accurate in several ways: he had described the burial site in detail, from the size of the forest glade and the dimensions of the hole to the soil conditions. The lead police investigator in 1982 was convinced Pfaffinger deliberately misled him during the forest visit, when he could not locate where the box was buried. Testifying in court, all these years later, the same policeman described Pfaffinger as an “excellent actor and practised swindler”.The tape recorder was the most important, and controversial, piece of evidence. When questioned by police in 2007, Mazurek said he had purchased it only a few weeks earlier, at a flea market while on a short holiday with his wife. But he could not prove who sold it to him, and nobody at the market could recall such a device being on sale that day. The state’s expert, whose speciality was phonetics rather than audio, described how, in the recording of the ransom calls, you could hear a couple of clicking sounds – the buttons of a tape recorder being pressed during the recording of the jingle. When she pressed the buttons on the tape machine, she had, in her words, an “aha” moment. The sounds were identical. Other subtle characteristics of the recording also corresponded precisely to the specific machine in front of her. It was, she said, “probable” that the very same tape recorder found in Mazurek’s house was used in the ransom calls.Summing up, in March 2010, the senior prosecutor reminded the court that Ursula had been “buried alive in a box”, revealing the “cold-bloodedness and mercilessness of the perpetrator”. The three judges and two jurors were convinced, finding Mazurek guilty and sentencing him to life imprisonment. His wife was acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In court, everyone seemed happy that Ursula’s killer had finally been put away. Everyone, that is, except one person.At the start of the trial, few people in court had taken much notice of Michael Herrmann. Despite his distinctive appearance – he wears his grey hair in a ponytail and at the time also sported thin sideburns down to his jaw – he is unassuming, not the kind of man who draws attention to himself. After graduating from high school, he studied teaching in Augsburg, and then opened a music store, selling instruments and equipment, including tape recorders. He got married, had three children and fostered a fourth. He loved watching them grow up, seeing them share his love of music, finding their own way in life.People who knew what happened to Ursula sometimes asked if it made Michael anxious about his own kids, but for some reason it didn’t. Nor did he ever think about looking for the perpetrators himself that was the job of the police. Though he felt at peace in his life, his sister’s death still felt to him like an “unclosed circle”. The trial, and his status as a co-plaintiff, offered an opportunity to close it. While most nebenklage are passive observers in court, Michael decided to take his role far more seriously. He would not allow the family to be victims a second time.Before the trial started, to the surprise of his state-assigned lawyer, Michael had requested full access to the case files, which ran into tens of thousands of scanned pages. In the first few weeks of the trial he got through 6,000 pages, locking himself in the study at home at night, unable to stop reading. His memories of Ursula were strong: he recalled how, despite her liveliness, she was also cautious and at times sensitive, growing upset when some of her schoolmates repeatedly misbehaved. But reading through the typewritten police reports he realised he had forgotten many of the details of the horrifying days in September 1981, even the fact that he had helped Ursula with her piano practice just a few hours before she was kidnapped. It was, he felt, like his brain has somehow blanked out that part of his life. To Michael, there was much to suggest Mazurek might have committed the crime, but there were also things that troubled him about the prosecution case. He could not understand why Pfaffinger’s revoked confession was now being treated as plausible, when it was dismissed all those years before. From the police files it was clear that Pfaffinger had a serious alcohol problem. While in detention he claimed to have experienced hallucinations. He was also chronically work-shy questioned in 2008, his former wife called him a “lazy guy” who would never have agreed to dig a large hole.As the court heard, Pfaffinger’s confession was not even signed the investigator wrote it down from memory weeks later. And, as with Mazurek, there was no DNA proof connecting Pfaffinger to the crime. Before the trial, the police exhumed Pfaffinger’s body but there was no match to the genetic profiles they had discovered among the evidence a few years before.Most concerning to Michael was the tape recorder. With his background in music, he knew a lot about acoustics and sound engineering, and could not understand how a tape recorder could be definitively linked to the ransom calls all those years ago. Even if the reel-to-reel device had been used to record the jingle from the radio, as the prosecution alleged, the kidnappers would still have had to transfer that recording to a second, more portable device, since the calls to the Herrmann house were made from pay phones. The acoustic environments in the booth and at the kidnapper’s home would also have influenced what the police eventually heard and recorded at the other end of the phone line.Michael’s lawyer advised him not to make a big deal out of it. “She said: ‘you don’t do this as a nebenklage’. But I did not think about habits, I just did what I thought was right,” Michael told me. He wrote a letter to the court, calling the sound expert’s report about the tape recorder “incomplete or one-sided”. The judges were not happy, but by law they were obliged to read out the letter in court. It was a highly unusual and sensational intervention – a member of the prosecution team, the victim’s brother, no less, acting in favour of the defence. When the verdict against Mazurek was announced, Michael made a statement at the courthouse. “I am not convinced of his guilt,” he said. “But neither am I convinced of his innocence.” Instead of the circle being closed, it had opened further.Six months after the trial, in late 2010, Michael began to notice a strange, high frequency noise in his left ear. At night the hissing would wake him up and prevent him falling back asleep. Even worse, it often tormented him during the day, especially when was he trying to teach music. He had never experienced tinnitus before, and thought it might relate to the trial. The court-appointed psychologist, on hand to assist relatives of crime victims, examined him and agreed that the stress of the court case was indeed the likely cause.By then, Michael was increasingly sceptical that Mazurek was guilty. After the trial ended, Michael kept returning, night after night, his ear ringing, to the case files, which he had stored on his computer, meticulously arranging the evidence in folders. It had put strain on his marriage – he separated from his wife in 2012 – but he could not let it go. He felt he owed it to his parents, to himself, even to the German public, to pursue the truth. “What drives me is ethics – doing what is morally right,” he told me. “It was just wrong for the case to end like it did.”So he came up with a plan. In 2013, he filed a civil claim, seeking €20,000 in damages from Mazurek for causing his tinnitus. It was a legal ruse: since Mazurek would defend the case on the basis that he was wrongfully convicted and so could not be considered responsible, the court would have to reconsider the facts of the criminal trial before coming to a conclusion. It would be an opportunity, Michael believed, “to get nearer to the truth”.“The judges knew what was going on, and they were pissed off,” Joachim Feller, who has been Michael’s lawyer since 2012, told me when we met at his offices in Landsberg am Lech, an ancient town about 20 minutes drive from Eching. “They tried several times to stop it going forward.” The court insisted that an independent psychiatrist examine Michael, and to rule on whether his tinnitus was caused by the trial. After the psychiatrist confirmed it was, the case finally went ahead in 2016. It dragged on for more than two years.Unlike with the criminal trial, where the media focus was on Mazurek, it was now on Michael. He found himself having to explain to his pupils in his music and religion classes, who knew him as a reserved, kind teacher, why they were seeing his face in the newspapers and on TV. He took journalists to Eching, and into the forest where Ursula was kidnapped. Even so, apart from Herrmann’s close family and friends, few understood why he was pursuing the case. A local journalist who covered the criminal and civil cases told me his newsroom colleagues often asked him why Herrmann “could not just let it go”. “I myself am still trying to work out why Michael Herrmann is acting like this,” the journalist said. “He is quiet and calm, but still he looks into the files … There is a little obsession.”As the civil trial went on, it became clear that he was not the only person with doubts about the original verdict. Appearing for the defence was a retired physicist and amateur sound expert named Bernd Haider, who had built his first tape recorder from scratch in the 1960s and lived in a village just a few miles from Eching. He vividly remembered the coverage of the crime from 1981, though he had never heard of Mazurek before his arrest. Haider had followed the 2009 trial in the media and, like Michael, was highly sceptical about the tape-recorder evidence. Later, he had borrowed a similar machine, got hold of the ransom call recordings, and tried to see if it was possible to replicate the phonetic expert’s findings. After a year of testing, he concluded it was not, and offered his assistance to Mazurek’s lawyer.When I visited Haider this spring, the borrowed tape recorder was still in his loft. After a lunch of wiener schnitzel and potatoes, he told me: “Michael Herrmann was the only person in the original trial who understood what the problem with this evidence was. He said ‘it’s impossible’, but he was sitting on the wrong side of the court!”Towards the end of the civil case, Michael gained another ally. In London, a German academic named Barbara Zipser read an article online about his efforts to get to the truth. Zipser was a child in Germany when Ursula was kidnapped, and recalled the horror she felt then. In terms of its impact, it was the German equivalent of the Madeleine McCann case, Zipser told me when we met this year. “I thought: whoever did this, I want that person in jail,” she said.Since Zipser’s speciality is linguistic profiling – at Royal Holloway, University of London, she uses modern profiling techniques to identify authors of ancient Greek medical texts – she decided to compare the ransom notes sent by the kidnappers to samples of Mazurek’s writing, which Haider had posted on the internet. Zipser analysed the words used, and the writing style. Whoever composed the ransom notes was well educated, she said, a native speaker pretending to be a foreigner by writing in broken German. “I am sure it was not Mazurek,” Zipser told me.In August 2018, the civil case concluded and the court ordered Mazurek to pay Michael €7,000 for causing his tinnitus. It was a victory that to Michael represented a loss, since to arrive at the decision the judges first needed to agree with the criminal court that Mazurek, together with an unidentified accomplice, was indeed the man who had kidnapped Ursula.In an open letter to the Bavarian state and the media, Michael wrote: “My sister’s fate has stayed with me for 37 years, and to this day, it is unclear who was actually responsible for her death. Could it be that the Augsburg legal system is not actually interested in solving the case of Ursula Herrmann, the death of my little sister? … If the court decides to close the proverbial lid, it should be well aware that one cannot shut the truth away.”Since Mazurek was arrested in 2008, he has been represented by Walter Rubach, one of Bavaria’s best-known defence lawyers. Rubach sees things in black and white. If a client asks him whether he believes in their innocence – as Mazurek did in 2008 – he brushes away the question. “I told him I don’t believe any of my clients,” Rubach told me in his chambers in Augsburg. “My job is to work out if there’s enough proof and evidence to convict them.” In Mazurek’s case he was convinced from the start that there wasn’t.“It was clear that Mazurek was a person who could have committed something like that. But there were no hard facts – it was a circumstantial case at its finest,” Rubach said. “I am still upset at how he was convicted. What is it you say in England? Rather let 10 guilty men go free than hang one innocent one.”Though Rubach has had little personal interaction with Michael, he has watched him across the court, and likes and admires him. “What he has done, as a co-plaintiff, going against the decision of a court – this never happened before in Germany.”From his prison cell in Germany’s far north, Mazurek is still trying to clear his name. After I wrote to him this year, he replied saying he had hired a private investigator to track down the man who he says sold him the tape recorder in 2007. “I am just angry and I am awaiting the 11th anniversary of my time in jail,” he wrote.On a mild Sunday morning in April, I met Michael in Augsburg. As he had been most days in court, he was dressed casually, in trainers, blue jeans and a black jacket. Despite his legal setbacks, and the tinnitus that continues to bother him, he comes across as calm and warm, and possesses a dry sense of humour. As we drove through the Bavarian countryside towards Eching, he tried to explain the meaning of überfordert, the word he used to describe the police in 1981: “It means when the task you have is bigger than your capabilities – like Brexit.”Michael knows the case material so well – he has put in far more hours of research than any of the lawyers for the defence or prosecution – that when he speaks, it is with the precision and detachment of a special investigator, rather than a relative. After parking the car beside the road between Eching and Schondorf, he noted it was probably where the kidnappers had parked when bringing the box to the forest. An SUV track led into the woods. “We need to walk 141 metres,” Michael said, and then look 20 metres to the left, to locate the spot where Ursula was buried. “We don’t know if she was sedated and carried or if she was forced to walk there,” he said. “But we know she was taken on paths specially cut through the forest.”Michael’s father died several years ago, and in 2016 his mother moved out of the family home in the village to Augsburg. But his younger brother Hannes – the surfer – still lives in the house, along with two Syrian refugees who rent out the bottom floor. Michael phoned him – he did not want to show up with a journalist, unannounced – and Hannes invited us in for coffee. We never spoke about Ursula. As with his oldest sister and their mother, Hannes has never talked to the media about his sister’s death, though Michael says that in private his family supports his work on the case, as do his children and his new partner. But in public, at least, he is alone in his quest to reopen the case.After lunch at a restaurant beside the lake, where sailboats bobbed in the distance, we walked along the road towards the forest, the route Ursula took on her way to gym class nearly 40 years ago. The spruce trees are much taller than they were then, and the undergrowth less thick, but the path is the same: three metres wide, compact gravel. Cyclists on electric bikes sped by.After a few minutes, as we neared a small jetty leading to a wooden hut used by bathers, Michael stopped on the path. “This is where Ursula was kidnapped,” he said. “It’s where her bike was found and where the bell-wire ended.” The bell-wire is the 140m-long coil of insulated copper wire the kidnappers used as part of a warning system. Though the police had noticed the wire while searching for Ursula, they only learned of its significance more than a year later, when investigators visited the private boarding school in Schondorf to talk to pupils about the case. Two students came forward, saying that seven or eight months after the kidnapping, when chasing an owl through the forest, they had found the bell-wire strung through the trees next to the lakeside path. The boys then did a very strange thing: they took the wire down, measured it on the school athletics track, and then kept it in their dormitory in a locked box, until the police visit.On examining the wire, the investigators realised it must have been used during Ursula’s abduction. While one of the kidnappers waited for the victim, the other presumably served as a lookout further along the path, with their finger on a button that would light up a bulb or sound a buzzer at the other end of the wire.Michael believes the wire is one of the key pieces of evidence that could help identify the real kidnappers. Besides hunters, joggers and cyclists, the boarding school pupils also knew the forest well. Yet it appears that none of them were fingerprinted at the time of the investigation. Another piece of evidence also hints at the possible involvement of younger people in the plot: an impression on the paper of one of the ransom notes revealed a mathematical probability tree, of the sort taught to teenagers. Michael also notes that in a comic found in the box, one of the main characters drives a Fiat 600, the car that was mentioned in the ransom note and which was rare in Germany at the time, suggesting the kidnappers may have read the comic.Late last year, in an effort to have the case reopened, Michael submitted a dossier of all his new evidence and theories to the state prosecutor’s office in Augsburg. In April, when I interviewed Matthias Nickolai, spokesman for the public prosecutor, he acknowledged that many people still had questions about the verdict in the criminal trial, but insisted the judges had arrived at the correct decision in 2010, and that it was “final and absolute”. In August, this became official, when the prosecutor’s office announced it would not be reopening the case.Through his lawyer, Michael told the local press that he would be making no more public statements about the case, nor giving interviews, which the media interpreted as him finally giving up. But when I emailed him recently he said this was not true. “I didn’t say that I am not going to take it any further,” he wrote.On 15 September, a few days after I received that message, it was the 38th anniversary of Ursula’s kidnapping and death. As they have done for the last few years, Michael, along with his two siblings and his mother, travelled to the graveyard in Eching where Ursula is buried. Just the four of them, no partners. There they remembered the little girl who left her cousin’s house on her red bike on a summer’s evening and never came home. •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/576c48c7a2df97278856f95f9ad93d420b20f9d4/0_148_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46a732f1e266de7cfc9ffbe9bedfc00","title":"where did it all go wrong for david cameron","story":"As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron’s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise.

This was later confirmed by a Labour spokesman. “This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government’s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table,” Corbyn said.Corbyn set out his plan to win an election then negotiate a Brexit deal within three months, and hold a second referendum within six months without saying which way Labour would campaign.This appeared to squash the idea that Corbyn, as a temporary prime minister, could push for a second referendum and get Brexit sorted before a general election to focus on domestic issues – which is promoted by some MPs, including a few of his allies. A Labour spokesman later reiterated that the policy is election first, referendum second.Corbyn showed how he would fight an election as the anti-establishment candidate, rubbishing Johnson’s claims of being the voice of the people against parliament. “In a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson’s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people,” he said. “A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment. Johnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment they are the establishment.”Corbyn announced a major new policy of a state-owned generic drug manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to the NHS. This would stop big pharmaceutical companies charging the NHS over the odds for medicines. “We will redesign the system to serve public health – not private wealth – using compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines,” he said. “We’ll tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they’ll have to make their drugs affordable for all. And we will create a new publicly owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS, saving our health service money and saving lives.”Corbyn ran through a series of big, bold policies announced by his shadow ministers at the conference including: “Crossrail for the north” nationalising the rail, postal and water industries plus the National Grid free prescriptions free personal care for the elderly and a net-zero emissions target for 2030. The policies go even further than Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto and may come with a large price tag. But Labour is calculating that people will be won over by ideas to make their lives easier if the tax burden falls on the very wealthiest and businesses. The party says its manifesto will be fully costed so the books are balanced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adff13bb6794008730a40d6804e31106066da5f5/98_12_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f48a3f39a5888032b73878d45a698e57","title":"keir starmer mixed feelings jeremy corbyn neutral brexit stance labour","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary says he is disappointed Labour rejected move to back remainThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has said he is disappointed Labour members rejected efforts to make the party one that formally backs remain and has “mixed feelings” on Jeremy Corbyn staying neutral on the issue.His remarks come as concerns continue over the way a vote to determine the party’s stance on Brexit was held at Labour’s party conference in Brighton.The close-run vote among delegates was orchestrated through a show of hands rather than a card vote, which some members feel would have given a more accurate result.Speaking to the political website Politico, Starmer said: “I have said for some time, over and over again, that I would campaign for remain, so obviously I am disappointed by the result. But we had a vote – that is what the Labour party does.”The former director of public prosecutions said he believed Labour voters wanted the party to campaign for remain should there be another referendum, adding it was “obvious” where the membership was on the issue.Corbyn’s decision to avoid personally giving a judgment on Brexit during an expected general election campaign was also criticised by his shadow cabinet colleague.“I have got mixed feelings about that. I personally think it is far better to say campaign to remain, and that is what I have said … I don’t think there is a deal that is going to be as good as the deal we have got.”His colleague and former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a remain campaigner, suggested to Radio 4’s Today programme that the vote in conference to decide on the party’s Brexit stance had been confusing and muddled.The chair of Labour’s ruling body, the national executive committee (NEC), Wendy Nichols, told delegates she thought the vote had gone one way while suggesting the general secretary, Jennie Formby, who was sitting next to her, “said something else”. She then announced that the “back remain now” motion had lost.Beckett said: “I thought the vote was quite close and the process seemed a little bit muddled from the perspective of somebody who wasn’t on the stage and that’s a pity because that always adds to confusion.”The chances are the result will be challenged, she added.She said: “One of the features of a Labour party conference over the years is whatever happens is likely to be challenged by somebody. But whether that will be serious is another matter.”The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, defended Nichols’s chairing of the vote, describing her as “very capable”.“If she had any problems with the decision and the vote yesterday I am under no illusion that she would have called the vote again, and she didn’t. And it was on national television so I think it’s clear to see how the room voted,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The party’s position is to stay neutral on Brexit in a general election, but pledge a second referendum. It would then want to renegotiate a deal with Brussels and give voters the option of choosing either that deal or remaining. It would then determine its position on how to campaign in that referendum after a one-day conference.She said: “There are a lot of people who just want us to get a good deal and they want the opportunity to put this matter to bed.“We are all fed up. It’s making us all ill. Industry is stagnating and it’s got to be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.“That’s why we want the public to have the final say.”She said the controversial motion voted on by the NEC to remove the deputy leader, Tom Watson, which rocked the first 24 hours of the conference, had come as a “total shock” and “nobody knew that was coming”.Tom Watson, who has been Labour’s deputy leader since 2015, has been an MP since 2001. The 52-year-old served as a minister in the Labour government and was appointed the deputy chair of the NEC by Ed Miliband.Watson stepped in to personally handle complaints in the midst of Labour’s antisemitism crisis. He backed automatic exclusion of members accused of anti-Jewish racism.Earlier this year, Watson called on centrist MPs to stay and fight within the Labour party, putting an end to rumours he would lead a split of centrist Labour MPs.In his speech earlier this month, Watson said his party must “unambiguously and unequivocally back remain” in a second referendum, a move that Jeremy Corbyn believes to be the wrong approach.\u0026nbspAs well as regularly being in conflict with the Labour leadership, Watson has had a long-running feud with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Labour’s biggest donor. The pair, who were once close friends, have clashed over Corbyn’s leadership and Brexit.Watson said he was in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester when he heard of the motion to scrap his position within the Labour party. He described the move as a “straight sectarian attack on a broad church party”, adding it was “a sort of sleight of hand of constitutional change to do a drive-by shooting of someone you disagree with on the issue of the day.”In the meeting she voted in favour of having a debate about whether the motion on the future of the deputy role could be discussed or not.She said: “I don’t want to stifle democracy,” adding: “I don’t think that it’s helpful at the beginning of a Labour party conference to have such drama if I’m honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b029eaf073fab5d0d5e540e1cc8c4b8a4ea375/0_120_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dcd77b118cde783d158b7c16de3276a","title":"labours climate policies what are they and what do they mean","story":"The party trumpets a ‘green industrial revolution’ that unions back as a ‘just transition’What is the “green industrial revolution”?The Labour party’s answer to the climate emergency is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in new industries and reforms to existing practices, to generate economic opportunities, particularly in areas where old industrial jobs have vanished. The ideas behind it are similar to those of the international move for a Green New Deal, espoused by leading Democrats in the US, but draw on the UK’s specific industrial resources, skills and heritage.What measures have been announced?On Monday, a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points, to ensure rapid refuelling for long and short journeys. There will also be interest-free loans for electric car buyers, with the aim of electric vehicles making up two-thirds of those on UK roads by 2030. Energy generation is another key target: home insulation and solar panels will be introduced free for more than a million people in low-income and social housing. If elected, a Labour government would renationalise the electricity grid, with a national energy agency and regional agencies taking over the task of delivering energy and balancing demand, while suppliers would remain private. Labour would also ban fracking.What other measures are likely?Labour will announce plans to remove planning restrictions that stop onshore windfarms. A large proportion of the proposed £250bn national transformation fund will be spent on the “green industrial revolution”, in ways yet to be laid out in detail. Additional Treasury policies could include adjusting the discount rate to make investments in green measures cheaper and changes to tax. Public procurement would be reformed so that suppliers to the public sector have to meet stringent green standards. And there may be a move to bring forward the government’s current target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, enacted by Theresa May.What will this mean for jobs?Labour claims the measures will create tens of thousands of new jobs around the country, and unions are broadly in favour, backing a “just transition” from high-carbon industries to a low-carbon economy that would create high-quality jobs to replace those lost in industries such as coal.How is this being received?There is support among party members, with Labour for a Green New Deal and Momentum backing the idea, and it seems to play well among young people in particular. Businesses seem more wary, with the CBI telling the  that “renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions”.Will Brexit have an impact?Plans for green industry are being presented as separate to Brexit, representing a way forward that all sides of the Brexit debate can espouse, as they are targeted at new green jobs and an industrial revival. But a close relationship with Europe is viewed as essential, to collaborate on green standards and carbon accounting. The UK will host the major UN climate conference in 2020, called COP26, so Labour would seek to showcase the “green industrial revolution” on the international stage if in power next December.What about aviation?One key issue that must be addressed is the forecast rapid rise in emissions from aviation, and Labour has been ided over a new runway at Heathrow, in contrast to the Liberal Democrats who want a moratorium on all airport expansion. Improved and cheaper public transport is key to Labour plans: the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, pointed to flights within the UK that are much cheaper than rail journeys as one target for action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d453da908f7bc07e240695451f35bb7e60948e/1367_3633_2460_1476/master/2460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08aa5ddd7d1ddff598f80b0194bf28ee","title":"councils investing in quality homes","story":"Local authorities are increasingly building smart, environmentally friendly and beautifully designed homesTheir new houses may have won national media praise, been lauded by industry experts and even made the shortlist of the Royal Institute of British Architects’ (Riba) Stirling Prize. But for Norwich council, it’s the reaction from the residents on Goldsmith Street that has marked its 100 newly built homes as a success. “I was overwhelmed when I was told the property was mine. I simply couldn’t believe my luck,” says one resident. “Since moving and settling in, my life is barely recognisable. It feels like the fresh start and new beginning that I needed.”With intelligently designed streets, and patches of grass for children to play on, this energy-efficient development in Norwich – rented out by the council with secure tenancies at fixed rents – exemplifies the smart, environmentally friendly and beautifully designed homes now being built in greater numbers by local authorities.A combination of events, including the lifting of financial restrictions in 2018, has led to a resurgence of council house-building unheard of since the 1980s.Riba’s own research on the characteristics of places where people want to live includes case studies of mixed tenures, from Cambridge, York, Salford and Essex, among others. Good design is key – a plan for the right housing in the right place, with good access to local services a variety of housing types to create an integrated, erse community a design that creates a sense of ownership and belonging and qualities that make residents feel at home, such as effective noise insulation, good levels of natural light and room proportions, access to green space, and efficient use of fuel.In Hackney, the award-winning renovation of the King’s Crescent estate was led by the council’s in-house architect, Ken Rorrison. Three new towers were built and existing properties were upgraded: ground-floor garages and winter gardens were converted into new flats. Underpasses where residents felt unsafe were eliminated, and three new courtyards for communal use were built. Making all homes the same, whether they are social or private housing, has also been important, says Rorrison, even down to using the same materials. This has not always been a given until recently, social tenants could be forced to use separate entrances, and their children could be excluded from communal play areas, although the Greater London Authority has now banned this practice.“Everybody benefits from decent space standards, good ceiling heights, high levels of daylight, usable public spaces, and that balance of privacy and communality,” says Rorrison. “That’s universal and isn’t about whether someone’s a social tenant or private tenant.”Abigail Batchelor, an associate at architects Karakusevic Carson, says she starts every new project by taking a walking tour with locals. She finds people love older social homes. “They’re very bright, they’ve got good balconies, they’re really well lit and they have generous space.”The issues residents raise with her are more often about the journey from the street to their front door, with routes that don’t support safe walking and cycling, unwelcoming communal spaces, and landscaping that doesn’t prioritise health and wellbeing. By learning from the mistakes of the past, she adds, good design can help create good communities for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c00ea76b931cbdc6c6bdc3408fce55b666cddb72/0_117_3413_2047/master/3413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45eeae85b478482636591db350d61dbd","title":"scott fardy tsunami kamaishi rugby world cup","story":"Kamaishi is a steel town. The first things you see when you arrive here are the large corrugated warehouses of the Nippon Steel factory, the smoke rising from the blast furnaces and, beyond them, a spaghetti mess of pipelines and conveyor belts, roads and bridges across the river that runs down to the port where the tugboats and tankers moor. At the end of it all is the great new blue sea wall, and beyond that, the sparkling ocean. Fifty years ago, around 75,000 people lived here then Nippon Steel scaled back production, and now there are only 35,000. Even before the tsunami, the place was in a slump.So was Scott Fardy when he first came here. Years later, Fardy would become a star of the 2015 Wallabies team that made it to the World Cup final. But this was in 2009. He was 24, and he had just been let go by the Western Force without playing a single game for them all season. He couldn’t get a job in Super Rugby. “My manager told me there was one club left, right up in the north of Japan,” he says. They were called the Kamaishi Seawaves, and they were playing in the second ision of Japan’s eastern conference. “What do you think?” Fardy signed up for 12 months.Once, Kamaishi were the best team in Japan. Between 1979 and 1985 they won the national championship seven years in a row. Back then, like most other rugby clubs in Japan, they were owned and run by the local corporation. They were called Nippon Steel Kamaishi, but everyone knew them as the Iron Men of the North. Because the factory and the rugby club were intertwined, and when Nippon Steel moved away the team fell down the leagues. In 2001 Nippon Steel handed control of the club over to the town and they became the Kamaishi Seawaves.The Seawaves are unique among Japan’s top two isions: they are the only club owned and run by a community, rather than a company. “When I was here I think there were 15 guys who worked at Nippon Steel, and the rest of the guys worked at different businesses around town,” Fardy says. “The captain sold office furniture, a couple of guys were in the town hall, a couple more were in security, another guy was a courier driver, a lot of the rest worked down the docks.” Japan isn’t a rugby country, but this little corner of it is. It got under his skin, and he ended up staying for three years.It was in the third year that the tsunami hit. Fardy’s house was far enough inland that he was safe. The first he heard about it was when he saw “all the guys coming back from the factory saying ‘the tsunami has destroyed the town’”. Later, he went to look for himself, to check on friends of his who lived over the hill in Omachi. “It looked like the end of days,” he says. “Everything was flattened, gone, there was a big gas fire, and everything was burned out, it was incredibly distressing. Something I never want to see again.”In the days afterwards, Fardy wasn’t sure what to do. “We didn’t know whether we should get out or not, because all the supermarkets were gone, everything was gone and we were eating supplies, and it felt like we were doing the wrong thing.” Five days later the Australian embassy offered to fly him and the team’s other overseas players home. “I told them: ‘I’m going to stay.’ The wives and children went home, but we wanted to do what we could to help the town.” For the next few days, he and his teammates worked at the supply depot, unloading trucks, stacking supplies, distributing bags of rice.“Rugby has values, like being a team, working hard, not letting your mates down,” Fardy says. He doesn’t want any credit for it. “The whole community was out there doing it as a team, together, there were hundreds of people doing amazing work, much more than what we were doing. There were people picking up bodies, and digging up bodies.”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIt turned out that the best thing the Seawaves could do for the town was to get back playing. “The people wanted us to start again,” he says. “I think sport was a great way for people to get back to normality. They can go and watch a game, and get away from what’s happening, get a bit of relief. We felt like we had a duty to do it, to go out and play well for the town.” They played a full season in the year of the tsunami, in front of some of the largest crowds they’d had since the team won the championship.Kamaishi is a rugby town. You can see it in the flags, posters and murals that are on every lamppost, noticeboard and spare patch of wall, in the gruff taxi driver who presses a handful of sweets on you and tells you to enjoy the game, the convenience store clerk who comes running up to shout “Thank you very much!” in English as you’re on your way out of the shop, and the three old ladies at the corner table in the cafe, folding thousands of origami cranes from little paper flags of the four countries playing games here. No town was ever happier to host a World Cup match.These days the general manager of the Seawaves is Yoshihiko Sakuraba, who played for the team in the last of their glory years. “It’s not just that the people are happy to have the World Cup here,” he explains, “it’s that they want to thank the world for all the support and aid they gave us after the tsunami. These World Cup matches are their way of giving back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea50b81df415d39aa4b0ea9b8941edeef0840311/960_683_2261_1357/master/2261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b08548117a0b213fa48005ab62b391e8","title":"michael leitch japan rugby world cup yamanote high vea taumoefolau","story":"Stumbling blind through suburbs of Sapporo, following a sketchy set of directions from a stranger who took pity on me, I find a 6ft x 10ft picture of Japan’s captain, Michael Leitch, scoring a try in that famous game against the Springboks in 2015. It is posted above a set of double doors set in what looks like another office block. This must be the place. And around the side of the building, in a muddy yard surrounded by a chain fence, 15 kids are running passing drills and, in the far corner, 15 more working a scrum machine. This is Yamanote High, the best rugby school in all Hokkaido, one of the most famous in all Japan.“Up here,” says Vea Taumoefolau, “as soon as you say ‘Yamanote’, people will say ‘rugby’.” Vea is the school’s big, warm, softly spoken No 8. In 2016 he found two Japanese scouts waiting for him outside his house in Auckland. They had seen him playing for his school under‑15s and wanted to offer him a scholarship in Japan. Vea had never even been so far away as Wellington and he already had a place lined up at Mount Albert Grammar, one of the strongest rugby schools in New Zealand. “It was pretty far out there,” he says. “But I decided I wanted to try something new.” Besides, “Tokyo was on my bucket list of places to go.”Yamanote used to be better known for women’s basketball. A teacher, Mikio Sato, set up a rugby club only to give the drop-outs something to do. At first he had to offer free ramen to get them to come to training. In their first three years the club won one game. Things started to change in 2004, when Leitch came over from New Zealand on a school exchange. He was 15, too.“Leitch was a very shy boy,” says the current coach, Hironori Kuroda. He points to the horizon, which is dominated by a short, steep pyramid mountain called Sankakuyama. “He used to run up that every day, after training,” Kuroda says, full of admiration. Vea sighs wearily. “It’s so steep you have to do some of it on your hands and feet.” It takes the boys about 30 minutes to make that run. By the end of his time here Leitch used to do it in 15. “The mountain was his playground.”“Leitch put Yamanote on the map,” says Vea. “A lot of the kids here came to play for us just because this was his school.” Vea wants to go on and play for Japan too, just like Leitch. He has already played for the national U18 team. First he has to finish his business with Yamanote. They have the national championships, Hanazono, in December.Vea is not the only foreign player here. His cousin, Stefarhn Vahafolau, plays full-back and their fly-half, Ashden Ewens, has come over from New Zealand too. They say the game is faster here but more skilful there. They all agree that the biggest difference is how much harder the kids work in Japan. “They take everything way more seriously than we do in New Zealand,” says Ewens. “In New Zealand we were training twice a week. Here we’re training every day of the week except Monday.” Vea is in the gym by six every morning for a 90-minute workout, then he has seven hours of school and, after that, another three or four hours of rugby training.They are burning a lot of calories. “Usually we have three bowls of rice and three chicken breasts for breakfast, with soup, water and milk, then more rice and chicken breast for lunch,” says Vea. “Then dinner is a meal called viking, where we have whatever we want, fried chicken, fried rice.” He sighs again. “I’m on the heavy side, though. I was 130kg when I came here and I’m trying to get down to 110kg, so I have to skip that. What I have is a lot of salad and fish.”Vea had never seen snow till he arrived in Sapporo. He got sick the first week because he could not stand the cold. The culture took some getting used to, too. “In New Zealand you sometimes see teachers as your friends. Here you have to talk to them in a very formal way. I feel like my neck is bent from bowing morning to night.” It’s not just the teachers. “In New Zealand all the players are treated the same but here they have a system called senpai-kohai, senior-junior, which means you have to do what the older boys tell you to do. It makes it very hard to communicate with them on the field.”Japan can be a hard place for a foreigner, especially out here in the suburbs. People tend to duck out of his way when they see him coming. “But it’s not so bad. At least I can always get to what I want in the shop when I’m in a rush,” he laughs. “And I’m glad I came, there are so many opportunities for me here,” Vea says.He is a senior himself now, a leader in the team and around the school. That was part of the deal. His time here has not just been about what he could learn from the Japanese but what he could teach them. “They’re always asking me, why are the All Blacks so good?” he says. “These guys are scared of foreigners. They were scared of me and Ashden the first time they saw us. I tell them, ‘We’re all just people, with the same skin and bone.’” He says their other problem is that “they don’t know that we can’t carry the team by ourselves. We have to have them to help us.”This year Vea wants to teach them brotherhood, get them to see each other as family, rather than friends. “I want to persuade them that instead of always doing things the Japanese way they could use a little bit of the New Zealand way too,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b18053e1f1251cb161341c2ba476c433a19e870/204_387_5221_3133/master/5221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83d68722cc655f738d40169f673a5b1","title":"dance taiwan cloud gate lin hwai min","story":"Lin Hwai-min has spent 46 years tackling revolt, repression and rice in his fast-changing homeland. Now he is handing over his dance-theatre juggernaut to a former slipper sellerIt’s a hot, humid evening and I’m sitting on the ground with around 50,000 other people, all about to watch Cloud Gate Dance Theatre give its annual outdoor performance in Taipei. The atmosphere in Liberty Plaza is extraordinary. I can’t think of another dance company in the world that could draw so large and so festive a crowd. Most of the audience have brought picnics, many enduring a day of rainstorms to bag a position close to the stage. Yet, although this is a special performance – one of the last before Cloud Gate’s founding director Lin Hwai-min steps down – such devotion has been normal for the company almost since it was formed.Cloud Gate was named as the outstanding company at the British National Dance awards last year and is a headline attraction of the new Sadler’s Wells season. Lin’s success in turning a small experimental dance company into a national icon and international brand is a remarkable story. Now 71, with a fierce energy and a huge crinkled smile, Lin acknowledges that he had almost no experience of professional dance when he staged his first programme back in 1973, and discovered that he’d sold 3,000 tickets for just two shows. “I almost had a nervous breakdown,” he says. “I thought, ‘My god, now I have to learn how to choreograph.’”In the south of Taiwan, where Lin grew up, there had been very little dance to see. At the age of five he fell in love with the film The Red Shoes but nine years later, when he took his first ballet class, it proved a huge disappointment: “I had a book, All You Need to Know About Ballet, and I could tell that the teacher wasn’t doing things correctly.” Already a precociously literary teenager, inspired by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and classical Chinese poetry, Lin focused his energies on becoming a writer. By the age of 22, he’d published his first collection of short stories and had been offered a fellowship at the International Writers’ Programme in Idaho.Once he arrived in the US, though, contemporary dance grabbed his imagination. Lin was able to see the companies of Paul Taylor, Merce Cunningham and José Limón – and take classes at the Martha Graham school. He even created his first work: a tortuously complicated piece, he now realises, about “a philosopher who dreams he becomes a butterfly”. When he returned to Taipei, he was by default the local expert on contemporary dance. With musicians, dancers and artists all curious to know more, he was persuaded to set up a company.“I was stupid,” he says. “I was very young but I came from a generation who believed it was their duty to make a difference to the world.” The works Lin began to choreograph blended modern dance, classical ballet, Chinese folk dance and Chinese opera, grounded in the silken stillness of tai chi. They also drew on distinctively Taiwanese subject matter: Portrait of the Families addressed the massacre of political and intellectual dissidents under Chiang Kai-shek the pastoral masterpiece Rice evoked the rhythms and landscape of rural Taiwan.This choice of local subject matter was radical in itself: during the 28 years of Chiang’s regime, as well the Japanese rule that preceded it, the island’s language and culture had been brutally repressed. When Lin created his 1978 work Legacy, about early Taiwanese settlers, he had to stage the premiere in the south of the island, far away from the National Security Bureau in Taipei.But as challenging as those early years were, Lin says: “It is wonderful to be an artist here. In 1987, we ended martial law. In 1996, we had our first direct presidential election. Now we have a woman president and we have legalised gay marriage.” It matters profoundly to him that he has been an instrument for change, helping to found a flourishing dance department at the National Arts University and using a second company, Cloud Gate 2, to bring dance classes and performance to impoverished regions of Taiwan.The love he’s earned is palpable. Back in the early 90s, when he tried to shuck off the exhausting burden of Cloud Gate, Lin was shamed into returning by a reproachful taxi driver, who said to him: “There is hardship in every profession, Mr Lin. It is hard for me to earn a living in the traffic of Taipei. But we need Cloud Gate. So drive on.”In 2008, when the company’s rehearsal base was destroyed by a fire, Lin did not have to ask for help in building a new home: more than 4,000 people spontaneously sent donations, including one small boy who offered all of his pocket money. While others might cling on to such love, Lin is adamant that he’s “simply looking after a public property”: his final gift to Cloud Gate will be to step down at the end of this year having created as smooth a transition as possible for his successor.Lin has been mentoring Cheng Tsung-lung for years, watching him develop as a dancer and choreographer, appointing him director of Cloud Gate 2 in 2014, but he’s delighted that Cheng is a very different artist from him. “I came from a family of poets and scholars but Tsung-lung came from mud,” he says. “I envy him that.” Lin points to that fact that, while his mother made him listen to Schubert and Beethoven after school, Cheng’s parents had him working the street markets from the age of eight, selling slippers made at his father’s factory.The two men do, however, share a childhood interest in dance. Cheng, talking through a translator, says he was “a very active little boy, always bumping into things, with too much energy” and was sent to dance classes to calm down. He describes how rapidly he learned that showing off his moves in the market brought business to his stall. Even though he endured a troubled adolescence, getting involved with serious drugs and sentenced to two years’ probation and community service, Cheng continued to stick with dance.When there was a choice between going into the slipper factory or going to university, he opted to study dance at degree level. “It was the only thing I was good at,” he laughs, although he says it was only when a back injury forced him to focus temporarily on choreography that he discovered a true sense of vocation. “When I was a child, I used to make up stories about the people on the street. I didn’t have many opportunities to go to cinema, and it was like making my own films.” Once Cheng realised that creating dance was like an extension of those childhood fantasies, his work developed rapidly.Lin says it’s been one of the highlights of his career to watch Cheng mature: “He gets scared, turns into a skeleton during the creative process, but it is wonderful to see. His work is very different from mine, very dark, and he can speak to the internet generation in a way that I can’t.”13 Tongues, which Cloud Gate will bring to London next year, is typical of Cheng’s work in its fusion of local Taiwanese culture, contemporary music and a sophisticated digital sensibility. It’s a fantastical but deeply urban piece, redolent both of ancient superstitions and the clamour of modern Taipei, with black-clad dancers massing in ritualised patterns against a digitally created art work, calling out the raucous rhythmic chants of street hawkers and singing Taoist chants.Cheng, aged 43, talks and dresses like a member of modern, edgy Taipei, but he brings a very old-fashioned sense of commitment to his job: “My responsibility is about how I can keep on working for dance and connecting it with all the people here,” he says, recalling his first experiences of community work with Cloud Gate 2. “We were going into remote parts of Taiwan to help people liberate what’s inside of them, and it reminded me of when I was a child, when the street vendors would start playing their cassettes and everyone would be dancing and enjoying their bodies.”His reverence for Cloud Gate’s contribution to the island as a whole is touchingly direct. “It has brought us inspiration and dignity. At first, when people came to watch the company, they didn’t know how to behave in a public place, they didn’t know about not talking or not leaving their trash. This society loves Cloud Gate and Mr Lin – but Mr Lin has also brought society to a higher place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36c547748da29e60312c62bcaab80894537d68e/136_214_3309_1987/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49bfe7c1e2236237849e4de6eb9ecf9","title":"uber london licence transport for london","story":"Transport for London again rejects ride-hailing firm’s application for a full licenceUber’s application to renew its private hire operating licence in London has been rebuffed again by regulators.Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night.It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber’s application for a full operating licence.In September 2017, at the end if its first five-year licensing period, TfL said Uber was not a “fit and proper” firm, citing concerns including passenger safety. On appeal, Uber was granted a 15-month provisional licence.TfL said its initial decision not to licence Uber had led the firm to improve its culture and governance.A TfL spokesperson said: “Uber London Ltd has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”The two-month licence will have additional conditions attached to ensure passenger safety, covering ride-sharing, insurance and checks on driver’s documentation by Uber.The terms of the 15-month licence granted by magistrates last year will continue to apply, obliging Uber to produce an independently verified assurance report every six months, elect three non-executive directors to its board, give TfL four weeks’ notice of any changes to its operate model, and to report any potentially criminal complaints from passengers to the politan police.In July this year Uber was fined £28,800 for two counts of its drivers operating without insurance and for failing to keep proper records.Uber said it had made progress, including more checks on driver hours and additional safety measures for passengers. Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: “TfL’s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London. We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution.“We will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.”Black cab drivers said the ruling showed Uber should not be trusted by Londoners. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, said: “Granting Uber a two-month temporary licence clearly shows that the firm have failed their probation and are still a huge threat to public safety.“Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”The GMB union, which represents minicab drivers, said Uber had had “more chances than a game of Monopoly”. Steve Garelick, regional officer, criticised the decision: “A two-month licence extension is no good for anyone – it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London.”A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he backed TfL’s decision. He said: “Sadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn’t matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac40c94abcd685a259b01db9a033e1df8be845c/0_26_3831_2299/master/3831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eddd459b19e0882995af45e57077e4e0","title":"victory for google in landmark right to be forgotten case","story":"Europe’s top court says firm does not have to take sensitive information off global searchThe “right to be forgotten” online does not extend beyond the borders of the European Union, the bloc’s highest court has ruled in a major victory for Google.The right, enshrined in a 2014 legal ruling, required search engines to delete embarrassing or out-of-date information, when requested by the iniduals concerned but in a landmark ruling on Tuesday, the European court of justice said search engine operators faced no obligation to remove information outside the 28-country zone. It however said search engines must “seriously discourage” internet users from going onto non-EU versions of their pages to find that information.“The balance between right to privacy and protection of personal data, on the on hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,” the court said in a statement on the decision. The right to be forgotten was not an absolute right, the court said, and had to be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with proportionality.Privacy campaigners hailed “ a victory for global freedom of expression”, while Google welcomed the court’s decision.The case originated in a dispute between Google and the French privacy regulator CNIL, which in 2015 called for the firm to globally remove links to pages containing damaging or false information about a person.Google introduced a geo-blocking feature in 2016 following year, which stopped European users from being able to see delisted links. However, it resisted censoring search results for people in other parts of the world, challenging a €100,000 (£88,376) fine CNIL tried to impose.The technology firm argued that, if this rule were applied outside Europe, the obligation could be abused by authoritarian governments trying to cover up human rights abuses.The 2014 ruling related to a test case brought by a Spanish man after he failed to secure the deletion of an auction notice of his repossessed home dating from 1998 on a Catalan website.Google won the backing of the ECJ court adviser Maciej Szpunar earlier this year, who said the right to be forgotten should be enforced only in Europe and not globally. Judges follow such non-binding opinions in four out of five cases.The US firm was also supported by Microsoft, Wikipedia’s owner the Wikimedia Foundation, and the non-profit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, among others.Google had previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blogpost two years ago, the company said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and that no one country should be able to impose its rules on citizens of another.Responding to the judgement on Tuesday, Peter Fleischer, Google’s senior privacy counsel, said: “Since 2014, we’ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people’s rights of access to information and privacy. It’s good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.”Google and rival search engines will have to take measures, the ECJ said, to “effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage” users in the EU from using other versions of its site to access removed content.Thomas Hughes, executive director of the freedom of expression organisation Article 19, described the ruling as a victory for global freedom of expression. “Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see … It is not right that one country’s data protection authorities can impose their interpretation on Internet users around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54761697cfec24647d70410be6a8b73a0c46f9ee/0_97_5082_3049/master/5082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72218b48072ede3307f507f32334806b","title":"fleabag creator seals amazon prime deal for new show","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the latest homegrown British talent being lost to international rivalsOn Monday, she secured a mantelpiece full of Emmys on Tuesday, Phoebe Waller-Bridge got a brand new TV deal.The Fleabag creator will create and produce TV content exclusively for Amazon Prime Video, after signing a deal with Amazon Studios. The streaming service already screens Fleabag in more than 200 countries and territories including the US.“I’m insanely excited to be continuing my relationship with Amazon. Working with the team on Fleabag was the creative partnership dreams are made of. It really feels like home. I can’t wait to get going,” Waller-Bridge said as the announcement was made on Tuesday.While she emphasised the creative benefits, the news echoed growing warnings from senior UK television industry figures that homegrown British on-screen talent is increasingly being bought up by international rivals which “increasingly want to decide what we read, watch and listen to”.Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, told the Royal Television Society conference on Thursday there was a “growing concentration of power in the hands just a few tech behemoths”.She added that such firms were motivated by their own commercial interests, which might lead them to promote their own content first, “whether it’s Amazon boosting its own products on marketplace, Google prioritising its own podcasts or Netflix serving us its own productions”.That was followed by a warning from the former BBC director general, Mark Thompson, who will say the UK is facing “a total loss of culture sovereignty”.Thompson will tell an audience at the Steve Hewlett memorial lecture in London on Tuesday night: “No one wants to see the UK turn into a cultural ‘Airstrip One’, but it’s a clear and present danger. With newspapers struggling and broadcasters outgunned, I fear only effective and salient government media policy stands between Britain and a total loss of cultural sovereignty.”Fleabag and those associated with it won six awards at the Emmys, including honours for writing, directing and acting, as well as casting and editing. The programme was also named the overall outstanding comedy series.The programme features Waller-Bridge as a young woman living in London who provides the audience with outrageous and intimate details of her life. It premiered in 2016 to critical acclaim, but was initially overlooked at the Emmys, not scoring a single nomination.Waller-Bridge has also received acclaim as the writer and showrunner of the first season of the BBC America television series Killing Eve, starring Jodie Comer, who won an Emmy this week, and Sandra Oh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33437f4bea9094b37dac6bda8fe76575b140f7f9/0_144_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf29137d8d59f43409fd7b2d412027b","title":"pivot your favourite moments from friends","story":"The holiday armadillo, Danny DeVito as a policeman stripper, Brad Pitt’s I hate Rachel club ... here are readers’ best bits from FriendsThe aftermath of the Vegas wedding (and Ross not arranging the promised annulment) produced some of my favourite Chandler lines: “I couldn’t face the idea of another failed marriage” “Well. Can I ask at what stage you considered this to be a successful marriage?” and: “Ross, just for my own peace of mind, are you secretly married to any more of us?” mattyjjI love the one where Danny DeVito played the male stripper. Any time I hear the Soft Cell version of Tainted Love, I always picture DeVito in the policeman uniform. “Did someone call for the looong arm of the law?” DeVito seems like a good sport for taking the part. FrancoBegbieJnrThe one where the neighbour Mr Heckles dies and Chandler sees a foreshadowing of his own lonely future. The realisation comes when Chandler hears the noisy girls upstairs and whacks the ceiling with Heckles’ broom, then looks at it and throws it aghast to the floor like it’s on fire. I love that bit it’s classic Matthew Perry physical comedy. He was brilliant. And it had the melancholy that American comedy does so well. The last scene of Chandler alone in the empty room, turning the light off, was very human, which is why we loved it. And you did … even if you pretended you didn’t. colin_robinsonThe one where Brad Pitt comes to Thanksgiving and tells everyone he started the I hate Rachel Green club in high school. Chandler breaks Monica’s special dinner plates and the day’s been so disastrous she says: “Oh my God, I’ve lost the will to scold.” NorthernsoulgirlFor me, the single funniest moment of the entire thing is Chandler’s crazy roommate’s goldfish cracker. Also, Ross – he’s undoubtedly a weirdo and a bit of a creep, which is what makes him the best character in the show. Chandler has the best quips, but in terms of plot-based humour, Ross has the best episodes hands down. I mean, holiday armadillo! diibiiI remember laughing so much the first time I watched The Baby on the Bus episode. And I like the episode where Phoebe and Mike (Paul Rudd) are donating and un-donating money to charity – and when they change their names to Princess Consuela Banana Hammock and Crap Bag. ID027179Best single shot? The bit where it looks like Joey is mournfully looking through a rain splattered window and missing Chandler, then the camera pulls back and he is actually looking through a piece of ‘art’ he bought in some post Chandler-moving-out shopping spree. It was pretty much always great. This and Frasier on a Friday night were a great start to the weekend. Good days. arcaneenchanterThe One Where No One’s Ready is my favourite. All six characters come in and out of Monica’s apartment, driving three storylines of varying frivolity. It’s a lesson in how to write a simple and perfect sitcom episode that doesn’t go anywhere and doesn’t have to.One of my favourite lines.

They were YouTube and Instagram stars – or, more often, aspiring stars – here to “storm” Area 51 for the benefit of their followers and free the aliens held captive within. Or at least film themselves talking about it.Joining them was a ragged army of hundreds of stoners, UFO buffs, punk bands, rubberneckers, European tourists, people with way too much time on their hands, and meme-lords in Pepe the Frog costumes – all here because of the Internet, the ironic and the earnest alike, for a party at the end of the earth.Three months earlier, on 20 June 2019, the podcaster Joe Rogan released an interview with Bob Lazar. Lazar is a cult figure in UFO circles he claims to have studied flying saucers at Area 51, the classified air force base in Nevada where the US government is rumored – by some – to make secret contact with extraterrestrial beings.Rogan’s millions of listeners heard the interview.One of those listeners was Matty Roberts, a college student, anime enthusiast and video gamer in Bakersfield, California. Inspired by the Rogan podcast, Roberts created a joke Facebook event: “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us.” According to the plan, people would meet in Rachel, Nevada – the closest town to Area 51 – in the early morning of 20 September, then swarm the defenses and see for themselves if the government was hiding aliens.Things snowballed. Within hours, the page had thousands of RSVPs. Within days it had more than a million. The air force warned that things would end badly for anyone attempting a raid. The FBI paid the hapless Matty Roberts a house call.So he came up with a brilliant pivot: why not channel this momentum into a Burning Man-style music festival in the desert? He joined forces with Connie West, the operator of Rachel’s sole inn and restaurant, to plan what they called Alienstock.Then came the first schism. Scornful of the internet interlopers, the Alien Research Center in nearby Hiko, Nevada, decided to host its own Area 51 event the same weekend – for serious ufologists.Roberts and West pressed on. But the town of Rachel (population: 54) lacked the infrastructure to handle thousands of conspiracy theorists and gawkers descending on rural Nevada. The local authorities feared potential calamity: people dying of dehydration in the desert, angry landowners, madmen with guns.On 10 September, nine days before the event, Roberts backed out. He wanted no involvement in a “Fyre Fest 2.0”, he told the media. He accused West of being insufficiently prepared for the coming flood. Budweiser offered to sponsor a free, alternative Alienstock event in a “safe, clean” venue in downtown Las Vegas. Roberts urged people to go there instead.West refused to cancel the concert in the desert. She’d already sunk thousands of dollars of her own money into the event, she told reporters as she held back tears. Alienstock would happen, she said, whether anyone liked it or not.Now there were three rival events all happening on the same weekend – one in Las Vegas, another in Rachel and a third in Hiko. No one had any idea how many people were coming.I came equipped with a duffel bag of Hawaiian shirts and a case of vape cartridges, which I hoped to use as currency in the event of civilizational collapse in the desert.But the desert would wait. The “Area 51 Celebration” in downtown Las Vegas did not get off to a promising start. When I arrived, shortly after 7pm, the outdoor venue – heavily bedecked with glowing neon alien signage – was mostly empty except for cops and local newscasters. A DJ blasted dubstep to a bare dancefloor. The venue even had a swimming pool, bathed in green light and watched by a bored-looking lifeguard.I feared it might be a long night. I ordered a whiskey-and-water the bartender filled a plastic stadium cup to the brim.Then people started trickling in. Everyone was wearing their best alien-themed rave attire: one woman wore a shiny, and discomfitingly rubbery, head-to-toe alien costume. Another had a Rick-and-Morty-patterned dress. Three men tore up the dancefloor in matching alien-motif onesies. Someone carried a sign that said GREEN LIVES MATTER.I talked to two people who’d driven six hours from Tucson, Arizona, on a whim to attend. One was wearing a Flat Earth Society T-shirt, though he said it was ironic.I spied Matty Roberts in the center of a swirling mass of people, holding court. He was wearing a Slayer hat and black T-shirt his long, dark hair flowed majestically down his back. He looked like a heavy metal-listening, Mountain Dew-drinking samurai lord, surrounded by courtiers and supplicants. I fought my way over.He was in high spirits. “I’m absolutely amazed at how things turned out, and it’s incredible,” he told me as he signed autographs. I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question but he was swallowed up again by the crowd.By around 9pm, there were a couple hundred people jerking spasmodically to dubstep.A woman who introduced herself as Shereel (“C-H-E-R-Y-L”) said she was happy to be at the rave but disappointed she couldn’t make the event in the desert.“This is the first time since Roswell that people like us are all coming together,” she said. “Even if nothing happens, we tried.”The DJ interrupted his set to thank Matty Roberts and give a “special shout-out” to Bob Lazar. The crowd cheered.A warm wind was whipping through the arena. As the wind buffeted us and the rave lights flickered overhead, you could almost believe a UFO really was about to descend.The next morning I got in my rental car and headed north.The outskirts of Las Vegas – casinos, strip clubs, endless billboards for personal injury lawyers – dropped away rapidly. Now there was just desert in every direction, stunning in its vastness and austere beauty. Mountains towered over the highway, surrounded by hilly plains of cacti and scrub.Soon most human settlement was gone. There was nothing alongside the highway – no strip malls, no fast food joints, and, I noticed, worryingly few gas stations. I had at least two hours of driving ahead, though I knew I was going in the right direction: every vehicle I saw was a police car, an RV or a news satellite van.As I drove I listened to rightwing talk radio, then Top 40, then country, then a Bible discussion call-in show, then some Spanish-language stations, then static. A talk station interviewed the mother of a police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant. Sean Hannity made fun of the climate strike, and every talkshow discussed the New York Times’ recent, partly retracted accusation against Brett Kavanaugh. It was, they pointed out, yet another sign of bias in the liberal media.The first gas station was bustling with people buying water and jerry cans of gas. In the parking lot there was a camper van marked “AREA 51 – HERE WE COME”.Finally, two hours north of Las Vegas, I saw the exit for State Route 375 – also known, since its formal renaming in 1996, as Extraterrestrial Highway.The “Groom Lake airfield” – Area 51 – is part of a massive complex of military installations. Their activities are classified and the skies above are restricted air space. Little is known about what goes on there, though the air force tests experimental stealth aircraft, which may account for some UFO sightings.Of course, military pilots are themselves known to report seeing what they refer to as “unexplained aerial phenomena”. (Even the New York Times has reported on it.)In the 2000s, Congress established an “advanced aviation threat identification program” to study the problem. The program wasn’t classified, but it “operated with the knowledge of an extremely limited number of officials”, according to Politico. The then Nevada senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding.That’s the end of the history lesson. The reader is free to investigate further and come to their own conclusions.On the way to Rachel, I stopped at the rival festival at the Alien Research Center in Hiko. It was heavy on souvenir sellers, though there were some hardcore ufologists. A group called the Mutual UFO Network (Mufon) gave me a pamphlet offering certification to be a “field investigator”.If anything, the ufologists were more the exception than the rule. I had expected most Area 51 Stormers to be conspiracy theorists, 4chan types, or people on the fringe political spectrum, but a lot – probably most – were normies on a lark, or foreigners in search of peak Americana.Two young men – one Swiss German, the other Japanese – told me they were friends who’d met at an English as a second language program in New York. A group of Britons told me they’d been taking a road trip up the west coast, heard about the Area 51 business, and decided to take a detour.This was a common theme: “Well, I’d been thinking about taking a road trip anyway, sooo…”When my car turned the last switchback into the valley toward Area 51, the car radio, theretofore static, suddenly started blasting Smetana’s Má Vlast in eerie, crystal-perfect sound. The aliens, it seemed, were classical music buffs.Rachel came into view – a tiny, one-horse town besieged by cars and tents and camper vans. Including the cops, EMTs, festival organizers, and so on, there looked to be a couple thousand people – not the two million who had RSVP’d to the Facebook event, nor the 30,000 the sheriff feared, but more than I thought would follow through.Contrary to the wild warnings about a Fyre festival 2.0, things appeared mostly under control. Festival marshals waved me along to an assigned lot.My neighbors at the parking lot-slash-campsite were a punk band called Foreign Life Form. They weren’t part of the planned music lineup, one Life Form explained as he ate Chef Boyardee room-temperature from a can, but when they heard about Alienstock, it seemed like fate. They were trying to find the concert organizer to get added to the billing. To help seal the deal they’d painted their faces and arms green.My other neighbor, an erudite, joint-smoking history podcaster from Oregon, wore a T-shirt that said “Take me to your dealer”. He and his son had had the shirts custom-made the Life Forms were disappointed they couldn’t buy some.Getting to the actual entrance to Area 51 took another 20 minutes of driving on an unmarked, unpaved road. Clouds of chalk billowed behind the cars coming and going.At the end of the road was a drab military checkpoint flanked by concertina wire and threatening signs. The sign prohibiting photography was clearly a dead letter.Rotating shifts of law enforcement officers of every variety – sheriff’s deputies, state troopers, game wardens, park rangers – kept a watchful eye on everything. They seemed relaxed, though, and looked like they were having as good a time as the ostensible Stormers. After all, this was an excuse for them to hang out at Area 51, too.(To my knowledge, no one actually raided Area 51, besides the two Dutch YouTubers who had tried to sneak through the perimeter two weeks earlier and ended up in jail instead.)In addition to YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers, there were more than a few actual journalists. Watching them scurry around diligently with tape recorders reminded me that I needed to find a Quirky Character who could give On-Scene Color. A talkative UFO buff would be ideal but the other journalists had already claimed most of the good ones.I couldn’t avoid noticing a pair of men in huge, papier-mache Pepe the Frog heads. The vloggers loved them, and the Pepes enjoyed mugging for the cameras. “My God,” a girl said, “they’re adorable.”Under their frog heads, the Pepes were two young Latino guys from California. When I asked them what they thought of the frog’s association with the alt-right, one seemed confused. The other nodded in recognition but claimed he just thought the symbol was fun.He said, “It’s all about the –”“Memes,” finished the other. They both laughed.I asked if it wasn’t weird for them, as Latinos, to embrace a symbol affiliated with white nationalists.“Yeah, I mean, they’re a little, like, extreme for me sometimes,” one said. “But sometimes you feel like they’re right about some stuff.”“Like the idea that we’re all living in a world of clowns,” he clarified.Tendrils of fog hung over Alienstock. The temperature was dropping fast and the sun was low and pink in the sky. The sunset was sublime but I had a long drive to my motel ahead and a sick feeling that I should have left half an hour ago.I bid farewell to the history podcaster. He reminded me that the area was open grazing land. “Watch out for the steer,” he said. “They go right out into the road.”The next morning I debated whether to squeeze in another trip out to Alienstock and couldn’t quite find the willpower. It was time to get back to civilization, I decided. Or at least Las Vegas.I stopped at the gas station in Alamo, near Rachel. The town felt hungover, and it still had a day to go. Most of the locals seemed unsure quite how to feel about the whole thing. It was a boon to the local economy, yes, but also a financial disaster for the county government. There were rumors that the district attorney was planning to sue Connie West, or Matty Roberts, or even Facebook.Most, though, just seemed excited at the idea that their corner of the world might become something bigger than a gas stop on the way elsewhere.Everyone vowed that next year, they’d be ready."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e135ee2f3678b50060b607f24e36e9baa4227a48/457_196_1106_664/master/1106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3041b5ee6c98096583f24248d5bfa2a5","title":"simple tips for blitzing your work to do list","story":"You don’t need to master mindfulness or download a complicated productivity app to stay on top of your adminEver get to that stage where you seem to be spending all your time and energy just putting things off? You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c96f59f9112f31113a6547eaebf07b18ebd390e/0_252_2604_1563/master/2604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b47ec893d6d57dd40bcefd59d9c74b7","title":"erdogan proposes plan for refugee safe zone in syria","story":"Turkish president tells UN expanded zone could resettle millions of refugees in TurkeyAn expanded “safe zone” in northern Syria could include as many as 3 million people and stretch for 50 miles as far as Raqqa, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan proposed at the UN general assembly as he pressed his case to speed up the resettlement of Syrian refugees living in Turkey.His idea, viewed as controversial with Kurds in northern Syria and seen by them as a Turkish landgrab, was his main proposal in a speech projecting Erdoğan’s as a spokesman for Muslims across the world.He told the UN: “If this safe zone can be declared we can resettle confidently somewhere between 1 to 2 million refugees. Whether with the US or the coalition forces, Russia and Iran, we can walk shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand so refugees can resettle, saving them from tent camps and container camps.”He said he was hoping to establish a corridor with an initial depth of 30km and a length of 480km, enabling the settlement of up to 2 million Syrians, adding that “if we can extend the depth of this safe zone to a Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor line, we can increase the number of Syrians who will return from Turkey, Europe and other parts of the world.”He said such an expanded zone could contain as many as 3 million people, claiming that as many as 500,000 Syrians had been born in Turkey in the last seven years.Erdoğan said the plan required an international UN-led donor conference with countries currently housing Syrian refugees, especially Jordan and Lebanon, providing financial help for those returning to safe areas.Kurds in northern Syria fear Turks and their proxy forces will repeat the violent displacement that saw many dislodged from the formerly Kurdish-controlled town of Afrin last year.Syrian Kurds have conceded joint US and Turkish ground and aerial patrols between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, but reject plans for it to be extended any wider.American support to the Syrian Kurds has been a point of tension between Ankara and Washington since the US military began arming the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) in 2014.The military arm of the SDF is led by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia which Ankara views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ party ( PKK). Turkey and the US have designated the PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey, a terrorist group.Turkey has joined US-led operations in Syria with two Turkish F-16 warplanes flew over YPG-held Syria.The Kurds also fear many of the Syrians that might be placed in the safe zone are not native to north-east Syria, and might displace the Kurdish culture and rights.In the run-up to the general assembly, Erdoğan has been increasingly impatient about the speed with which the US is allowing the safe zone to be established, and pressed Donald Trump to speed up the process. Erdoğanin his speech repeated none of his threats about pushing into Syria unilaterally if his plan is rebuffed by the US.The Kurds are unhappy after being excluded from a Syrian constitutional committee set up by Russia, with the agreement of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad and designated with preparing a new constitution for the country.Assad and Russia have stalled on the committee’s composition for over a year in a bid to strengthen their military position on the ground, and so reduce the claims of the Syrian opposition to seats on the committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7408cd8fbfe857f0d1d6e55ed27db82ae3d8bfc2/0_35_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a1b8419e43ff292de983096c837dd41","title":"pope francis criticises overuse of adjectives","story":"Pope gives views on language in speech to Vatican communications teamPope Francis has taken aim at adjectives while giving his views on language to the Vatican communications team, saying: “I am allergic to those words.”In a speech to the team on Monday, the pope took particular aim at the word “authentic”, especially when describing “authentic Christians”.“We have fallen into the culture of adjectives and adverbs, and we have forgotten the strength of nouns … Why say authentically Christian? It is Christian! The mere fact of the noun ‘Christian’, ‘I am Christ’ is strong: it is an adjective noun, yes, but it is a noun.“The communicator must make people understand the weight of the reality of nouns that reflect the reality of people. And this is a mission of communication: to communicate with reality, without sweetening with adjectives or adverbs.”The Vatican Dicastery for Communication, led by prefect Paolo Ruffini, underwent a revamp this year, with Matteo Bruni, a British-Italian, appointed as director of the press office in June. Bruni’s appointment came after the abrupt departure of American Greg Burke in late December.Francis began his speech to the communications team by saying: “I have a speech to read, it’s not than long, it’s seven pages … but I’m sure that after the first one the majority of you will fall asleep.”He later added: “For the Church, communication is a mission. No investment is too great for spreading the Word of God. At the same time, every talent must be well spent, made to bear fruit.”Francis thanked the team, which is also responsible for maintaining his hugely popular Twitter account, for their work.“But what should communication be like?” he said. “One of the things you must not do is advertising, mere advertising. You must not behave like human business that try to attract more people … To use a technical word: you must not proselytise. It is not Christian to proselytise.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029102.1569343640!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin needs more hotels says f%C3%A1ilte ireland after vote to curb","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCouncillors on Monday night voted to initiate a change to the city development plan to limit hotels. Photograph: iStockDublin is facing a shortfall of more than 1,000 hotel rooms Fáilte Ireland has said, despite calls by Dublin city councillors for a curb on hotel construction in the city.Councillors on Monday night voted to initiate a change to the city development plan to limit hotels, and review the plan to propose other changes which could be made to “urgently protect and promote nightlife and creative culture in Dublin”.Councillors also agreed that any council land which was not suitable for social housing would be assessed for its potential for cultural use as an alternative to sale.While councillors of all parties spoke in favour of the motion, city planner John O’Hara said limiting hotels under the city development plan would leave the council open to legal action. “Any talk of a ban or curtailment without evidence runs the risk of legal challenge,” he said.Head of Planning Richard Shakespeare said it was a management function to initiate a change to the development plan and the council’s management did not intend to do so. The council passed the motion regardless.“After almost a decade of inactivity, a strong pipeline of new hotel accommodation stock is expected to improve tourism capacity pressures in Dublin by 2020. However, this activity is still being outpaced by growing demand and an expected shortfall of at least 1,100 rooms.”This lack of supply in the capital affected the rest of the country, she said.“Dublin is where most visitors choose to spend part of their stay in the city. Over 85 per cent of visitors access Ireland through Dublin. Therefore, if visitors cannot access Dublin, it is highly likely they may not visit the country at all.”Green Party councillor Patrick Costello said the proposal to limit hotels was an attempt to “restore balance” to the city development plan.“If all we are building in the city is hotels and aparthotels that is not serving the city or valuing creativity in the city. That is the reason people come here, they don’t come for hotels.”The perceived shortage of hotels in the city, could be because they are being inappropriately used, he said.“If the occupancy rates are so high, it has to be asked how many of these rooms are being booked by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive? How many are booked out by people working in Dublin who are finding it cheaper to stay in a hotel than to rent? We need to question what outside factors are distorting these figures.”Labour councillor Rebecca Moynihan points to several hotels in the Dublin 8 area which have replaced cultural uses such as a 242-room aparthotel replacing the Tivoli Theatre on Francis Street and the 202-room Aloft hotel replacing artists studios on Mill Street.The city had a greater need for housing than hotels she said.Monday’s council meeting was called following the planned closure of the Bernard Shaw pub and venue in Portobello, and the decision by councillors to sell council owned land near the venue to a developer.Last week it emerged that the Bernard Shaw will reopen on the northside of the city in the Porterhouse Whitworth pub close to Cross Guns Bridge on the border between Glasnevin and Phibsborough.The meeting came just days after another large scale hotel was granted permission in the city, which will involve large scale demolition.Keily family company Greybirch has secured permission for an eight-storey 116-bedroom hotel on at block at George’s Quay opposite Liberty Hall and beside Mulligan’s pub on Poolbeg Street. Buildings on the quays, Poolbeg Street and on Tara Street will be demolished to make way for the development, including the Tara Building, which opened in recent years as a co-working premises with its exterior painted by street artist Maser."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"No fresh water and rat droppings on floor are among the complaints voiced about facilitiesTaoiseach also asserts \u0026lsquowide gap\u0026rsquo remains between EU and UK on achieving goals\u0026lsquoArrogant\u0026rsquo man also sent nasty letter threatening legal action against restaurant a day after altercationNational Lottery confirms arrangements are being made for collection of prizeSecretary general welcomes 77 countries\u0026rsquo commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050Work by 13th-century Italian master Cimabue is discovered in property north of ParisFirm believes social media data would assist investigation into campaign against executivesAppeal made to driver of silver Ford Focus which had to slow when a black Audi pulled out in front of it to come forwardTaoiseach among 50 world leaders to borrow US president\u0026rsquos favourite phrase, says New York TimesDeclan Walsh says assumption US government would assist reporters \u0026lsquono longer holds firm\u0026rsquoWorkplace Relations Commission orders Co Clare school to pay \u0026euro3,500 compensation in discrimination caseWhat does the British supreme court\u0026rsquos ruling mean for Boris Johnson and for Brexit?Sex offenders least likely to offend again but robbers and burglars most likely, data showsGarda and staff member of Dublin Fire Brigade who also took part in video suspendedCriticism by defence forces personnel of Paul Kehoe has increased markedly in recent monthsReports suggest increase in deaths among young females, Oireachtas committee hearsDrivers will be obliged to accept card payments, says National Transport AuthorityFrankfurt court decision comes over claims made by company that sells \u0026lsquoanti-hangover\u0026rsquo supplements"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029046.1569346962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new york times journalist helped by irish diplomats to flee egypt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe incident was revealed on Tuesday in an opinion piece by New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger addressing a “growing threat” to journalism around the world. Photograph:iStock The Irish-born New York Times correspondent who had to rely on diplomats from Ireland to help him flee Egypt, says it taught him journalists could not always assume the US government would support them. Declan Walsh (46) left Cairo in August, 2017 after a tip-off from an American official that he faced possible detention by authorities following the publication of a sensitive article. However, it simultaneously emerged the Trump administration was aware of the threat but appeared content to let the arrest take place instead of warning him. Mr Walsh told The  there has been an “underlying assumption for many years” that when reporters from major American media institutions get into difficulties abroad “that they can rely on the US government to step in and help and apply pressure to stop bad things from happening”. However, his 2017 experience showed him “these assumptions no longer hold firm”. The incident was revealed on Tuesday in an opinion piece by New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger addressing a “growing threat” to journalism around the world. In it, he said the US official who tipped them off had done so without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. “Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out,” Mr Sulzberger wrote. “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats travelled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him.”Mr Walsh, who is originally from Ballina, Co Mayo, has been the newspaper’s Cairo bureau chief since 2015. He has worked for the New York Times since 2012 and was previously expelled from Pakistan for his work there. It is unclear what specifically angered the Egyptian authorities about his work, although his article examining the death of Italian Giulio Regeni, who was found in 2016 with indications he had been tortured, held claims from sources implicating Egyptian security services. Their response to the article was almost instant. “It was very fast. I think (the article) went online in the morning and this happened in the mid or later afternoon,” Mr Walsh said of the warning he then received. “We came to the view that I should leave Egypt as soon as possible.”Having flown to Germany, he later spent a couple of weeks in London before deciding to return to Cairo. As with all of its foreign staff, the New York Times applies careful security planning in such circumstances. “(I) returned to Egypt and everything was fine in the sense that I returned and I had no problem at the airport and I went back to work,” he recalled. “I was a little apprehensive you are worried that whatever the problem was hadn’t gone away.”The opinion piece also mentions Taoiseach in a section about the “alarming” global spread of “the term ‘fake news’ to justify varying levels of anti-press activity”, a phrase frequently employed by US president Donald Trump.“It has been used by liberal leaders, like Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar. It’s been used by right-wing leaders, like Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro,” the article says. One of the first times the terms was used by the Taoiseach was in a Dáil debate in April 2018, when asked about a reported row in Cabinet over judicial appointments Mr Varadkar said: “There has been a lot of fake news on the front pages this week”. Asked in New York about the piece, Mr Varadkar said he hadn’t seen the article but said: “Any time that I’ve referred to fake news - and it wouldn’t be regular - what I mean is news that isn’t true. Unfortunately, it is the case that from time to time, news is reported as news and it turns out not to be true or not to be the full truth. Perhaps it’s not a good term to use, because of its association with President Trump who has a different agenda.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

The future belongs to patriots.It is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting programme of national renewal.Donald Trump addressing the UN on TuesdayMr Trump urged the world to unite against Iran\u0027s blood lust”, noting: “It is time for Iran’s leaders to finally put the Iranian people first.”He said that the US has “no permanent enemies,” but he warned that Tehran needed to abandon its current policies to be rewarded.“As long as Iran’s menacing behaviour continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened,” he said. Mr Trump\u0027s third address to the global gathering had been hotly anticipated - his first year, in 2017, saw him stun the delegates with a broadside against multilateralism, while last year he was laughed at to his face when he claimed to have accomplished more than any other US president before him.This year his speech was more predictable.Mr Trump addressed migration, urging migrants not to cross over into the US illegally, and called for nations to respect religious freedom – emphasising the right of countries to restrict abortion access on religious grounds.He said he was looking forward to working with Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, on a “magnificent” trade deal after Brexit. The two men met later on Tuesday.Mr Trump called on China to respect the Hong Kong protesters, and once again defended his trade war.  He accused China of currency manipulation and dumping, and called for reform of the World Trade Organisation. He said China should not be able to “game the system at others’ expense” through the WTO. “As far as America is concerned, those days are over,” he said. He urged North Korea to denuclearise, and hit out against Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan leader – while the Venezuelan delegate pointedly read a book about national hero Simon Bolivar. In a striking admission he did not mention Juan Guaido, the US-backed interim president, by name.Also notable was his failure to mention the Israel-Palestine agreement he has been promising for the past three years, and his skipping of references to Syria or Yemen. Donald Trump, ahead of his trip to New York for the UNHis speech was preceded by Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u0027s president, who took office in January and made his UN debut.Mr Bolsonaro, as expected, spoke on the themes of sovereignty and independence - and hit back at his critics for describing the Amazon fires as a global problem.He lashed out at those who seek to intervene in the Amazon fires, accusing them of having a colonialist attitude and patronising the indigenous people - many of whom, he argued, want to be able to exploit their lands.The Amazon is not being devastated, nor is it being consumed by fire, as the media misleadingly says, he said.Also speaking on Tuesday were Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Canada\u0027s Justin Trudeau, Turkey\u0027s leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and British prime minister Boris Johnson.  His wide-ranging and soberly-delivered speech lasted around 40 minutes, and addresses the following:Calls for China to respect Hong Kong\u0027s democracyIran\u0027s \u0027blood lust\u0027 and calls to unite against itMigration and a repudiation of open borders activismVenezuela, and US readiness to help with humanitarian aidReligious freedom and the right to prevent late-term abortionSlightly strange to bring this domestic issue to the UN.But Trump is now moving on to defend the Second Amendment.Our Founding Fathers chose to entrust American power to those most invested: the people.He says American citizens are nourished by its culture, committed to its values.Liberty is only preserved... by the will and devotion of patriots.Trump refers to Nicolas Maduro as a brutal dictator.Interesting that he does not mention Juan Guaido, who he has previously backed whole-heartedly.Nicolas Maduro, president of VenezuelaWe await the day... when liberty will prevail across the continent.One of the biggest challenges we face is the spectre of socialism.Socialism and communism are not about justice, lifting up the poor, or the good of the nation. They are only about the power of the ruling class.Throughout the hemisphere there are millions of young people eager to build and create.But these nations can not build their potential if these people leave.We want every nation in our region to thrive.For that reason we support those living under brutal repression, including those in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.Says all nations must condemn Iran\u0027s actionsWarns sanctions will be tightened unless Iran changes courseProtests in Hong KongBoris Johnson and Donald Trump, pictured in France at the G7 in AugustHe talks about his investment in the military, and how his main priority is to keep Americans safe.If you want peace, love your nation. Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.It is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting programme of national renewal.It\u0027s his third address to the UN.He began speaking at 10:10am local time.Brazil\u0027s president argues that they should be allowed to exploit their own land, for their own people.He says that France and Germany grow food on half of their land, where as much of Brazil\u0027s is protected.We reject the attempts to export and use the indigenous policy agenda as tools... disguised as good intentions.First of all may I say that my administration has committed itself to environmental protection and sustainable development.We are one of the countries that most protects the environment.The sensational attacks we have suffered... have aroused our patriotic sentiment.Certain countries instead of helping embarked in a disrespectful manner and invoked a colonial attitude.He called - without naming Macron - the G7 proposal absurd.Jair Bolsonaro and Emmanuel Macron began an extraordinary spat in August when Mr Macron called the Amazon fires a global problemHe says that often times some of the indigenous leaders have been used as tools in an information war.And he makes his case for allowing logging on protected indigenous lands.Some people inside and outside of Brazil have stubbornly insisted on treated our indigenous people like cavemen.They do not want to be poor landholders sitting on rich lands.Especially sitting on rich lands. These reserves are home to vast reserves of gold, diamonds and other minerals.He said people still view Brazil as a country without rules, and without sovereignty.And he said many indigenous people want the economic exploitation of their lands, rather than keeping them as a protected area.Fires in the Amazon this summerJair Bolsonaro takes the floor.It\u0027s his first time at the United Nations - he was elected in January.Jair Bolsonaro, president of BrazilYou can read more here about the far-Right former army officer, who has not shied away from controversy in his first year in office.Mr Trump\u0027s speechwriting team, headed up by hardliner Stephen Miller, will have been crafting his remarks for weeks.In his first year at the UN, 2017, he left the delegates stunned with his aggressive denouncement of multilateralism.Last year he was laughed at to his face when he opened his remarks by claiming he had achieved more than any other US president before.Donald Trump is making his third speech at the UNThis year his advisers will be hoping it\u0027s third time lucky.Asked yesterday what he planned to say, he replied:I\u0027m going to bring up a lot. We have a lot of different things to talk about. If I talk about everything... it would go on for two days. There are a lot things to talk about.We have a lot of really great relationships and we have some relationships that are let\u0027s call it \u0027in formation\u0027. But we\u0027ll be talking about Iran, we\u0027ll be talking about various things that we are doing. We are also going to be talking about the economy.The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, is speaking now, ahead of Jair Bolsonaro - the first world leader due to speak.Mr Guterres, a 70-year-old former prime minister of Portugal, has made climate change the focus of this year\u0027s gathering. Something which sits uncomfortably with the first two speakers - Mr Bolsonaro and Donald Trump.Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-generalThe annual gathering at the United Nations famously sets the stage for diplomatic fireworks.This year promises to be no different, with Donald Trump\u0027s meeting with the Ukrainian president among the most hotly-watched bilateral, and Emmanuel Macron\u0027s feud with Jair Bolsonaro likely to play out in public.Also watch what Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u0027s leader,  says and does. He is due to meet Boris Johnson later today.And, of course, Mr Johnson\u0027s speech is going to be interesting...Here\u0027s a rundown of some expected highlights.Donald Trump meets Boris Johnson, the then foreign secretary, at the United Nations general assembly in 2017Money-spinning Conservative Conference to go ahead despite MPs being summoned to ParliamentDoctor on bike killed by driver who could not see her over the clutter on his dashboard, court hearsBoris\u0026#39s hardball strategy with EU appears to be spent - with both sides readying for bigger battle aheadRoyal Military Police arrest man in connection with 1981 disappearance of toddler Katrice LeeGeoffrey Cox in the political cross-hairs after his prorogation legal advice leakedBoris Johnson hits back at Supreme Court ruling saying people want to \u0026#39frustrate Brexit\u0026#39 and \u0026#39stop this country coming out of the EU\u0026#39US government planned to \u0026#39sit on information\u0026#39 of a journalist\u0026#39s arrest in Egypt, New York Times claimsWorld has \u0026#39legal obligation\u0026#39 to confront forced organ harvesting in China, UN toldFranco\u0026#39s remains to be exhumed after Supreme Court rulingSNP\u0026#39s justice policies attacked as violence and sex crimes surge in ScotlandWho is Gina Miller, the businesswoman who took on Boris Johnson and won?What happens next for Brexit and Boris Johnson after the Supreme Court ruling on prorogation?Royal Tour 2019: A guide to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s South Africa itineraryNicola Sturgeon: Supreme Court ruling shows Scotland should separate from \u0026#39lawbreaking\u0026#39 UKBoris Johnson should apologise to Parliament for prorogation, says Sir John MajorComment: We’ve seen some mad days in British politics.

The announcement comes amid widespread rumours that manufacture would be moved to China.Apple specifically credited the work of the Trump administration in helping it have some components excluded, which is thought to be part of the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China. The US manufacturing of Mac Pro is made possible following a federal product exclusion Apple is receiving for certain necessary components, it wrote in its announcement.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.The transport body\u0026nbsppreviously removed Uber’s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.The decision prompted legal action, which led to a judge granting the Silicon Valley company a probationary 15-month licence in 2018 after it made several changes to its business model in London.London is one of the most important markets for the firm in Europe.A TfL spokesman said: “Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern \u0026amp Eastern Europe, said the decision demonstrated TfL’s recognition of the company’s “improved culture and governance”.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information,” he said.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution.”Uber launches helicopter service between Manhattan and JFK airportHowever, unions claimed that TfL was still failing to properly regulate Uber.James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the\u0026nbspIndependent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB)\u0026nbspsaid: “Once again, TfL’s failure to regulate effectively and Uber’s unwillingness to play by the rules has led to the jobs of 40,000 Uber drivers being thrown into uncertainty. Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.”The London Taxi Drivers’ Association described Uber as a “threat to public safety”.LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: “Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the Mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the Mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He told Inside Out on BBC West: “Most people haven’t lived anywhere on their own and halls can be quite a nice transition period but we don’t have that.“We’ve just been thrown out into the wind.”Grace Whittaker, another student who had no accommodation, was told that there was\u0026nbsphousing in Langford, in North Somerset, and in\u0026nbspNewport – which is more than 30 miles away and in a different country.She said: “If you know how big the courses are, you know how many spaces you have for students and you know how many halls you have for students – so why give out so many offers and why let people through clearing if we are not going to have accommodation?”A record number of students across the country took up places on degrees through clearing this year.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population and yet student numbers at institutions\u0026nbspremain uncapped.\u0026nbspUniversities across the UK\u0026nbsphave been expanding in recent years – and the number of students at Bristol has risen by 15 per cent in three years, from 21,555 in 2014-15 to 24,850 in 2017-18.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Especially in first year it felt as if everyone was pushing into each other to sit there,” he said. “They are trying to stretch each course as much as possible.”Mr Braakman added that he thought the university was accepting too many people – similar to airlines overbooking flights.He said: “If I knew about the housing situation in Bristol, if it was transparent that there was not much accommodation in general, then I wouldn’t choose Bristol.”Mr Bemrose told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“There are still a number of postgraduate and Erasmus students who are struggling to find accommodation in the private market.”“I still think there is work that needs to be done to ensure all students are getting the help they need,” he added. “We need to prevent a similar situation happening in the future.”Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “The fact that flying to and from university is a cheaper and simpler option than renting is a damning example of the housing crisis students are facing.“Universities are simply not doing enough to ensure all their students have access to affordable, safe and decent accommodation from the start.”Sarah Purdy, who is responsible for student wellbeing at the University of Bristol, said she was “really sorry” to hear students were anxious about a lack of accommodation.But she said the process was similar each year and it will be “same in every university” in the UK.Ms Purdy added: “I think this year there were larger numbers of students involved in the process in part because we had fewer students who decided to defer or withdraw from the guaranteed offer.”But she insisted that the university had not “let students in, over and above the numbers” it had planned to admit.A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Colleagues in our accommodation team have been working incredibly hard over the past few weeks to inidually support those students who were not part of the 6,000 students we have already placed in university-owned or university-managed accommodation.“As each day has passed we have managed to bring down the number still looking for suitable accommodation and before our students started to arrive this weekend we were able to offer every student accommodation in Bristol or at our Langford campus.”They added: “We believe our website and the information we supply to students gaining a place at Bristol is clear about the accommodation we can offer and the processes we follow. We are sorry if Sohail or any other student feels it is not clear.“We always look to see where our processes can be improved and\u0026nbsp we will review our communications as part of this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”Mr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: “You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.“The wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.”Following Facebook\u0027s announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is thrilled  to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.Recent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people\u0027s personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us, wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.CTRL-Labs’ wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person’s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.A paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in\u0026nbspNature Communications\u0026nbspearlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.“We’re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,” Facebook said at the time.\u0026nbsp“One in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us – as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.The case stems from the EU court’s 2014 ruling that people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. That decision forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.One year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just those appearing on European country sites like google.fr.Now, the EU court said that such application to territories outside the EU was not legal. It said it was “not apparent” from the EU legal text “that it would have intended to impose on an operator, such as Google, a de-referencing obligation which also concerns the national versions of its search engine that do not correspond to the member states.”Those who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the website to ones outside the EU – by switching from google.fr to google for example – to find the information that must be removed within the EU.Since 2014, Google has received more than 845,000 requests to remove more than 3 million web addresses from its results. Around 45 per cent of “right to be forgotten” requests have been successful.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually, Apple releases the new version of iOS for its tablet and phone at the same time, but that was also delayed.This year is the first time Apple officially split the two different platforms apart, creating iPadOS as distinct from iOS for iPhone. That presumably helped Apple delay, since the two are now separate products.New iPhone update will include bugs and have missing featuresIt initially said iOS 13.1 and iPadOS would arrive on 30 September. It appears it has been finished earlier than expected, and will arrive later today – most likely around 6pm UK time or 10am local pacific time.It will be available to download as normal, by heading to the Settings app, clicking general and choosing the software update version. iPhones can also update themselves automatically, meaning that it will prompt a user to update overnight if they do not do so manually.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By simulating all the variables, town planners would be able to figure out ways to eliminate traffic congestion and pollution issues – or at least understand them better.But if they could simulate entire cities, then why not entire universes? This was the question posed by MIT professor Seth Lloyd, who suggested that the world we exist in is in fact a giant quantum computer.\u0026nbspBeyond theories that we are actually living inside\u0026nbspThe Matrix, this ability to perform complex simulations could eventually see quantum computers simulate the beginnings of the universe and maybe one day answer some of science’s most puzzling questions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Umar’s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.Tribal leaders, politicians and officials in Helmand, however, disputed this account and accused the US and Afghan forces of killing around 40 civilians, most of them returning from a wedding party on Sunday night, many of them women and children.Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president, has been among public figures who has condemned the deaths and called for an investigation into what happened.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

I want to teach all the girls, so they have access to education.”Andrew QuiltySave the ChildrenBut the national security staff of his successor, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan defence ministry and US military officials refuted the charges. They say that Umar had been tracked to the compound in the town of Musa Qala after extensive surveillance and was about to carry out terrorist acts when the military mission was authorised.AQIS, which was set up by Zawahiri in 2014, is known to have operated in Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as Afghanistan. It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.Four years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan. The town of Musa Qala, where the raid took place, had particular resonance, having changed hands several times under a British strategy of engagement with the Talibs,\u0026nbspone which the Americans were highly critical.airstrike in Lashkar Gah\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)US and Afghan forces faced fierce resistance, according to American officials, from a combined group of determined al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters when they surrounded a compound in Musa Qala late on Sunday night, with a firefight lasting more than six hours.US warplanes were then called in to break the stalemate and carried out what American officials described as “precision strikes”, followed by the troops moving in.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.”US officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.Mohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people’s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result “three women are among the dead, and three children are wounded”, he stated.Karim Atal, a member of Helmand’s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. “Some say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,” he said.Abdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The tribunal found evidence they were “being used as a bank of organs” and subjected to regular medical testing.China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015. In a statement earlier this year, it accused the London-based China Tribunal of perpetuating “rumours”.But Sir Geoffrey, also speaking on Tuesday at a separate NGO-hosted UN event, said the evidence collated by the tribunal meant the international community “can no longer avoid what it is inconvenient for them to admit”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sir Geoffrey called on the International Transplant Society and national medical associations dealing with transplant surgery to “face up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act”.\u0026nbspSome countries, including Italy, Spain, Israel and Taiwan, already have restrictions in place for those seeking to travel to China for organ transplant surgery.And the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac), which initiated the China Tribunal, said it expects a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in the UK parliament in October.Etac is hoping its findings will prompt the Human Rights Council to open up a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China, said Susie Hughes, the organisation’s executive director.In his speech, Mr Sabi said\u0026nbspthat the targeting of minority groups for organ harvesting amounted to a “possible charge of genocide”, and compared it to other examples of mass religious or racial persecution in recent history.“Victim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people,” he told the Human Rights Council. “It is the legal obligation of UN Member States to address this criminal conduct.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Compared to this, the Himalayas, for example, represent a rather simple system. There you can follow several large fault lines across a distance of more than 2000 km.’Much of the rest of the remaining mass sank below the waters to the west of the country, covered by coral reefs, shallow seas and sediments. Those sediments went on to form rocks, which in turn were scraped off as the continent sank beneath tectonic plates leaving mountain ranges in the Alps, Apennines, Balkans, Greece and Turkey.The vast stretch of land covered by the continent\u0026nbspmeant the region\u0027s history required further unpicking by scientists, who combatted with each nation’s understanding of the geological backstory as they mapped its evolution from the Triassic period.Mr van Hinsbergen said: “This is not only a large region, but it also hosts more than 30 countries. Each of these has its own geological survey, own maps, and own ideas about the evolutionary history.“Research often stops at the national borders. Therefore, the region is not just fragmented from a geological perspective.”It is not the first time lost land masses have been discovered.

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is not clear who runs it, but it also operates two websites: globalclimatestrike.net and peoplesdemands.org.On the latter, it publishes what passes as its manesto. Read it, and it becomes very clear what lies behind the climate strikes.It is really the anti-capitalist movement — the lot who used to demand an end to globalisation — in green disguise.Astonishingly, it opposes not just nuclear energy but also “mega hydro” , biofuels and carbon capture and storage.These are all technologies central to the Government’s ambition to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by .Yet FridaysfortheFuture wants the world to move to zero carbon energy by  —  years earlier.How on Earth does it expect to achieve that  It wants humanity toto living in pre-industrial conditions.And it wants to “support non-market approaches to climate action”.In other words, it wants some kind of primitive socialist society.The trouble is thatwe went back to living in pre-industrial conditions we would very rapidly end up with pre-industrial levels of hunger, disease and child mortality.There is another way to tackle climate change, which is to invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon tech through a liberal, market economy to build a proper energy infrastructure.Children are right to be concerned about the planet, but they might care to take a closer look at the  ideology behind their climate strikes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition. To give credit to the EU negotiators, they have played hardball all along and used every trick to avoid concessions.Imagine how they would negotiatethey knew that our Government would be committed to telling the public to reject that deal afterwards!Unfortunately, this policy may become a reality. All too many activist delegates to Labour Conference are out of touch with the history and the values of the party, and do not respect traditional voters’ opposition to EU federalism and neoliberalism.This is leading to anger and disillusionment in leave voting areas, which a majority of Labour MPs represent. Many decent, patriotic Labour voters feel alienated by the suggestion they were at best foolish to vote to Leave and should know better next time.Labour should take warning. Labour voters in seats we must win to take seize power may never dream of voting Conservative. BUT they now have a credible option.The Brexit Party has a clear promise to follow through on the referendum vote. It includes left-wing MEPs and cannot be dismissed as simply UKIP mark II.If Labour does not recognise this danger and recommit to our existing policy of honouring Brexit, its future may be bleak.

Being too heavy raises a person’s risk of type  diabetes, liver and heart disease, and several common cancers.A new report from the British Psychological Society calls for an end to fat shaming.And said ministers must tackle the obesity crisis in the same fashion as smoking.Researchers argue people pile on the pounds as a result of a complex combination of factors, including genetics, stressful childhood experiences, busy lestyles and easy availability of junk food.Chartered psychologist Dr Angel Chater from the University of Bedfordshire, one of report authors, said obesity levels have rocketed by nearly a fth between  and .She said: “This cannot be explained by a sudden loss of motivation across the four nations of the UK.“The increase in obesity can in part be attributed to changes in the food supply and physical activity environment.“So the people most likely to be an unhealthy weight are those who have a high genetic risk of developing obesity and lives shaped by work, school and social environments that promote overeating and inactivity.”Experts added up to half of adults attending specialist obesity services have experienced childhood adversity.The report warns dieters are also particularly susceptible to emotional eating.The British Psychological Society does not support following the example of the World Health Organisation and classing obesity as a disease.But said it remains important to avoid language and explanations that locate the problem of obesity within iniduals.Sarb Bajwa, chief executive of the BPS, said: The Government acknowledged that obesity was a threat to the health of the nation back in , but the problem has continued to get worse.We need a similar effort on obesity to the one we have seen on smoking.It has taken action at all levels for decades, from government policy to helping inidual smokers, but we are now seeing signicant reductions in the level of smoking and the health problems it causes.Psychologists have the science and clinical experience to help the health service do the same for obesity.” Matt Lambert, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said: “People do not become overweight or obese overnight.Instead we are faced day-in and day-out with unhealthy environments that make junk food convenient, cheap and all too readily available.“Once we stop blaming iniduals maybe we can start taking action so that future generations are not crippled by this epidemic.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Andrew would certainly be an obvious person to assist with this enquiry. He is clearly deeply involved in this case.Epstein was arrested on July  by FBI agents after he landed at Teterboro airport in New Jersey following a flight from Paris Le Bourget airport in his private jet.US prosecutors had alleged that Epstein  ‘sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls’ from  to  at his properties in New York and Florida.Epstein – who faced  years in prison – had entered a not guilty plea when he appeared before judges on July .Key witness Virginia Roberts said had also frequently been sent to France to serve as his sex slave when she was still a minor.Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said that Epstein’s victims also included two -year-old girls who had been sent to him from France by one of his friends as a surprise birthday present.Beyond Ms Maxwell, those alleged to have taken part in this sex trafficking included the French fashion scout Jean-Luc Brunel.Both Maxwell and Brunel have firmly denied any wrongdoing.Roberts claims she was first recruited by Maxwell, who has joint British and French nationality, to work as a masseuse to Epstein when she was aged .Following a criminal conviction in the USA in , Epstein was placed on a sex offenders register and served  months of a prison sentence.Epstein spent three weeks at his Paris apartment before his arrest, and had frequently stayed there before this time too.Referring to the time Epstein had boasted about abusing two -year-old girls, Roberts said: It was a surprise birthday gt from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were -year-olds and flown over from France because theyre really poor over there, and their parents needed the money, or whatever the case is, and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out.The girls, who may have been from Eastern European, would now be aged around .Ghislaine Maxwell has called Roberts a liar, prompting her to launch a defamation suit against Maxwell in .In legal depositions connection to this libel case, Roberts said:  I also had sexual intercourse with Jean-Luc Brunel many times when I was  through  years old.He was another of Epstein’s powerful friends who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world.In fact, his only similarity with Epstein and the only link to their friendship appeared to be that Brunel could get dozens of underage girls and feed Epstein’sstrong appetite for sex with minors.The libel case Roberts brought against Maxwell was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in , and so never went to trial.Roberts allegations about Prince Andrew were struck from the US court record for being immaterial and impertinent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save.

Make all NHS prescriptions free in England  Prescription charges will be abolished in England under a Labour government. The dramatic change would bring England in line with the rest of the UK and save money for millions of patients. Prescriptions are currently free for patients living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but cost £ per item for those in England who do not qualy for an exemption. The party said the fees can be a burden for people with long-term conditions such as asthma and chronic kidney disease who can spend up to £ a year on medication - and pointed to research which suggested the charges put people off collecting prescribed medicine. Brits would work just  hours a week with no loss of pay within a decade under a radical new policy announced by the Labour Party.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell today vowed to drastically cut average full-time hourshe gets into  Downing Street.The proposal - which would cut average weekly hours from the current . - goes even further than a sensible target that was put forward this month in a review for Labour.John McDonnellaposs pledge stops short of making  hours a week compulsory - instead is says only average hours would be cut. And it does not explicitly mention a four-day week, focusing on hours per week instead. But Mr McDonnell said millions are exhausted from overwork and that must end.

The policy, which came from the grassroots, passed overwhemingly on conference floor and was endorsed by the Education Secretary Angela Rayner.In he speech she said Labour will make “the whole education system fairer through the integration of private schools”.It went further than the partyaposs plan to close the tax loopholes used by the elite private schools.  After a major push by left-wing members, Labour committed to work towards a net-zero carbon emissions target by . The ambitious plan won a vote at the partyaposs annual conference after days of isive debates over the target. The Labouraposs Socialist Green New Deal motion calls for the party to work towards a net-zero target for carbon emissions by .The GMB union, one of the three largest who are affiliated to Labour , have consistently opposed the  target throughout the conference which began on Saturday afternoon.Instead they want to see a less ambitious target because of concerns about potential job losses without a plan in place to adapt heavy industry. But itaposs still a lot more ambitious than the governmentaposs target of net zero emissions by . Hundreds of thousands of frail elderly people will get free care in their own homes under a Labour policy.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out plans for a National Care Service, which would more than double the number getting state-funded help in their old age. The new service, running alongside the NHS, is one of the key demands in the Mirror’s Fair Care For All campaign and would cost an estimated £billion in  . Those in need would get help with everyday tasks such as getting in and out of bed, bathing and washing, and preparing meals.    . Reparations for our colonial past Labour have begun outlining how they would make reparations for the UKaposs colonial past. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said that one way will be for the UK to share green technology with its former colonies. The policy comes out of the belief that the UK should take responsibility for the role its industrial legacy in polluting the world. It came after Shadow Women and Equalities Minister Dawn Butler also said there must be further reparations paid from slavery after Glasgow University agreed to make available £million. She said: Other banks and businesses must follow. Labour will begin with consultation hubs in Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow and London.  Thirty-seven new offshore wind farms will be builtLabour enters government, the party has pledged. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said there would be a % public stake in the farms, with profits invested into coastal communities.The cost of offshore wind tumbled below £ per megawatt hour of electricity last week, but Labour said deployment was too slow and that jobs and revenue were being taken outside the UK.Instead, under Labouraposs plans, a peopleaposs power fund would be created with % of the profits from the publicly owned stake, which would invest between £ to £, million each year into infrastructure in held-back coastal communities. The rest of the public profits would be reinvested into new renewables, improvements to the energy system and climate transition. Overall £billion would be invested over a decade in a peopleaposs power initiative from multiple sources. . End all food bank use within  years Labour has set a dramatic target to halve food bank use a year after Jeremy Corbyn enters Downing Street. And the party will aim to end the need for food banks completely within just three years of office. The ambitious pledges were unveiled after the number of emergency food parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust charity soared to .million last year. The targets will not be legally binding and food banks will not be shut down to meet them.But they would lay down the gauntlet to an incoming Prime Minister to stop Brits going hungry under a Labour government.Green-fingered Jeremy Corbyn will also oversee a £m fund for allotments - alongside other measures like community kitchens and healthy eating classes in  deprived areas. And Labour will announce plans for a Fair Food Act to ensure everyone in the UK has a legal right to food, similar to other human rights. The new law would create a National Food Commission - an independent body that could take legal action against the government or councilsthey breached peopleaposs rights.    . Ending almost all -month or less jail terms A future Labour government would legislate for a presumption to end ineffective super-short sentences of six months or fewer for non-violent and non-sexual offences. An independent review into how the justice system is handling rape would also be launched, Richard Burgon said, amid concerns over low conviction rates.

Outlining the mounting need for a snap poll, Mr Corbyn told Labour members the Brexit crisis could be only tackled by a new ballot, some  months after the country last went to the polls. He said: “This crisis can only be settled with a general election .“That election needs to take place as soon as this Government’s threat of a disastrous no-deal is taken off the table.” Revealing the battleground Labour wants to fight on, he rattled through popular policies such as renationalising the rail and water industries, along with the National Grid and Royal Mail. A new “Crossrail for the North” would link major cities across the region, stretching from Liverpool to Hull.    The hourly minimum wage would be hiked to £ and zero-hoursapos contracts would be scrapped. Three factories producing eco-friendly batteries would be built in South Wales, Stoke-on-Trent and Swindon. Within the first  days of a Labour Government, it would abolish the Trade Union Act, which critics say curbed workersapos rights. And Labour would ruthlessly target tax avoiders and evaders as it tries to pump cash into public coffers. Electric cars  Labour is ready to inject £.billion into building three huge battery factories to power a new fleet of electric cars. Mr Corbyn told party members the plants would open in Swindon, Stoke-on-Trent and South Wales. The move, under Labouraposs “Green New Deal” project, would help revive economies hit by factory closures and job losses in recent years. It would also help boost the fight against climate change as motorists switch from petrol and diesel-powered vehicles to more environmentally-friendly cars and vans. Earlier, delegates backed a plan for the party to work towards a net-zero carbon emissions target by . Employment  Zero-hoursapos contracts would be axed and the minimum wage raised to £ - with young people reaping the benefit. The current legal floor is £. for workers aged  and over, sinking to just £. for those under . The Labour chief said: “We’ll bring about the biggest extension of rights for workers our country has ever seen. We’ll scrap zero-hoursapos contracts introduce a £ living wage - including for young people from the age of  give all workers equal rights from their first day in the job take action on the gender, disability and ethnicity pay gaps and introduce flexible working time for workers experiencing the menopause.” Nationalisation  Delighted delegates lapped up renewed pledges to renationalise vast swathes of industry. Mr Corbyn told activists: “A Labour government will mean better wages, greater security, and more say - putting power in the hands of the people. And we’ll bring rail, mail, water and the National Grid into public ownership so the essential services that we all rely on are run by and for the public not for profit.” The Tories have faced widespread criticism for parts of their privatisation revolution, dating back to Margaret Thatcheraposs sapos heyday. Railways A new railway would be built across the North, linking Liverpool and Hull and pumping billions into the regional economy. Local leaders have repeatedly demanded better transport connections to help revitalise norther towns and cities. But critics say the region has been starved of cash while money is showered on cash-soaked London and the south. The Labour leader pledged: “Labour will invest in Crossrail for the North to link our great Northern cities, from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle in the North East.” Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: “The commitment of Jeremy Corbyn in his speech today to northern rail infrastructure east-west is to be welcomed, including both new lines and upgraded infrastructure as proposed by northern Mayors and leaders.”Buses A huge overhaul of buses would revive services in areas left cut off after vital lelines were axed. Greedy companies slashing services on non-profitable routes have meant passengers need to rely on cars or walk. Poor communities are disproportionately clobbered. Mr Corbyn promised to “restore the bus services that have been cut leaving people isolated from their communities”. The party had already unveiled plans to pump in £.billion a year to reverse cuts to local bus services as a way of boosting communities and helping the environment. Environment La our will wage war on “big polluters” as part of its drive to tackle the climate emergency. Mr Corbyn also pledged a “Green Industrial Revolution” with public investment in renewable energies and green technology. There will be seven-fold increase in offshore wind projects and a tripling of the amount of energy generated by solar power. The Labour leader insisted: Nothing matters more than the climate emergency. BrexitJeremy Corbyn underlined Labouraposs opposition to a no-deal Brexit by warning it would leave the country at the “mercy” of Donald Trump . He told delegates it would lead to a “race to the bottom” in standards and workersapos rights. “A no-deal Brexit is really a Donald Trump Brexit” he said. The Labour leader also insisted Labouraposs policy on Brexit was “not complicated.” A Labour government would negotiate a deal and within six months put that to the people in a second referendum alongside the option to remain. By putting the decision in the hands of the people Labour would bring the country together, he claimed."},{"url":null,"title":"labour wont trigger election until","story":"NewsLabour wont trigger election until theyve locked in blocking no-deal BrexitJeremy Corbyn tonight told Labour members there has to be an election after Boris Johnsons actions were ruled unlawful.

Parliament will now sit immediately from .am on Wednesday and Jeremy Corbyn rearranged his Labour conference speech to pm today to comply. In a historic judgement that will go down in British legal history,  justices said it was unlawful and extreme to shut down the Commons for five weeks just before Brexit. Declaring the prorogation of Parliament unlawful, void and of no effect, Supreme Court President Lady Hale quashed the Queenaposs order to shut down the Commons and declared: Parliament has not been prorogued. It triggered accusations that the Prime Minister misled the Queen and prompted Jeremy Corbyn to demand he consider his position and become the shortest-serving PM in history. So what does the momentous and unprecedented ruling say  Hereaposs a summary - and a guide to what happens next.   Supreme Court justices held a three-day hearing to decideBoris Johnson acted unlawfully when he prorogued - suspended - Parliament for a whole month. The PM claimed the shutdown from September  to October  was a standard way to hold a Queenaposs Speech with a new plan for Britain. But MPs say he misled the Queen - who ultimately approved the shutdown. Thataposs because it was much longer than usual and designed to shut them up over Brexit. Lord Pannick, QC for campaigner Gina Miller, said: No prime minister has abused his power in the manner in which we allege in at least the last  years. He told the Supreme Court: The Prime Ministeraposs motive was to silence parliament for that period - because he sees Parliament as an obstacle to the furtherance of his political aims. The case resolved two previous cases - one in England that ruled in Boris Johnsonaposs favour and one in Scotland that ruled against him.  All  sitting justices of the Supreme Court ruled vehemently and unanimously against the Prime Minister in pretty much the worst result he could have got. First of all, they totally rejected the governmentaposs claim that the matter was not justiciable - i.e., that it shouldnapost be decided by judges at all. Then, they ruled that the Prime Ministeraposs request for the Queen to prorogue Parliament was unlawful, because it had an extreme effect on democracy. And in a third and final blow, they actually quashed the Queenaposs order to prorogue itself, saying Parliament is not prorogued and it could now meet immediately. What more did the judgment say   Supreme Court President Lady Hale and the other  justices said the prorogation had the effect of frustrating Parliament and no justication had been given for it. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme, the ruling declared. This was not a normal prorogation in the run-up to a Queenaposs Speech. It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on October . Declaring the prorogation of Parliament unlawful, void and of no effect, Supreme Court President Lady Hale declared: Parliament has not been prorogued. Will Parliament now meet, and when   Yes. Speaker John Bercow confirmed Parliament would meet on Wednesday from .am. There will not be a Prime Ministeraposs Questions but there will be full scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates, he declared. The House of Lords will resume sitting at the normal Wednesday time of pm. Lord Speaker Norman Fowler said: The House of Lords performs a vital constitutional . It holds the Government of the day to account and will continue to do just that. MPs raced back to the Commons within minutes, with Tory Tom Tugendhat posing on the green benches and Labouraposs Stephen Doughty posting a photo of himself in the back of a taxi. Iaposm going to the airport now to make sure I can be back as soon as is possible, said Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson.  When Parliament meets on Wednesday its first act would normally be PMQs at noon. But Speaker John Bercow said that would be too short notice so in an exceptional move it will not go ahead. However, there will be full scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates under Standing Order  - a mechanism used to seize control of the Commons agenda. A Labour spokesman refused to rule out tabling a vote of no confidence in the government. Expect urgent questions and debates on the Prime Ministeraposs devastating blow in the Supreme Court itself. MPs are also expected to move on to plans they have been drawing up on a cross-party basis in private to hold the PM to account. They include closing possible loopholes in the law that prevents a no-deal Brexit on October . And they will demand more scrutiny of documents on prorogation and the governmentaposs no-deal plan Operation Yellowhammer. What are Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnsonaposs next moves   Both main party leaders were away from London when the ruling came and are rushing back urgently. Jeremy Corbyn was due to address Labouraposs party conference in Brighton at noon on Wednesday. But he moved forward his keynote speech to pm on Tuesday to get back on time. Meanwhile Boris Johnson was due to meet Donald Trump hours after the result, before addressing the UN General Assembly in New York at am UK time on Wednesday. A No source said he would fly back from New York early immediately after his address. He is due to touch down in the UK just before Parliament sits on Wednesday. The Tory conference in Manchester is still set to go ahead, starting this Sunday. Will Boris Johnson resign   A Downing Street source said the Prime Minister would refuse to resign. In his first comments since the historic ruling the Prime Minister said he strongly disagrees with any suggestion he should apologise. And he claimed Brexit would happen on October  - despite MPs passing a law to delay itthereaposs no deal.  Yet he faced mounting calls to quit from leaders of all the biggest opposition parties. Labour members chanted Johnson out! Johnson out! as Jeremy Corbyn said Boris Johnson must consider his position and become the shortest-serving Prime Minister thereaposs ever been. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Boris Johnson must resignhe has any honour left and he is not fit for office. And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson added: Boris Johnson has again proven he is not fit to be Prime Minister. Could he be impeached   An MP claims that, incredibly, he could. Impeachment is brought when a peer or MP is accused of high crimes and misdemeanours, beyond the reach of the law or which no other authority in the state will prosecute. It is a historic procedure which is largely considered obsolete. But Labour MP Liam Byrne has urged for it to be used against the Prime Minister. The MP tweeted: Mr Speaker has recalled the House for : tomorrow. Impeachment of Boris Johnson should begin immediately. If the Commons agree that the MP is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours then they are sent to the House of Lords chamber. The accused then stands at the bar at the House of Lords and is impeached. The first recorded impeachment was in  and the last in . Has the court ruled the PM misled the Queen   No, not directly. But it very heavily implies it. Boris Johnson is accused by campaigners of misleading the Queen - who gave the final order to prorogue - when he explained his reasoning. The justices slammed the Prime Minister for giving no justication for taking action with such an extreme effect. The only evidence of the PMaposs intentions, they said, was a memo from No legislative affairs chief Nikki da Costa that showed he was considering prorogation way back on August . That does not explain why it was necessary to bring Parliamentary business to a halt for five weeks, they said scathingly, when usually it was less than a week. With a lack of any explanation, judges were bound to conclude that the decision had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament doing its job. Thataposs the exact opposite of what Boris Johnson said it was for. Will todayaposs ruling stop Brexit   Not directly, no. Opening the hearing, Supreme Court President Lady Hale warned her ruling will not determine when and how the UK leaves the EU. She added: We are not concerned with the wider political histories which form the context for this legal issue. But the knock-on effect of the case will indirectly affect Brexit. It will undermine the PMaposs authority, add to calls for him to quit, and allow MPs to take further moves against his strategy. Will there still be a Queenaposs Speech   We still could. In order to bring in a new plan for government, Boris Johnson will still need a Queenaposs Speech. . And in order to have a Queenaposs Speech, Parliament does still have to be prorogued. Cabinet was due to hold a conference call at pm today to thrash out next steps. Those could involve proroguing Parliament again but for a much shorter period akin to the usual four or five days. What happens with Brexit  The Prime Minister -heaposs still in place - still needs to attend an EU summit on October . That will decide whether the UK has managed to secure a new Brexit deal with the EU amid all the chaos. If so it would come before Parliament for a vote. If not, then the law says Boris Johnson must request a three-month delay from the EU to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Who were the  Supreme Court judges   For only the second time in the courtaposs history, an -strong  of justices will hear the case - the first time being Mrs Milleraposs Article  case. Lady Hale, , was appointed the first female president of the Supreme Court in  after a ied career as an academic lawyer, law reformer and judge.

Dylan Hutchison, who had already paid for his stay, had to find new accommodation after the Dynastic Hotel told his family to either hand over more than £ or get out. The dad said managers were worried they would be aposbottom of the pileapos as a Thomas Cook creditor, the Daily Record reports. Mr Hutchison, , his we Charrelle, , and their son, Leo, five, had to leave the hotel as they did not have enough cash to meet bossesapos demands.    Along with pals Leigh Crombie, his partner Vicki Butchart and their son Archie, four, the gutted holidaymakers spent yesterday trying to find somewhere to sleep. They were among thousands of families caught up in the tour operator’s plunge into administration on Monday morning. And , tourists stranded worldwide are being brought back to the UK by the Civil Aviation Authorityunder Operation Matterhorn – a £million flight programme.  Dylan and his party, from Glenrothes, in Scotland, had flown from Edinburgh Airport to the Spanish resort last Wednesday for a week’s stay. They had booked the holiday last September and paid £, for each family-of-three. Dylan said: “It had been a great holiday until this happened. “Then we woke up and saw on the news that Thomas Cook had gone bust. We went to the hotel’s reception to try and check what was happening.    “We were then told by the head of reception thatwe didn’t pay €, for each of the families by pm, we would be removed from the hotel. She told us that was coming straight from the company director. “They claimed that was the hotel bill for the week even though we’d already paid Thomas Cook. “They said although we were Atol-protected, the hotel would be on the bottom of the pile to receive payment from any liquidators. “I contacted the CAA, who spoke to reception via my mobile phone but the hotel was adamant they were not accepting any guarantee of payment. It was pay €, or leave. “We didn’t have the money to pay it evenwe wanted to. “So we had to pack up our cases and hand over the room keys. We were left on the street.” The families went to a nearby bar to find shelter out of the C sunshine while they tried to find another place to stay. After a number of hours, they managed to find an apartment online costing £, along with a £ deposit, to stay in until they fly out.    Dylan, who works as a master technician, said: “It was all-inclusive package holiday with Thomas Cook which included meals, drinks and a shuttle transfer to Alicante Airport. “Our airline was easyJet so we’re told the flights back to Edinburgh Airport on Wednesday are still OK but we’ll have to get a taxi or something there. “We’ll also have to pay for food and everything until then. It’s ruined the holiday.” Last night the hotel said no one was available for comment. Transport Minister Michael Matheson MSP said: “We are saddened by the collapse of Thomas Cook which has a long history with many jobs in Scotland, the UK and overseas. “We are working closely with the UK Government and the CAA as the situation progresses and the CAA is providing detailed information for customers on their website, via a call centre and through representatives in the resorts and airports. “This will be a very worrying time for employees in Scotland, and Scottish staff based overseas, and we recognise these job losses will have a disproportionate impact on women.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former Virgin Airlines hostess drunkenly tried to punch a police officer after she was caught fair-dodging on a late night passenger train. Hannah Dyer, , accused one conductor of being racist and repeatedly branded him a f*****g c**t, after staff discovered she and her ex-boyfriend had not paid enough for their familyaposs rail travel home. As the pairaposs three children - aged four, three and eight months old - watched on, Dyer behaved asshe was possessed and had to be pulled back as she tried to manhandle the conductor. Police officers then met them when they arrived at Piccadilly railway station in Manchester, where Dyer lashed out at one officer and tried to punch another in the face whilst demanding to leave the . She was only spared arrest because her children were present, but was ordered to attend a police station the next day where she admitted her actions in an interview. It emerged that Dyer had been drinking strong cocktails earlier that afternoon after meeting a friend for lunch. The cost of an off-peakticket from Manchester to Leeds is £ but it is believed £. was paid for each ticket. At Manchester Magistratesapos Court, Dyer of Horwich, near Bolton, admitted a charge of travel beyond the distance paid for on railway, common assault and threatening behaviour - but was conditionally discharged for  months after she said she had been on medication at the time. She has now gone tee-total.    The incident occurred on April  this year after Dyer, her boyfriend and three children had enjoyed a family day out to the West Yorkshire city but using aticket from Huddersfield to Leeds. Richard Greenhough, prosecuting, told the court: She only had a West Yorkshire day , which wasnapost valid all the way to Manchester. When she arrived at Piccadilly the ticket would be incorrect. There were two conductors on the train who told the defendant about her ticket not being valid, to which she replied aposyouaposre a c..tapos on a number of occasions, adding aposYouaposre all the same youaposre a f*****g c**t youaposre a racistapos. Ticket conductors tried to calm her down but they were unable to and at one stage she leaned towards one of them and he thought she was trying to grab him, but her partner pulled her back. They described her behaviour as highly aggressive and said she could have been intoxicated as she seemed possessed. Mr Greenhough continued: When she arrived into Piccadilly, police were there to meet her and by this stage it was the early hours of the morning. Two officers spoke to the defendant but she was saying aposIaposve had enough of thisapos and tried to walk off from the . One officer put an arm out but she lashed out trying to punch him in the face, which he blocked with his arm. The other officer then tried to calm the defendant down but she lashed out at him too trying to punch him in the face, which was again blocked by the officeraposs arm.    A probation report read to the hearing said Dyer has very little recollection of the incident and is very remorseful, adding that while meeting an old friend for lunch she had four strong cocktails as part of a aposbuy one get one freeapos promotion. The report added: She used to work as an air hostess for Virgin Airlines and therefore has experience working in a customer service based job and has seen the other side. She appreciates her behaviour was totally unacceptable. She moved to Bolton from Dorset five years ago and split up with her partner  months ago but they have a good relationship and co-parent their three children. He now lives in London so she does feel somewhat isolated up here. She has three children under the age of five. When her second child was born she started struggling with anxiety and went to see a counsellor who put her on anti-anxiety medication. The court heard she is currently unemployed because she has young children, has no financial issues and is on housing benefit. She admits she had previously been something of a binge drinker, but not for a long period of time.    This was her first time drinking in almost three years and she hasnapost drunk since the incident and has no inclination to do so, the report continued. She is ashamed of what she has done. She strongly understands victim empathy and regrets what she did that day. Defence lawyer Mr Mumtaz Chaudry added: She has never been in court before and she should not have been involved in this. She was out shopping with her ex-partner and their three children. He had the ticket and therefore it was him who had the issue with the train conductors. She got involved when the conductor refused to update their ticket. She suffers from post-natal depression following the birth of her youngest. She is a single mother of three children, who are four, three and eight months. She recently changed her medication for depression and anxiety. Mr Chaudry said the mix of alcohol and medication made things worse, but said the incident was out of character and she fully accepts responsibility.

She took a break from wearing her ring at the start of this year while she was pregnant with Archie, and she was spotted without it at a number of occasions.However when she didit to her finger for the official photos after Archie was born in May the ring had a new look .  Meghan had her stunning ring, which features two diamonds from his mum  Princess Diana  aposs collection and one from Botswana, where he does a lot of charity work, resigned.Instead of the original thick gold band, the diamonds now sit on a much thinner micropavé band.The new gold ring wasnapost the only accessory the Duchess has been showing off during the Tour, and she wore a very special bracelet yesterday .The Duke and Duchess wore matching red and white beaded bracelets bearing the word aposJusticeapos, a nod to the charity they were visiting.

Kristine Barnett, , and Michael Barnett, , allegedly dumped their Ukrainian-born daughter Natalia Grace, who has dwarfism, in a flat in the US and moved to Canada. A doctor who examined Natalia in  - the year she was adopted - determined that she was eight-years-old, but in  the Barnetts - now orced - legally changed her age to . After being charged with neglect, Kristine has bizarrely claimed Natalia was an impostor pretending to be a child and tried to kill her in a plot mirroring the horror film The Orphan.    Kristine claims -ft tall Natalia threatened to stab her and her then-husband in their sleep, pushed her towards an electric fence and poured bleach in her coffee. Kristine told DailyMailTV: She would make statements and draw pictures saying she wanted to kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the backyard. “She was standing over people in the middle of the night. You couldnapost go to sleep. We had to hide all the sharp objects.  I saw her putting chemicals, bleach, Windex something like that, in my coffee and I asked her, aposwhat are you doing apos She said, aposI am trying to poison youapos. In an interview with WISH-TV, Kristine claimed Natalia was diagnosed as both a psychopath and sociopath. Kristine denied accusations that she neglected Natalia, and claims that Natalia is an adult and was not a child when she was adopted. She claims Natalia - initially said to be as young as six when she was adopted - had already started her period and was trying to cover it up, had adult teeth and full pubic hair.  She also claims doctors examined Natalia and concluded she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults. Kristine alleges the illness led to Natalia jumping from moving cars and smearing blood over mirrors. She claims the couple had Nataliaaposs age corrected after a physician told them Nataliaaposs  birth date was wrong and the daughter had made a career out of pretending to be a young child. Natalia suffers from a rare form of dwarfism that means she is ft tall and has problems walking.    Because of her condition it has been dficult for doctors to determine her age. When she was adopted it was claimed she was six. In  a doctor said she was about eight, and an evaluation in  showed that she was a minor aged about  or , according to a police affidavit. The Barnetts had Nataliaaposs age changed to  and later rented an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, in  and left her there alone, according to police.  The foster parents moved to Canada with their two sons, where one of them was attending a prestigious physics school west of Toronto. Police have now charged the Barnetts with neglect, claiming Natalia was abandoned. According to the affidavit, Michael admitted to police that he and Kristine had Nataliaaposs age changed to  even though doctors had determined she was a minor. The document states: Michael Barnett admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looked young but was actually .  One of the coupleaposs friends back in Indiana told TV station News  that the Barnetts were scammed into adopting the girl. The friend, who wasnapost named, said: She just found out two weeks ago through the media that sheaposs in trouble. She said there were two trials years ago to re-age the girl. It wasnapost like its something the state doesnapost know happened. Sheaposs very confused as to why all of this were to come up.

Krystal Wall, , had struggled with her weight from a young age and had to battle years of verbal abuse - including taunts suggesting she would never find a man while that size. But after the weight loss, she says her friend cruelly told her she had only been pals with her because she was another fat girl. The stay-at-home mum, who married her husband Grant when she was , revealed how on her honeymoon she was so embarrassed by her size that she pretended to be scared of horses in order to avoid revealing she was over the weight limit to ride. Krystal was eating between , and , calories each day, which would typically include two bowls of cereal, big plates of pasta and cheese, cheeseburgers, fries and chocolate brownies. I was st lb at my heaviest and I was miserable, depressed and really hated the way I looked, she said. I was constantly preoccupied about the way other people must have thought about me.    This was one of the hardest things. Iaposd sit in a room and look at everyone and wonderI was the biggest one there. I was constantly trying to sit, walk or stand in a way that made me look as small as possible and this was a huge hindrance on just being able to enjoy le.

She started counting calories and exercising daily, before eventually starting a keto diet - high-fat, adequate protein and very low carbs - in December . Krystalaposs average calorie intake has plummeted to , per day, and she now fasts for breakfast, has salad with chicken, tuna or beef for lunch, with meat and vegetables in the evenings. She also goes to the gym at am each morning and does over an houraposs cardio, as well as sometimes hiking, cycling or swimming.    The American, who now weighs just st lbs and is a size , said: The weight loss has changed my le and even enhanced all the things that were already good about living. I have so much energy now for my children and Iaposm enthusiastic about being active. Iaposm far more productive. Iaposm comfortable in my own skin which is something Iaposve never experienced before. I now love to go on adventures, meet new people and take on new physical challenges.    The mother-of-two, who has been married for  years, said that she now feels like she can trust herself, as she finally fulfilled her promise to herself that she would lose enough weight to feel healthy. Now I finish what I say I will, and I go to bed each night feeling proud and thankful, she added.

The patient was in a clinic in South Korea for a routine appointment, but instead awoke still under anaesthetic to find she was no longer pregnant. Authorities say the woman, who was six weeks pregnant, was supposed to be having a nutritional shot at the treatment centre.However a mix-up over her medical charts and failure to check her identity led to her having the termination, reports CNN .   The doctor and nurse in charge have acknowledged their fault and now face an accusation off negligence resulting in bodily harm, a Gangseo Police official told media. The nurse is alleged to have injected the woman with anaesthesia without checking her identity, and the doctor had performed the abortion without checking either. Police reportedly announced the investigation on Monday and will be referring the case to the prosecutoraposs office. This April South Koreaaposs courts overturned a -year ban on abortion. The landmark ruling said the law banning terminations curbed womenaposs rights and was unconstitutional.

With only Mark Reynolds a stick-on starter, there are big decisions to be made over the fitness of new boy Troy Brown or whether to opt for Paul Watson or midfielder Calum Butcher against the Red Lichties.Going for the latter in central defence would likely see Ian Harkes come into the midfield.And the American’s inclusion would be a welcome one, in my opinion.His impact in the derby win over Dundee was clear, not only with his goal but overall play.Up top, Louis Appere has impressed but when Nicky Clark came on at Ayr he looked lively and is a proven scorer at this level.Much to ponder as United look to remove the spoke from their wheel and get back on the title charge."},{"url":null,"title":"joy for dundee united fan after lawrence shankland accepts marriage proposal","story":"A Twitter user has shared a picture of him #proposing# to Dundee United striker Lawrence Shankland.mdash andy crichtonSeptember , Hundreds of people have liked the tweet by user Andy Crichton, who pictured himself with the player holding a candy wedding ring, with the caption: #He only went and said yes##Shankland scored twice in four minutes to seal an unlikely win for United against Arbroath on Saturday, his second goal coming deep into injury time .A number of well-wishers congratulated the United fan for his #proposal#.Shankland has scored an impressive  goals in  games for United this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shock as driver flips car in city street before fleeing the scene","story":"Residents of a city street say they are “amazed” no one was seriously injured after a car overturned in the early hours of yesterday.Police and fire crews closed off Fountainbleau Drive in Linlathen shortly after am to clear the scene and cut down a lamppost damaged in the smash.A police investigation has been launched in an effort to trace the driver who ditched the car.It is understood the vehicle may have been stolen from the Kirkton area before the crash.Neighbours said they saw three young men wearing dark clothing who fled the area shortly after the incident.An unnamed resident said the yellow Vauxhall came to a stop near the skate park before she contacted the fire service. vw, px\"  She said: “I’m amazed no one was seriously injured.“The car landed on its driver’s side and I contacted the fire brigade – I was worried the car might have gone up in flames.”Another neighbour confirmed she had witnessed a group flee the scene.She added: “I’m amazed they came out of that unscathed.”Another resident described hearing a “loud bang” and said he couldn’t understand how the car had ended up landing in that position, near the junction with Rowantree Crescent.He added: “There was no screeching to imply the car was out of control.“It was facing in the direction of Morrisons but it was on the wrong side of the road to be heading that way.“I can’t understand how it’s managed to end up like that.“There were at least  fire crew members on the scene before a lamppost was cut down.”The fire service confirmed two appliances from the Kingsway station attended the scene.Police have urged anyone who may be able to help their investigation to get in touch.A spokeswoman added: “Officers were called to Fountainbleau Drive in Dundee at around .am yesterday following a one-car collision.“The driver had left the scene prior to police arrival and inquiries are ongoing to trace them.“Anyone who witnessed the crash or has other information relevant to the investigation should contact police on .”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Millions of people in more than  countries will walk out of their work, homes and colleges and spend a day demanding action on the climate emergency.I hear that many in Lochgilphead High School are planning to do the same # well done!Let us join them on Friday September  between am and pm to help build a future fit for all living beings.Mary Stirling, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"special year for lochgilphead swi","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Scottish Women#s Institute ladies are celebrating the group#s th birthday this year.A special meal attended by guests from other institutes and the Scottish president Linda Retson will take place in December to mark the occasion.The group#s new session starts on Tuesday September .

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add much.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-man-wrongly-claimed-thousands-pounds-benefits","story":"William Stewart, of Winton Park, knowingly made  declarations to officials at the Department for Work

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"Labour s self-destructing Brexit policy     negotiate and reject     is incoherence on stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in . Of course, I sympathise. I would revoke Article  tomorrow,I had the choice. But you simply cant tell people that their vote in a referendum is to be ignored, cast aside, because they werent clever enough to understand what they were voting for.UK voters were promised in  that their decision would be honoured, not least in the millions of government leaflets put through their doors. The LibDems claim to be the great champions of civil liberties and human rights, yet they are prepared to abandon the most important right of all: the right to vote.We now know what would have happened in Scotland had voted for independence. The Liberal Democrats, who were in government at the time with the Tories, would simply have just rejected it. Impossible to implement. Scots didnt know what they were voting for. Chaos wasnt on the ballot paper.So the LibDems have made an egregious error, but this doesnt mean that Labours policy is much better. It is marginally more democratic, at least in offering voters a choice. But what a choice.Jeremy Corbyn says that he will negotiate a new and better Brexit than the Tories. Britain would remain in the EU Customs Union with the closest possible alignment with the European Single Market. Britain would retain all the work place and environmental protections that Theresa May offered to add to her Withdrawal Agreement that Labour rejected.Under Labours plan the UK would therefore remain under the rules of the single market, overseen by the European Court of Justice, and would have all trade policy set by Brussels. Now, Im not knocking this. It is essentially the Norway option of remaining in the European Economic Area that was rejected by parliament in March. However, just how would this look to a Brexit voter Labour is proposing to put Remain and their Norway Plus as the only choices in their Final Say referendum. But is that really a choice  It sounds like Remain v Leave-in-name-only. Thinking back to the Scottish vote, it would be like holding an independence referendum in which the choices were: Remain in the UK versus Federalism. That would have been condemned, rightly, because independence supporters were denied any say.I am a supporter of remaining in the European Union. I have long argued that the Norway option is the obvious compromise. But it seems to me inconceivable that a referendum on leaving the European Union could exclude the option of, er, leaving the European Union. What are they thinking The trouble with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats is that theyrsquore talking to themselves. Brainwashed by their social media feeds, they think that Brexiteers are a species of bigots who dont deserve to have the vote at all. Some academics have actually said that there should be an educational qualication before people are allowed to vote.But this isnt the worst of Labours Brexit policy. Mr Corbyn first has to negotiate his ldquocredible Leave option\", a bespoke deal that allows the UK to have all the benefits of membership of the European Single Market without actually being a formal member of it. But Labours Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, say theyll campaign for Remain in the Final Say, against their own partyrsquos policy.What is Brussels going to say  Well, Mr Corbyn, we really dont see why we should be bending over backwards, sideways and upside down in order to offer a deal that your lot are going to reject in a referendum. Thank you for coming.If Labour get a deal that meets all their criteria on jobs, environment, trade, free movement etc, so why on earth would they vote against their own negotiating triumph, their own policy  ldquoWe the Labour Party have reached an agreement with the European Union that gives us everything we asked for, so we are going to reject this disgraceful sell-out.Not so much a Final Say as Famous Last Words. No wonder Fiona Bruce was confused on Question Time. This incoherence explains why Labour has been overtaken by the Liberal Democrats in the latest YouGov opinion poll.The opposition have lost the plot on Brexit. Its not a good look when political parties make fools of themselves. Im almost tempted to say: come back Theresa May, all is forgiven. Perhaps the Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock, is right: Labour should have voted for Mays compromise, or at the very least abstained, when they had the chance.Her Withdrawal Agreement is the best that Brussels was prepared to offer, and she conceded quite a lot to Labour on employment rights and the environment. The UK was going to be allowed to remain, effectively, in the single market and customs union until a new trade deal was negotiated. The idea that the EU would offer more to Jeremy Corbyn, only for his party to reject it, is for the birds.Boris Johnson is clearly going to bring back a version of Mays Withdrawal Agreement, sans the Irish Backstop, even though it was rejected three times in parliament. And yes, I know it wasnt rejected solely over the backstop, but times change. Anyway, there will still be a backstop, only it will have moved to the Irish Sea in Boriss cunning plan. But parliament is going to have to take a good look at itself when this is put before MPs on October .The Benn Act, that compels the government to avoid no-deal, will surely be null and voidparliament rejects the only deal on offer. The only certainty then will be Article , which triggers Britains departure from the European Union whether or not there is a deal. MPs voted by a majority of  to trigger Article  in . They have voted down every alternative since then.I dont actually believe that Boris Johnson wants a crash-out Brexit: he is proud that he has managed to get movement from Brussels. But make no mistake. If parliament continues to preicate, and fails to come up with a majority for any kind of compromise, then Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October . It is irresponsible to demand a further extension of Ait is to no purpose.It sickens me to say it, but there is a half-decent Brexit deal on offer and MPs will have to think very carefully before rejecting it. The alternative will not be revoking A, or a referendum, both of which have been rejected by MPs. The alternative will be a hard-right Brexit. And parliament will be as much to blame as Boris Johnson."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10451354.jpg?type=article-full","title":"alarm-one-three-bank-scottish-branches-shut-four-and-a-half-years","story":"The research from the consumer organisation Which  also shows that many of those that remain now offer limited opening times for customers \"already struggling\" from reduced bank access.Investigating the bank branch network in Scotland between January  and August , Which  found that a \"staggering\"  branchesshut down as banks continued to close branches at an alarming rate - cutting the overall branch network from , to just .It also found that Scottish customers already struggling with a \"devastated\" branch network can also now face \"severely curtailed\" opening times.It found that  branches open just one day a week, while  are open for just two.And one in sevenonly open three days a week or less.Which  wants government action to ensure that millions of people who rely on it as a payment method are not left behind as digital payments grow in popularity.:Poorest Scots hit hardest bycash machineexodusAnd it said that with around a third of the population still not using online banking, banks should explore more innovative ways to ensure those who rely on face-to-face banking are able to access it.Jenny Ross, money editor of Which  said: ldquoBanks are closing their branches at an alarming rate in Scotland, which risks shutting many people out of vital financial services and their ability to access their own cash.ldquoBank branches play a crucial role within communities - serving consumers and businesses alike.

It will help ndashevery single one of us change our lestyle ndash but alone, inidual action is inadequate.The aim of the climate strikes is simple ndash to save the planet. If wersquore serious about that ndash and why wouldnrsquot we be ndash we need to face the fact that we have to radically alter the way we run our societies and economies. The bottom line is: we need to consume less as people and nations. That may sound easy, but it isnrsquot ndash it will entail massive disruption to our lives and economies. The challenge is: are we brave enough to accept these changes to make the world safe for our grandchildren :Operation to bring home stranded Thomas Cook customers to cost up to poundmWe fixate on oil and gas astheyrsquore the only demons in the climate change debate. The energy industry is certainly the greatest polluter of the planet by far, but we forget that farming produces .% of the worldrsquos carbon emissions. It takes  litres of water to make one litre of milk. Road travel alone accounts for .% of emissions. Deforestation .%. Cement production produces % of the worldrsquos carbon emissions. The chemical industry creates .%, printing .%.So the great problem to be figured out is: how do we rein in production and consumption in order to tackle climate change, while still maintaining economic growth, the guiding light of every government The collapse of the travel company Thomas Cook sits slap bang in the middle of this debate. Of course, Thomas Cook wasnrsquot destroyed by consumer choice linked to climate change ndash it collapsed due to commercial challenges from internet rivals. But the collapse proves two things: firstly, people arenrsquot travelling less, theyrsquore just travelling more cheaply with online companies not high street ones. So even as climate change becomes the biggest global issue, people are still not changing their lestyles in any meaningful way. They might recycle but cutting out a holiday  No thank you.Secondly, can we face more losses like Thomas Cook in order to tackle the climate threat  If we do become serious about change ndashwe feel production and consumption must be reined in to lower carbon emissions ndash then wersquoll inevitably have to face some companies suffering and perhaps closing. Is the answer a dreadful utilitarian choice: will some peoplersquos lives have to be ruined today to save the planet for the rest of us tomorrow Letrsquos look at lsquofast fashionrsquo as a case study. Cheap disposable clothing is a major problem when it comes to climate. The United Nations says the fashion industry creates % of all global carbon emissions. Are we comfortable with a high street fashion chain going under as a casualty of our climate struggle  Are we OK with people losing their jobs  Are we happy with the knock-on effect  For every redundant shop worker there will be fewer sandwiches sold in delis, fewer drinks in pubs after work. Less money.This brings us to the issue of lsquodegrowthrsquo ndash the biggest dilemma which we must debate as we try to go forward and tackle climate change. If you read economists whorsquove put their minds to the question of how we fix a planet which is at risk due to overproduction and overconsumption, therersquos little escape from the logical answer: we need to accept a limit to economic growth.This is a hard battle to fight. Degrowth can and will be portrayed by business and industry as a recipe for poverty. Itrsquos also an almost impossible sell to the public. Humans are inherently self-interested and short-termist ndash we canrsquot think of the next decade let alone next century. And the governments we elect are precisely the same.:Young people have a right to be listened to on climate crisisHowever, the other side of the argument is that recalibrating the economy away from oil and gas to green energy could trigger new economic opportunities. New energy sources like renewable hydrogen may well create new jobs. The narrative doesnrsquot need to be about decline and redundancies.With will and ingenuity, we could do the same for other industries like food, fashion and travel. But that takes fierce collective action, and we need a paradigm sht in our thinking. Some say that the move toward a green world will take a step-change in human consciousness along the lines of the leap from kingship to democracy. When Athens started playing with democracy in the sixth century BC, the rest of the ancient world thought the city demented. The idea that rulers were servants of the people seemed absurd.Can the intellectual leap we need to take to deal with the climate happen overnight  It seems impossible.And we are yet to properly debate the fact that many parts of the developing world are still going through industrialisation while we in the Global North obsess ndash rightly ndash over climate change. Is it fair that Western nations which had their industrial revolutions  years ago should tell poorer countries not to develop No philosopher, economist, or political thinker has answered these questions. There has even been discussion around lsquogreen authoritarianismrsquo ndash the idea that only a strongman-style of government, which tramples over inidual rights, could achieve the goal of forcing people, society and industry to change in order to save the planet in the time we have left to take meaningful action.What climate protestors have done is start a conversation. The people have called for action. Now governments must respond with policies and put them to the people. Then wersquoll find outall of us who say we care about the climate are willing to accept the necessary sacrices needed to save the planet.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-signalman-oran-mor-five-stars","story":"The SignalmanOran Mor, GlasgowMary Brennanfive starsOn December th it will be  years since the Tay Rail Bridge disaster, when both the track and a passenger train plunged into the river below.

To achieve this, Labour would remove independent schoolsrsquo charitable status ndash something the Scottish Government has been consulting on for much of this year ndash redistribute their endowments, investments and properties to the state sector, and require all universities to take just seven per cent of their students from independent establishments, reflecting the make-up of the wider population.It was just the kind of posturing that Corbynistas have been crying out for and, with the anticipation being that the policy,ever enacted, would spell the end of private schools altogether, the Abolish Eton campaign greeted it with jubilation. Campaign organiser Holly Rigby, a state school teacher who had helped push the issue up the partyrsquos agenda, called it a ldquoreally big victory for the left, adding that ldquothis is a really positive moment for the Labour Party because itrsquos the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. Itrsquos a really radical commitment as well.But how much of a victory can Labourrsquos motion really be when all it does is make private schools the problem that needs to solved rather than addressing the very real issues that hold back too many in the state sector too  Is the policy really worth crowing about when, far from making all state schools that little bit better, it may actually stand more of a chance of making them that little bit more crowded, that little bit more stretched and so that little bit worse It is a lie perpetually spun by those running private schools that what they offer is a superior education when in fact all they provide is an expensive, resource-rich and selective one. Indeed, study after study has shown that when things like socio-economic status are controlled for, the type of school a child attends has little or no impact on their academic attainment. Yet while it would be nice to imagine a wider distribution of the little things that set private-school kids apart ndash the polish of one-to-one tuition, the confidence of knowing your opportunities are endless ndash the opposite is likely to be true in a state-school-only world. Parents, after all, are hardly likely to continue paying for an education that has been taken over by the state, while without parental funding the ability for schools to provide those things will disappear.Given that state-school kids are every bit as capable of achieving academic success as their privately educated peers, some may feel that removing the added extras that money has bought for the latter may be enough to level the playing field in and of itself. Nothing could be further from the truth, though. Because while capability is one thing, actuality is another, and the vast dferences that exist within the state-school sector are way more pernicious, and way more worthy of addressing, than those that have grown up between it and the private one.Indeed, while it cannot be right that the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews ndash all of which are renowned for propelling graduates into the best of careers ndash take per cent of their students from private schools, neither can be it right that state-educated children in the poorest parts of the country are left trailing behind those from wealthier backgrounds. The fact the Scottish Government-funded Growing up in Scotland study found children from low-income families to be  months behind their more affluent peers in vocabulary skills and  months behind in problem-solving skills on day one of school is unacceptable, but closing down private schools will have no positive impact on that.Yes, Labourrsquos plan to require universities to address their admissions policies is long overdue ndash and some institutions are already taking action off their own bats to do just that. But unless something drastic is done to close the poverty-related attainment gap, only wealthier state kids, whose parents may well have paid a premium to live close to supposedly \"good\" publicly funded schools, will stand to benefit. And while seizing and selling swathes of valuable land owned by the likes of Eton College may seem like a good way to fund the closing of that gap ndash and it would certainly win the votes of those on the hard left ndash does anyone really believe they would give it up without a long and costly fight  What would happen to attainment in the meantime There is no doubt that British society is as unequal today as it has been at any time in its history, with the rich continuing to get richer while the poor go on getting poorer. Private schools, which send their pupils down gilded paths that equally bright and equally talented children from poorer backgrounds are too often excluded from, undoubtedly have a part to play in that.But the solution to social inequality does not lie in eradicating every privilege enjoyed by the wealthy when they will simply be able to use their wealth to find ways to overcome that. Yes, it is right to expect private schools to pay their fair share of taxes and, yes, universities and workplaces should be required to reflect the make-up of the population at large, but abolishing private schools altogether  Thatrsquos just a distraction.If the Labour Party really wanted to be radical,it really wanted to score a big victory for the left, it would focus on finding ways to make schools at the bottom of the educational tree better, rather than trying to make those at the top worse."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-citizens-assembly-climate-change","story":"In fact since the Scottish Governmentrsquos declaration of climate emergency in April, there has been no discernible addition to plans that were indicated months ago.

Millions of people hit the streets around the world on Friday calling for action over climate change, and the demonstrations will continue this week. At home, marches and protests are ubiquitous now with citizens fired up over Brexit and Scottish independence.Protest can led to war and revolution, or peaceful people-powered democratic change. Wherever governments enact laws which the people donrsquot like, there will be demonstrators on the streets. Here we look at the history of protest. What triggers mass protests  What makes a protest successful  Why do they fail  And what happens when they spin out of control The plebs rise upThe first recorded protest in history was the Secessio Plebis ndash the Withdrawal of the Plebs ndash in ancient Rome in  BC. The plebs ndash Romersquos working class ndash were at the bottom of the social pile, with the city ruled by Patrician aristocrats. The plebs wanted voting rights, and a fairer form of government.So, in what was effectively a general strike, the plebs walked out of the city en masse, and decamped to a nearby mountain, leaving the Patricians to fend for themselves. Given that the plebs kept Rome running on a day to day basis, the Patricians were in trouble.The timing couldnrsquot have been worse asRome was also at war with local tribes. The Patricians relented, writing off some plebeian debts and creating the office of Tribune of the Plebs. This was the first official position a pleb could hold in Rome, and its creation began the widening of rudimentary democracy in the Roman republic.The peasants revoltThe Black Death of - changed the face of society forever. One of the biggest disruptions came in the job market. With so many peasants dead from plague, surviving workers could demand higher wages, chipping away at the power of the rich.By the summer of  in England, this newly confident working class was growing increasingly angry over the introduction of a ldquopoll tax to fund the Hundred Yearsrsquo War with France. When attempts were made in Essex to collect unpaid taxes, large-scale protests broke out, and there were violent confrontations.A party of protesters led by Wat Tyler set off for London to meet with royal officials to demand tax cuts and the end of serfdom. Negotiations didnrsquot go well. The king, -year-old Richard II, hid in the Tower of London as most of his troops were abroad. The peasants entered London and violence erupted as locals joined the protesters. The Savoy Palace was burned, and the Lord Chancellor and Lord High Treasurer were murdered. Londoners who resented foreigners in the city used the revolt as an excuse to attack Flemish workers.The king agreed to most demands, and later went to meet Tyler. However, after behaving in a way deemed overly familiar ndash he called the king ldquobrother ndash Tyler was stabbed to death. The king immediately broke his promises and began a military crackdown. An army of , put down unrest across the country, and by the end of the year , rebels and protesters were dead.The Boston Tea PartyBy the s, the American colonies were in a state of outrage over the imposition of tax on imported tea levied by the British parliament. Boston in Massachusetts, which imported the most tea to America, was a hotbed of anger. The tax was seen as a grave breach of the rights of colonists who believed that as they had no elected representatives in the British parliament, then the Commons shouldnrsquot impose taxes on America. Their slogan was ldquono taxation without representation.In December , some , people, out of an estimated population of ,, were protesting on the streets of Boston, as a number of British tea ships sat in port. Protesters wanted the tea ships toto England. On December , the secret society the Sons of Liberty ndash some disguised as Native Americans ndash boarded the ships and dumped  chests of tea overboard.The British Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts ndash punitive laws which took away the right of self-governance in Massachusetts ndash and the spark was lit which would go on to ignite the American War of Independence in .The Peterloo massacreDemocracy in the Britain of the early s was a joke best summed up by Rotten Boroughs like the constituency of Old Sarum which had one voter but elected two MPs. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars in , there was also widespread unemployment, hunger and poverty.Protesters in Manchester wanted reform, and on August , , a crowd of up to , people had gathered at St Peterrsquos Field demanding political change. Local magistrates called in the Yeomanry to arrest ringleaders including Henry Hunt. In the commotion, a child was killed, and mounted Hussars were sent in to disperse the crowd. The cavalry charged with sabres drawn and  people were killed, with  more injured. John Lees, who was injured and later died of his wounds, was a veteran of the Battle of Waterloo.As he lay dying, he said: ldquoAt Waterloo there was man to man, but there it was downright murder. His comments earned the massacre its bloody name.The incident is seen as one of the defining moments of British history and a turning point for the rise of the left.Gandhirsquos salt marchMahatma Gandhi brought the fight for Indian independence to the worldrsquos attention with a mass protest and campaign of peaceful civil disobedience centred around salt. Britain had a monopoly on salt production in India. Officials could break into premises making salt and seize it. Gandhi saw salt as symbolic of the most basic human needs and chose to use it as a stick to beat the British Empire.On March , , Gandhi began a -day ldquoSalt March with  trusted followers. By April , millions of Indians were inspired to acts of civil disobedience across the country.The worldrsquos press was fascinated by the protest and obsessed by Gandhi, who famously broke laws against making salt during the protest march, with the words: ldquoWith this I am shaking the foundations of the British empire. Gandhi was arrested and interned, and the British cracked down violently on protesters. Reporters were stunned by the peaceful behaviour of demonstrators. ldquoNot one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows, wrote US journalist Webb Miller. Over , people were eventually jailed. India would finally gain its independence in .I have a dreamThe zenith of the African-American civil rights movement came on a warm Wednesday in Washington on August , . The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom saw , people fill the centre of the US capital demanding civil rights for black America.It was at the demonstration that Martin Luther King Jr gave his ldquoI have a dream speech ndash ranked as one of the most important in political history. The march led to the passing of the Civil Rights Act in  which outlawed discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, sex or nationality.In March , the Selma to Montgomery Marches in Alabama saw King once again side by side with protesters demanding voting rights for African-Americans. Civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot by police and died, and state troopers brutally attacked demonstrators. The world was shocked ndash and the Voting Rights Act was passed later that year.Civil rights in IrelandInspired by black activists in America, the Northern Ireland civil rights movement blossomed in the mid-s. Protesters wanted an end to discrimination against Catholics when it came to jobs, housing, and gerrymandered elections which discriminated against nationalists.Protest marches were banned, demonstrators were beaten by police and riots broke out. As unrest worsened, killings began. Hundreds were wounded and Catholics were driven from their homes. The British army arrived to help keep the peace. The Troubles were now under way.Internment without trial was introduced and civil-rights marchers took to the streets of Derry on January , , in protest. The day would go down in history as Bloody Sunday.France Left-wing and student anger over the state of France, capitalism and Vietnam erupted in protest in May  and left the country on the brink of revolution. Students began occupying universities and then strikes broke out. Some  million people ndash one-fth of the French population ndash went on strike continuously for two weeks.Politicians feared civil war, and President Charles de Gaulle even fled to Germany,only for a few hours, threatening the total collapse of law and order. Violent street battles broke out between police and protesters, and barricades went up.When de Gaulle ed from Germany he called new elections and the violence wound down. When votes were counted, de Gaulle was in an even stronger political position than he had been before protests began.Alain Geismar, a leading Soixante-Huitard, as veterans of the  protests are known, says that the movement may have failed politically, but it was a success in the way it changed French society by showing the government the power of ordinary people.Tiananmen SquareWith mass protests threatening communist regimes in eastern Europe, the Chinese one-party state was in no mood to tolerate demands by pro-democracy activists in Beijing in . Students began protesting for political reforms, including freedom of the press and freedom of speech. At the height of the protests around one million people were gathered in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing.Protests spread across China and the Communist Party declared martial law, sending , troops into Beijing. On June , troops advanced through the city killing protesters and bystanders. The death toll is estimated in the several thousands.The protests were summed up in one of the most iconic images of the th century, Tank Man. On June , the morning after protests were suppressed, an unidentied demonstrator stood in front of a row of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square. The man was led away ndash his fate remains unknown.Tiananmen Square help secure the Communist Partyrsquos grip on power, and ensured Chinarsquos status as a human-rights pariah.The Iraq warBetween January  and April , , it is estimated that  million people across the world took part in around , demonstrations against the Iraq War.The largest demos came on February , just a month before the US-UK invasion. The protests took place in around  countries and  cities with up to  million people on the streets. They led one commentator to say there were only two superpowers on the planet: America, and public opinion.Tony Blair was in Scotland on the day of the February  demo, and Labour tried to hinder protesters demonstrating outside the SECC in Glasgow where the party was having its annual conference. Blair rescheduled the timing of his speech to avoid protesters who claimed they ldquochased Blair out of town.The protests failed to stop the war. Iraq was invaded on the grounds that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction ndash a claim now known to be a lie. An estimated , Iraqi civilians died, and Blair trashed his place in the history books.The Arab SpringIt began with a Tunisian street vendor called Mohamed Bouazizi who burned himself alive in December  in protest at being hounded and harassed by the authorities. Protesters sick of the authoritarian regime took to the streets and eventually Tunisiarsquos leader, president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, stepped down after  years in power.Protests against oppression and poor living standards spread across North Africa and the Middle East to Libya, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Algeria, and a dozen other nations. The regional uprising led to the fall and death of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. Hosni Mubarak was ousted in Egypt.The Arab Spring triggered the Yemeni civil war and the war in Syria which has cost an estimated half a million lives. The bloodshed that resulted from the Arab Spring was dubbed The Arab Winter. Only in Tunisia, where the protests began, has democracy taken hold.Women marchOn January , , one day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, more than seven million women took to the streets in America and  other countries.Trump had caused outrage with boasts caught on tape of sexually touching women, and other derogatory and sexists comments directed at women. The aim of the Womenrsquos March was to tell the president and other world leaders that ldquowomenrsquos rights are human rights.In Washington, , protesters took to the streets, while across America the total was over five million. There were marches on all seven continents, including one demonstration in Antartica. Crowds were peaceful and playful ndash the demos spawned the now famous ldquoPussyhat ndash and there were zero arrests.Some of the most famous women in the world took part including Cher, Madonna, Julia Roberts, Rihanna, Helen Mirren, Jane Fonda, Natalie Portman and Ariana Grande."},{"url":null,"title":"SKETCH   Come into my web  said the law to the PM","story":"ldquoI can only apologise, said Victoria Derbyshire, whose BBC morning show had been interrupted to go live to Little St George Street in Westminster for the verdict.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"four fifths of our carbon footprint is down to our consumption habit","story":"Businesses that don#t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind.That’s the warning from Zero Waste Scotland which says organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items just to stay in the race – and urges them to embrace the circular economy.Zero Waste Scotland stresses firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint. This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective. From IPCC  Report , Summary for Policymakers, Paragraph SPM .. .“Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale#, and.#Effective mitigation will not be achievedinidual agents advance their own interests independently.#The current, tawdry campaign is disreputable. It is based on Old Testament-style, apocalyptic prophecies, cynically intended to raise public alarm for grubby, political purposes and the Green Party is up to their ocksters in it. By far themost numerous deaths will be due to cold # excess winter deaths .Stick with international action, informed by IPCC science, please.Le is better when folk agree the dferences between people matter less than what we have in common. The attitude John Inkster appears to demonstrate is far more of a threat to the strength of Shetland culture than taking pride in the outward-looking, open-minded, warm-hearted and welcoming nature of most of his fellow islanders. Shetland folk music would never have developedthose playing it only ever stuck to listening to and playing the original tunes.Let’s remember the accordions came in fae sooth. If, in times past, the small-hearted and narrow-minded had called the tune, well there certainly would not have been so much Shetland culture to celebrate.Shetland culture has always developed in relation to other influences. There is nothing to fear that won’t be made worse by treating new Shetlanders or unken folk as undesirable.Accordions and fiddles are indeed dferent. What matters is what they can achieve together. Would that John, John and indeed John could dance to a dferent tune.Put simply, as long as humans put the concept of money, greed and profits ahead of anything , many of the problems of the environment caused by human activity will never be dealt with in a way which is harmonious not only to human le, but le and the environment as well.The driving force to human and social development is based on a system which is at odds and against the natural laws of nature. As long as this is the case, very little,anything at all, progress will be made to reduce the damage and destruction of natural habitat and the mass extinction of le continuing until it is too late#. like many situations where a disaster has been created before improvements are made, and the usual # If only we knew in the first place reaction #.Is it not disturbing that the most intelligent form of leon the planet is also the planets nemisis .."},{"url":null,"title":"various vacancies at shetland islands council 2 ","story":"• Auxiliary – LerwickIf you don’t have access to the internet or have a disability which prevents you from applying online, please call  .We are an Equal Opportunities Employer, and encourage Remote and Flexible Working."},{"url":null,"title":"bereavement support volunteers receive certificates for their efforts ","story":"The SBSS award ceremony at the Sound Hall on Saturday evening.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Boris Johnson has lied to the country. The government will be held to account for what it has done. This unelected Prime Minister should now resign. #Lab pic MCGuGZpm— The Labour PartySeptember , The Labour leader targeted the Prime Minister over his controversial Dailycolumn, telling the conference: “When Boris Johnson compared Muslim women to letterboxes or bank robbers, it wasn’t a flippant comment, it was calculated to play on people’s fears.“Displays of racism, Islamophobia or anti-Semitism are not signs of strength, but of weakness.”Mr Corbyn’s party is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission after a series of anti-Semitism scandals.In a pre-election pitch to voters, Mr Corbyn said his party would “bring people together”, healing Brexit ides and tackling inequality.The tide is turning. Together, we’ll take on the privileged, and put the people into power. #Lab pic KXViHUtYX— The Labour PartySeptember , “We stand not just for the % or the % but for the %,” he said.“The Labour government I lead will take on those who really run our country – the financial speculators, tax dodgers and big polluters – so the real wealth creators, the people of this county, can have the jobs, services and futures they deserve.”Labour will use “every mechanism” it can to bring about an early election, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said following the speech, but with the “condition being that we need to ensure that they can’t use that to force a crash-out of the European Union without a deal”.Mr Corbyn is said to be in touch with opposition parties and willto London on Tuesday evening.Labour is not expected to support a recess next week for the Tory Party conference unless Boris Johnson requests an extension to Britain’s EU membership from Brussels.“Every step going forward now has to be conditional on them carrying out the legislation that was passed in Parliament and making it impossible to leave the European Union without a deal on st October,” the spokesman said. In an indication of the Brexit battle lines that will be drawn in the expected election, Tory chairman James Cleverly said: “Jeremy Corbyn’s offer is clear: more pointless delay and a wrecked economy, leaving the country with higher taxes and fewer jobs. He can’t even lead his own party, let alone the country.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “Labour supporters will once again be disappointed that Jeremy Corbyn has failed to show leadership and commit a Labour Government to opposing Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"giant inflatable turtle on display outside parliament for climate strike","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With smaller allied parties, a total of  legislators have thrown their support behind Mr Netanyahu, against  for Mr Gantz, leaving both men short of the required -seat majority.A unity deal between the large parties, with a rotating leadership, is seen as perhaps the only way out of the gridlock. That is what Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, is insisting on.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry trades union council calls public back youth climate strike","story":"Derry Trades Union Council have said they are to stand with the Youth Strike  Climate Derry organisation this Friday fighting for climate justice.DTUC have called on everyone to mobilise on September  and attend the Youth Strike  Climate Rally, Guildhall Square, for pm.Niall McCarroll, Chairman of DTUC said: \"Young people today are both politically and environmentally aware, the young people organising this event are an inspiration and deserve huge credit for this campaign, however, for any campaign to success it needs support and a radical mass mobilization to get behind the campaign objectives.We need to fight for our planets survival but we also need to look at our habits as humans and the damage our le choices and lestyles are creating.\"More than  percent of the Amazon rainforest is already gone, and much more is severely threatened as the destruction continues.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference.

It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development

Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation.

Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/air_1221.jpg","title":"belfast city airport named airport of the year","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business Belfast City Airport has been named ‘airport of the year’ at an international aviation industry event.
