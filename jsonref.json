Donald Trump? Who cared? He was just The Apprentice then,\u0027  photographer Keith Munyan, one of her close friends, said.Trump has always denied having sex with Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. At the time of their alleged encounter, he had been married to the first lady for a year. Last week, his long serving lawyer flipped on him and admitted paying Daniels $130,000 to keep her allegations to herself ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen admitted making a similar arrangement with former playmate Karen McDougal.   \u0027It was just normal person sex,\u0027 Daniels said of her alleged tryst with the president in 2006. Trump (pictured together at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament were they met) denies they ever slept togetherFor months, Trump said he did not know about the payments. In his plea, Cohen claimed the opposite and said he acted under Trump\u0027s instruction. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in doing so, among other criminal charges, and is now facing jail time. Daniels gloated on Twitter after his plea. She later told Vogue: \u0027Michael and I are vindicated, and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong.\u0027 Her in-person interview  was completed months earlier when her fight against the president and his lawyer was still uncertain but others interviewed for it said they all knew about the payment and laughed at Daniels for not taking more money.\u0027We made fun of her because she took so little money,\u0027 Kelli Roberts who worked with Daniels in the porn industry, said. Roberts later said Daniels \u0027stood out\u0027 from others when she was in charge of porn shoots in the 1990s because she would \u0027rent mansions for the day\u0027 and \u0027bring bottled water and doughnuts to make the girls feel comfortable.\u0027 Daniel complained that she was living like a \u0027fugitive\u0027 with paparazzi camped outside her home in Texas if she ever stayed put for long enough. \u0027We’ve been in a couple car chases. We’ve had people put notes under the door, which means they know what hotel I’m in, which means we\u0027ve had to change hotels in the middle of the night,\u0027 she said, referring to herself and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.                             My fan base is completely different. It\u0027s pretty much these packs of women and they\u0027re like, You\u0027re going to save the world.                         \u0027We’ve been at restaurants when we order food and it’s taken too long or somebody was watching and we’ve had to leave—like that. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so skinny,\u0027 she went on. Avenatti was also photographed by Leibowitz for the interview. The pair jokingly referred to themselves as Thelma and Louise at one stage.\u0027Do you want to be Thelma or Louise, Michael?\u0027 she asked.  Avenatti replied: \u0027Who\u0027s driving the car?\u0027 Their exchange went on with Daniels asking, \u0027Yeah, who decided to go off the cliff?\u0027 When the Vogue writer interjected that it had been Thelma, Avenatti carried on: \u0027But was she driving?\u0027 After being told that she wasn\u0027t, he said: \u0027I want to be Louise.\u0027 Daniels, at that, said: \u0027Which one of us gets Brad Pitt?\u0027 Elsewhere, Avenatti described her as \u0027really f****** smart\u0027. After Cohen\u0027s plea last week, he told the magazine in an email: \u0027Trump is in a lot of trouble. His habit of disloyalty and stepping on people is about to catch up to him.\u0027 The interview also happened before Daniels was arrested in Ohio during one of her strip shows. She was accused of inappropriately touching patrons by slapping their faces with her bare breasts. Avenatti fought the charges successfully and they were dropped. Since she began her Make America Horny Again tour of strip clubs, Daniels said she has been faced with an unexpected outpouring of admiration from women who are pinning their hopes for a \u0027revolution\u0027 on her, their unlikely leader. \u0027My fan base is completely different. It’s pretty much these packs of women, and they are angry. People come up and they’re so emotional and they put so much on me. They’re like, You’re going to save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a hero. \u0027When I started this, I just wanted to save my own a**. Not everybody else\u0027s,\u0027 she said.She also touched on her estranged relationship from her mother which had been well documented in previous interviews and said her upbringing was \u0027neglectful\u0027.  \u0027I haven’t talked to my mom in over ten years and I haven’t talked to my dad in 22 years,\u0027 she said, adding that she grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convinced that she had been adopted from a rich family because she felt so out of place with her own relatives.                             She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine                        \u0027My mom lives in a house that has a boat in the front yard that hasn’t seen water since 1982, and she’s content to just sit there and chain-smoke, and I just couldn’t be like that,\u0027 she said. She later said: \u0027I learned all my early life skills from the strippers at that first club I worked.\u0027 After her Ohio arrest, Daniels\u0027 third husband filed for orce and asked for full custody of their seven-year-old daughter. In the Vogue interview, she spoke candidly about her child and how much she knows about her battle with the president. \u0027She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine. \u0027The problem is they keep using the words, porn star, and she doesn’t know what a porn star is, because she doesn’t know what sex is, and I’m not quite ready to have that conversation,\u0027 she said. Her daughter has been with her father over the last several months while she tours the country. The pair have limited contact and Daniels must wait for her to call her because the child gets too upset whenever she gets in touch unexpectedly, she said. \u0027If I contact her, it makes her sad, so I just kind of have to wait until she wants to talk to me,\u0027 she said. She was forced to pull her daughter out of school and hire a private tutor when a man tried to take a photograph of her near campus, she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/20/4F787F0B00000578-0-image-a-18_1535484112290.jpg","title":"Inside Harrys Eton bedroom England flag Lynx photos women portrait mother","story":"    Harry posing at his desk: two bikini-clad women are seen on his wall, as well as a framed black and white portrait of his late mother Princess Diana (far left).

It was an absolute nightmare. Things being thrown at us and being rammed.\u0027My nephew Callum was petrified - it\u0027s his first year on the boats and he was scared for his life. We had to get him in the boathouse to get him under cover and away from the objects being thrown.\u0027But despite safety fears, the boat will return to the area later this week, with Mr Clark insisting: \u0027It won\u0027t stop us. We\u0027ll take a few days off but we\u0027ll go back out there again.\u0027 Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, lashed out at \u0027criminality and high seas piracy\u0027.\u0027At sea there is always the threat that the smallest incident can lead to loss of life and it\u0027s extremely fortunate that no one lost their lives or was seriously hurt,\u0027 he said.\u0027We have emailed French colleagues and pleaded for an end to this messy affair.\u0027Locals in Devon have meanwhile warned that someone could be killed if something is not done to stop the clashes.On Monday, a British fleet of four boats was up against at least 40 from Northern France. Crews claim the French Navy and coastguard stood by before police finally intervened.Theresa May was asked about the issue today and called for those involved to hold talks.She told reporters: \u0027I think it\u0027s important we see an amicable solution to what has happened in the Channel.\u0027It\u0027s what we want and it\u0027s what France wants and we will be working on that.\u0027    Nathan Clark shows the damage done to his ship in the nighttime \u0027battle\u0027 this week          Robert Morley and Kieran McKimmey show some damage done to their ship Golden Promise          British fishermen have accused French trawler crews of smashing up their crab pots in the latest dispute between fishermen on either side of the English ChannelHe told local paper The Newquay Voice: \u0027What they have been doing is towing the crab pots out of the way so they can make room to drag their nets. Three boats in Newquay have been clobbered and a Padstow boat had 150 crab pots dragged away.\u0027There is an understanding that the French fishermen keep away from our crab pots and we stay away from theirs, but they encroach on our pots all the time. It is getting worse year on year.\u0027Fishermen hope that, after Brexit, French boats will not be able to enter a 12-mile limit, potentially solving the issue.                                                    Tensions have run high for at least 15 years, during the so-called \u0027Scallop Wars\u0027. The French want their \u0027Anglo-Saxon\u0027 enemies to stay north of a line from Barfleur to Cap d\u0027Antifer, both in Normandy, and only to use small vessels to avoid running down supplies.But residents in Brixham, where some of the boats caught up in the dispute are based, have backed British fishermen.On a local Facebook discussion, Andrew Elsey wrote: \u0027French pain in a***, I hope they get the book thrown at then as someone will get killed or hurt.\u0027Patricia Shears added: \u0027They have done exactly the same to us in our waters. We watched them cleaning out Torbay many years ago. Could see it all happening from our house.\u0027Some locals called for the Royal Navy to be sent out to protect British boats.Barrie Deas, chief executive of Britain\u0027s National Federation of Fishermen\u0027s Organisations, also urged calm from both sides.          French boats sailed out from Trouville-sur-Mer, Port-en-Bessin and Ouistreham on the North coast of France to meet English scallop boats in the Seine Bay (shown by red marker) – a scallop-rich area off Normandy          One of the British shops involved in the skirmishes was back in dock in Shoreham this morning          Dents were visible in the bow of the Honeybourne 3 this morning following the clashesMr Deas said: \u0027We have raised the matter with the British Government and asked for protection for our vessels, which are fishing legitimately.\u0027The deeper issues behind the clashes should be settled by talking, not on the high seas where people could be hurt.\u0027Normandy fishing chief Dimitri Rogoff said: \u0027The French engaged the British to stop them fishing, they clashed with each other.\u0027He claimed the British were \u0027pillaging\u0027 the multi-million-pound scallop supply crucial to both the French and UK fishing industries. He said: \u0027Stones were thrown but there were no injuries or damage.\u0027The French regulation requires French fishermen not to exploit scallops between May 15 and October 1. The British do not have to respect this regulation.\u0027The UK has no such regulation, although in previous years an agreement has allowed both sides to fish fairly. This year, no such agreement is in place.French blamed in pots dispute | Newquay Voice"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/13/4F7BE75F00000578-6110259-image-a-44_1535547163439.jpg","title":"What Kate Middleton inherited Princess Diana revealed","story":"    Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton with the same ring his father used for his motherWhat does Princess Diana’s will say?Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997, a year after she orced from Prince Charles, the father of her two sons, William and Harry. According to The Balance, Diana’s estate consisted of stocks in addition to her £17 million orce settlement.It also included jewellery, dresses and other personal belongings that were valued at approximately £21 million on the day that she died and netted her heirs £13 million, after taxes. But who did she leave her possessions to?She signed her last will and testament on June 1, 1993, but modified the will with a codicil on February 1, 1996. The will stated that her estate would be left in equal shares in trust to her sons until they became 25, with her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale, to act as co-executors and co-trustees.The codicil changed the trustees from her mother and her personal secretary, Commander Patrick Desmond Christian Jermy Jephson, to her mother and sister.However, it was reported that because her mother and sister did not like the provisions of the will, months after Diana’s death, they were able to distribute her estate differently after obtaining a secret variation order from the High Court of Justice.In addition to £50,000 that was left to her butler, Paul Burrell and ‘chattels’, or ‘personal effects’ which were left to her 17 godchildren, a Discretionary Fund was formed for Prince William, Prince Harry, their spouses, their descendants and charities, selected by the co-trustees.          Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer pose following the announcement of engagementThe Balance reported: ‘The Discretionary Fund received the following assets of the estate: intellectual property rights, all wearing apparel, £100,000, and accumulated income earned by the fund\u0027s assets.‘The Discretionary Fund is to be held for a Perpetuity Period which will last until 21 years after the death of the last surviving descendant of his late Majesty King George VI who was living on the date of Princess Diana\u0027s death.‘King George VI was the father of Queen Elizabeth II, grandfather of Prince Charles, great-grandfather of Prince William and Prince Harry, and the subject of the 2010 movie, The King\u0027s Speech.‘The income earned by the fund is to be distributed among the fund\u0027s beneficiaries during the Perpetuity Period as the trustees see fit. Anything left in the fund when it expires will go to the then living descendants of Prince William and Prince Harry.’What is referred to as the Residuary Estate was left in equal shares to William and Harry and the shares were held in trust until each Prince reached the age of 30. However, when they turned 25, they were given access to all the income and also, the power to change the final disposition of his trust if anything should remain at the time of his death.At the time of each Prince’s 30th birthday, their Residuary Estate shares were worth £10 million each.          Kate Middleton wears engagement ring of Diana, Princess of Wales, as she poses for the mediaWhat Kate Middleton inherited from Princess DianaAccording to The Telegraph, Diana’s Letter of Wishes stated: ‘But I would like you to allocate all my jewelry to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewelry to your discretion.’After Prince William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, she has been repeatedly compared to Princess Diana and has also been spotted wearing her late mother-in-law’s jewellery. As reported in Good Housekeeping, the first piece that was given to Kate was her engagement ring.While rumours emerged that Harry had picked out the ring originally, after seeing William’s love for Kate, he traded the sapphire gem for his mother’s Cartier watch. William carried the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and eventually proposed.When the engagement was announced, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well. It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement.’As mentioned above, Kate has also been seen wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara, which was made in 1914 with diamonds and pearls. It was given to Princess Diana by The Queen as a wedding present and once Kate married into the Royal Family, she inherited the piece.The Duchess of Cambridge also inherited a pair of sapphire earrings from Diana in 2010, but they have since been updated to a drop style. Alongside this, Kate was also seen wearing a pearl bracelet, by Nigel Milne in 1988. While it wasn’t as iconic as the other pieces, the Duchess chose to wear it at a reception in Berlin.          Meghan Markle is seen here wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring which belonged to DianaWhat will Kate inherit from Diana when the Queen dies?Kate Middleton could also reportedly inherit Princess Diana’s title of Princess of Wales when The Queen passes away and Prince Charles becomes King, according to Elle. Prince William will become William, Prince of Wales and Kate, the title of Princess of Wales.The People’s Princess was the last person to hold this title after Camilla, Charles’ second wife declined taking up the title out of respect for her husband’s first wife.National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, August 29Meek Mill and his Dream Chasers team to give 6,000 backpacks to Philadelphia school studentsWhen is the Bachelor in Paradise finale and who gets dumped?Who is Tobias Menzies?

Following attempts to negotiate with the man, a Taser was discharged and the man was detained under the Mental Health Act.\u0027No officers were injured.          Officers were called to the sports centre at 7.53am this morning, following reports of a man exposing himself\u0027The man did not suffer any injuries but he has been taken to hospital as a precaution.\u0027 The suspect is a 34-year old man who had reportedly jumped into the pool and threatened to harm officers and members of the public. All members of the public were evacuated from the pool and no one suffered any injuries.As the commotion continued, Danny John-Jules found himself inadvertently caught up in the situation, as the man locked himself in the centre.The Red Dwarf star was on his way to use the gym just before 11am this morning when he came across the situation, where at least ten police cars had surrounded the sports centre.He tweeted a video, showing the police presence outside the centre and said: \u0027So I just turned up to go to the gym and this is what I was greeted with..\u0027\u0027You know what I mean. What\u0027s going on? So apparently there\u0027s a geezer or someone hold up in the gym and there\u0027s a hostage negotiator being called for.  The Strictly star was caught up in the drama as he attended Willesden Sports Centre for a training session\u0027So welcome to north west London.\u0027The bemused actor went on: \u0027So my Strictly prep has been thwarted by a man who has stripped off in the swimming pool.

I thought I was at Notting Hill Carnival!\u0027However, he has now hit back at newspapers at the scene who he has slammed for \u0027never contacting me for a story about me\u0027.Speaking at the scene he said: \u0027All these newspapers have just used my video without my permission.          No officers were injured during the incident. Police cars took over the majority of the Willesden Sports Centre car park (pictured above)\u0027They\u0027ve never once contacted me for a story about me. But now when it suits them they all want to talk.\u0027The actor was apparently fuming that some papers had unearthed Twitter rants he had made about Strictly in the past.The 57-year-old said: \u0027They\u0027ve dug up things I said about Strictly on Twitter years ago, out of a dustbin, and put it on the front page.   Following the incident the suspect has been taken to hospital and has been detained under the Mental Health Act \u0027Now they\u0027re taking my video about this story about a madman in a swimming pool - don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a bit hypocritical?\u0027Brent Council have issued a statement on Twitter which states that the pool will now be closed for the rest of the day.‘Following an incident earlier today Willesden Sport Centre\u0027s pool remains closed.

The eye of the storm was just 50 miles from their position meaning the duo faced giant waves, rain and thunderstorms and had to lock themselves in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours.In one terrifying incident Steve says he was also swept overboard, saved only by the fact he was tethered to the boat all the time.  Steve Sparkes, left, and Mick Dawson, right, initially expected to complete their trip in around 55 days, but weather delays meant the pair spent more than 80 days at sea          Following the storm, the pair were offered a tow for the remaining few miles into Hawaii, but decided it was important for them to complete their amazing journey greatestThe pair were offered a tow back to the finish line but turned down the offer, wanting to complete what they started under their own steam.Steve, of South Brent, Devon, said that despite all the challenges he was thrilled to be back on dry land and was met with a flask of tea after having no gas to make hot food or drinks for the last few days.          The pair of intrepid rowers celebrated upon their arrival on Hawaii after their 3,000-mile tripHe said: \u0027It feels amazing - I am buzzing right now.\u0027It is great to be back on dry land and I will have such good memories. To be greeted the way we were in Hawaii was just the icing on the cake. There were so many people there and the reaction we got was amazing.\u0027It is just a feeling of relief at having finally conquered the trip.The welcome was fantastic and all the pain just went out the door.\u0027Of course I am very proud to have done it and become the first visually impaired person to.\u0027Hopefully people with similar problems in life, both physical and mental, can look at it and maybe think \u0027I can give it a go.\u0027\u0027The rewards having achieved it far outweigh any downside and has made me feel exceptionally boosted. I am sure that feeling will last a long time.\u0027          Changing currents and adverse weather forced the pair to travel an extra 600 miles           The pair were just 120 miles from safety when they found their path was blocked by a hurricaneWhile the direct route is 2,400 miles, weather conditions and changing currents means Steve and Mick, 54, rowed closer to 3,000 miles.The row has been completely unaided and the pair carried their own food and supplies, as well as equipment for turning seawater into fresh drinking water.During the journey the pair suffered several other setbacks - including breaking two oars in rough conditions.Due to his lack of vision, Steve also slipped on the deck of the boat, nicknamed \u0027Bojangles\u0027, injuring his face and head, and he also suffered a knee injury which made the journey slower.He added: \u0027I make no bones out it - I found it incredibly gruelling from the word go. We didn\u0027t have the best of weather and from day one it was choppy and it just got worse.\u0027It did not go as predicted and we started by looking at 55 days but in the end it took us 82.\u0027There were very rough seas and one turned us over and I ended up in the sea. That was a shock to the system and a real eye opener at what the Pacific can throw at you.\u0027You just never knew what was around the corner. 120 miles out we were blocked by Hurricane Lane which was right on top of us.\u0027That was an horrendous experience.\u0027The whole trip was full of ups and downs but I am just thrilled that we cracked it. I still think \u0027crickey - how did we do it?\u0027Part of me wants to do it again so can enjoy the rowing a bit more in calmer conditions.\u0027The pair took it in turns rowing for two hours and spending two hours resting and coped through bouncing off each other.Steve added: \u0027There are always times when you doubt yourself but you just have to pick each other up. Mick is an accomplished ocean rower and kicked me when I needed to be kicked.\u0027We just bounced off each other to keep us motivated.\u0027Mick added: \u0027It is very easy to lose the will to live out there but there was nothing we could not make a joke about and that was how we coped.\u0027The hurricane was right on top of us. We had an idea where it was due to go and were able to stop early enough but we were still hit by formidable winds.\u0027The worst thing was we were crammed in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours while the storm past over us.\u0027Steve\u0027s blindness is due to a rare form of macular degeneration known as Stargardts. He has lost his sight completely apart from some peripheral vision of shapes and colours.He was medically discharged from the Royal Marines at a time when there was little in the way of support in place for injured veterans.Ten years after his discharge Blind Veterans UK, then known as St Dunstans, tracked down Steve who was by then living in Malta.They flew him back to the UK and provided the first training and support to help Steve deal with his condition. He has since worked consistently with and for Blind Veterans UK helping other veterans come to terms with their loss of sight.The pair are raising money for Blind Veterans UK, and also The Royal Marines Charity for their challenge and their total currently stands at £10,000.The pair are due to fly back to the UK on Saturday and are visiting Pearl Harbour with the US Marines tomorrow (Wednesday).Visit www.cockleshell-pacific.com to make a donation. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/13/4F75F56500000578-0-image-a-91_1535460306854.jpg","title":"Giant European hornet size 2 coin spotted British garden","story":"    One of Europe\u0027s biggest hornets, which is the same size as a £2 coin and delivers a painful sting, has been spotted in the UK - in a garden in Paignton, DevonLouisa Bartlett, head keeper at Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, said: \u0027This is, in fact, a European hornet, which is part of the wasp family.\u0027Although they seem big and scary, they are in fact less likely to sting compared to the common wasp.Creepy X-ray animation reveals how four unknown species of...The parasitic plant that turns wasps into MUMMIES:...Share this article\u0027They can range in size from 2-5cm in length and usually nest in holes in trees.\u0027European hornets are known to feed on large insects but can also strip off bark to from trees to access the sap.\u0027Despite being less likely to sting, the European hornet packs a punch when it does.They tend to sting only when they are stepped on or grabbed, but generally avoid conflict.The sting is said to be very painful and anyone stung by these insects is advised to seek medical attention. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/12/4F7E86E800000578-0-image-m-13_1535542608395.jpg","title":"Return begpackers Western tourist begs money Thai people travel","story":"A Western tourist has sparked anger in Thailand after begging for money from locals working at a marketAccording to the website Coconuts, two unidentified men were sitting next to  signs written in Thai and English.However, it is not clear whether both were begging or one was simply a friend or someone who had just sat down to talk.British cave er\u0027s mother insists her son IS taking legal...Thai police say they will summons British teenager raped on...Share this articleOne sign said: \u0027My name is Alex.

Right: The girls on their 16th birthday          Ready for university: The twins, pictured together on social media, have grown into \u0027fine young women\u0027, says their adoptive motherSpeaking exclusively to MailOnline, Judith said: \u0027If they came to see Alan before he died it would be highly unique, a very nice gesture, but I can\u0027t see it. Though they could if they wanted to.\u0027I\u0027d like them to get in touch with me and Alan, that would be a nice touch, to say thanks for trying to help us, sorry it didn\u0027t work out. It would be some recognition, wouldn\u0027t it, really?\u0027I was prepared to do a lot for them but didn\u0027t get the chance. I was hoping they\u0027d take up law or be a doctor or something like that.\u0027          Alan and Judith Kilshaw are pictured together with Judith\u0027s new husband Stephen Sillett shortly ahead of their marriage in 2009The first time she learned of the twins, Kiara and Keyara Wecker, going to university was when she read about it in the press, she said.\u0027I\u0027m pleased that the girls have gone to university,\u0027 she said. \u0027Obviously I would have preferred them to stay in Britain. At least they\u0027ve come out of it pretty unscathed and they\u0027re doing well.\u0027They\u0027re coping well and seem well-adjusted if they\u0027ve got that far in life. They\u0027d have gone to university if they stayed with us in Britain, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027Missouri-born twins Kiara and Keyara Wecker were just six months old in 2001, when the Kilshaws, of Buckley, North Wales, tried to buy them over the internet for £8,200.The deal was already completed and the twins taken back to Wales when the Kilshaws realized a California couple had already paid to take custody of the kids through an adoption agency  - all thanks to a scam perpetrated by their birth mother.The FBI got involved, sparking an international legal battle that finally ended with the children being raised by a third set of foster parents in Missouri.Now the sisters, who were brought up knowing about their extraordinary story, have turned 18 and are studying social sciences at a university not far from their home in another state after moving. Police are \u0027extremely concerned\u0027 for mother, 41, who walked...Kentucky woman is found guilty of murdering her on-off...Share this articleJudith said that she and Alan still see the twins as part of their family, and still believe that the adoption was wrongly overturned.\u0027Of course we still miss them,\u0027 she said. \u0027As far as I\u0027m concerned, they are still part of this family as the adoption was turned over by dubious means.\u0027If someone takes your name, then the adoption is overturned and the twins are taken away from you by dubious methods, to me that adoption still stands legally.\u0027She added: \u0027The chance to speak to them will come in time. The older they get, the more they will wonder about what went on and sooner or later they might get in touch.\u0027This story brings it all back. I don\u0027t think about them every day any more because life goes on, you have other things to think about.\u0027But at Christmas at times like that, you do then, don\u0027t you. You think about what might have been, but as my mother says, \u0027if\u0027 is a big word.\u0027          In 2000, Kiera and Keyara were first adopted by US couple Richard and Vickie Allen (pictured), who said they had paid £4,000 for the children through an adoption agencyJudith, who starred with Alan in a television programme called At Home With The Kilshaws that provoked public anger, said that the twins would have had a better life with her in Britain.\u0027Our farmhouse would have given them a better life than America in a lot of respects,\u0027 she said.\u0027It\u0027s a safer environment, in my book, and there are still a lot of racial problems out there. The twins are mixed race.\u0027We\u0027d have been just as good parents as the new foster parents.\u0027          The Kilshaws, who maintained they were unaware that the twins had already been through two sets of parents, had been dealing with Internet adoption broker Tina JohnsonShe has struggled to move on with her life, she said. \u0027I haven\u0027t made a shrine to them or anything. I don\u0027t go in for that. I keep my thoughts in my head. But if I met them, I\u0027d say I\u0027m pleased they\u0027ve done well.\u0027I\u0027m pleased they\u0027ve gone to university. I hope they do well and study well.\u0027They\u0027re going to the same university, so they must be close. I\u0027m pleased with how their life has gone up to know.\u0027Asked whether she or Alan would pay for the twins to visit them in Britain, Judith said: \u0027I don\u0027t know how their finances are. I can\u0027t pay for them. I\u0027m struggling myself and Alan hasn\u0027t earned any money since he\u0027s been in hospital.\u0027 In 2009, Judith, then 55, left Alan and her two sons and married ‘toyboy lover’ Stephen Sillett, 42, who she met in a nightclub.At the wedding, Alan gave his ex-wife away to Stephen and wished them well.\u0027It\u0027s a bit unusual, but there are probably quite a lot of husbands who\u0027d like to give away their ex-wives, so perhaps I\u0027ll start a trend,\u0027 said Alan at the time.Judith and Stephen are still together.           Alan and Judith Kilshaw speak to reporters outside their farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales shortly after the twins were taken out of their custody"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/06/4F7BBF8000000578-6108937-image-a-1_1535521870415.jpg","title":"US Open officials express regret Alize Cornets code violation","story":"    Walkback: US Open released this statement Wednesday expressing regret over the matter of Alize Cornet\u0027s shirt change was handled the day before              US Open officials have come under fire for reprimanding a female tennis player for taking her shirt off on court Wednesday          French tennis player Alize Cornet (pictured) returned from a heat break when she realized her sports top was on backwards          Cornet exposed her black sports bra during the quick change, which lasted about 10 seconds          The Women\u0027s Tennis Association said the code violation handed to Cornet was unfair\u0027All players can change their shirts when sitting in the player chair.

Perverts are known to use online games and mobile phone apps to target youngsters.One girl, aged nine, said: ‘A complete stranger asked me to take my clothes off and send him a picture... When I deleted the game, I went on another site and the same person asked me to have sex with him. I told him to “back off” and then deleted that game.’EXCLUSIVE: Jacksonville gunman had 26 police callouts to his...Kentucky woman found guilty of murdering her on-off...Share this articleShe later came across the same predator on several sites.But, in an example of an increasingly sexualised society, even at primary school age some youngsters admitted to sharing naked or semi-nude images with classmates. When asked why, the youngsters told investigators: ‘Because everyone does.’Children polled by the NSPCC were asked whether an adult had ever sent or shown them a naked or semi-naked picture or video on an app, website or game.Of the 21,648 primary school children questioned, 791 answered yes – a ratio of one in 27. A further 959 secondary school pupils out of 18,186 questioned also said it happened to them – around one in 19.          One in 50 children still at school has sent an adult a nude image of themselves, research by the charity has foundPrevious police statistics, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have revealed that games such as Minecraft and Words With Friends – an app similar to Scrabble – had both been used for grooming.Parents have also spoken out about predators trying to lure their children into carrying out explicit acts through the chat function on video game Fortnite.As well as strangers using online platforms to groom children, young people have also told of how they had received images from adults they know. One boy aged between 14 and 15 said: ‘My coach sent me a video of Santa stripping naked.’Earlier this year, Freedom of Information requests by the NSPCC revealed there had been more than 3,000 offences recorded last year in England and Wales where offenders had been accused of sexual communication with a child. The charity has set up a petition calling on the Government to put an end to the ‘Wild West Web’. It wants an independent regulator and a mandatory code of conduct for web firms.The NSPCC’s associate head of child safety online, Andy Burrows, said predators used ‘phishing’ techniques in which they targeted a ‘significant amount’ of children.‘It is similar to phishing emails,’ he said. ‘It is with the intention of starting a large number of conversations in the hope they will strike up contact with a small number.’Mr Burrows said a ‘tell-tale’ indicator of a predator using a site to contact children was one person sending hundreds of friend requests – with only a few people accepting. He added that websites could spot such a tactic with a ‘very simple analysis’. ‘Right now children do not have the protection that they need,’ he said.Mr Wanless said: ‘Grooming can no longer be shrugged off as secondary to other online crimes. It is happening to very young children, it is happening so frequently that it’s becoming normalised.‘Social networks have become a gateway for child abuse. We need tough regulation of social networks to make sure there are fundamental protections for children in place whatever sites they’re using.’A spokesman for Microsoft, which owns Minecraft, said keeping children safer online was a priority and it provided parental controls for devices."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/21/4F511D1700000578-0-image-m-4_1535575053990.jpg","title":"National Lottery results Lotto numbers Wednesday August 29","story":"Winning numbers for Friday, August 24The winning lotto numbers for Friday, August 24 are 33, 56, 9, 39, 41 and 22 with 48 as the bonus ball.National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, August 29Meek Mill and his Dream Chasers team to give 6,000 backpacks to Philadelphia school studentsWhen is the Bachelor in Paradise finale and who gets dumped?Who is Tobias Menzies?

ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014Its cross-border state now destroyed, ISIS is instead likely to focus on spreading shock and terror around the world through dramatic attacks, the official added. ISIS will have to find \u0027a new way of doing things, especially to recruit after heavy losses\u0027, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP. At its peak, the self-proclaimed caliphate included 35 \u0027wilaya\u0027 (provinces) mostly set within a swathe of territory ning either side of the border between Syria and Iraq.But following major military defeats - including the jihadists\u0027 loss of their de facto capitals of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq - ISIS propaganda outlets now only mention six \u0027wilaya\u0027.Former ISIS provinces like Mosul, Raqqa and Kirkuk - an oil-rich province in Iraq - no longer exist.Instead, the term \u0027wilaya\u0027 is now used to refer to large chunks of territory like Iraq and Syria, along with Somalia, East Asia, Tajikistan and the Egyptian Sinai.The administrative reshuffle marks a clear switch from 2014, when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi boasted of having erased the \u0027imperialist\u0027 design that ided the Middle East.The proclamation was made with great fanfare as jihadists drove bulldozers across the Syrian-Iraqi border, symbolically destroying one of the frontiers drawn up by colonial powers as they carved out the modern Middle East from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.After years battling ISIS, Iraqi troops are now redeployed along most of the border with Syria, across which jihadists and weapons have long flowed unimpeded.On the Syrian side, separate offensives by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a US-backed coalition have pushed ISIS jihadists out of most of the territory they once controlled.\u0027The change proves Daesh\u0027s weakness and the loss of much of its leadership,\u0027 the security official told AFP, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS.ISIS\u0027s restructure \u0027shows its central command lacks confidence in its wilaya commanders in Iraq and that it is reducing their powers to one (central) leadership\u0027, the official said.Iraqi authorities regularly announce the arrest or death of ISIS leaders and relatives of Baghdadi, such as his son, who was killed in Syria in July by Russian missiles.Baghdadi himself was thought to have been killed several times, and the US has offered up a $25 million (21.5 million euro) reward for information leading to his capture or death.    The jihadist group has been pinned down to its last desert holdouts in Syria having lost all urban centres previously under its control in neighbouring IraqIn a purported new audio message released on Wednesday to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, Baghdadi called on his followers to \u0027not give up the jihad against their enemy\u0027.\u0027Baghdadi\u0027s speech was one of consolation and condolence,\u0027 said Hisham al-Hashemi, an expert on radical Islamist groups.It was an \u0027acknowledgement of defeat... but (Baghdadi) urged those remaining to persevere\u0027, he said.In a first, Baghdadi used his 55-minute recording to call for attacks in the West, saying an operation there would be \u0027worth a thousand\u0027 at home.Much of the address was reminiscent of approaches long used by Al-Qaeda, according to Hashemi.In it, the ISIS leader scorns the US, blasts Shiite Iran, and calls on Sunni Muslims in Iraq to denounce the Shiite-dominated paramilitary units of the Hashed al-Shaabi.Tore Hamming, a jihadist specialist at the European University Institute, said Baghdadi\u0027s speech falls into the same category as his last three - \u0027crisis management\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/13/4F74DE0900000578-0-image-m-20_1535460017865.jpg","title":"Pro EU Tories reveal huge surge local party membership","story":"Share this articleTories fear infiltration by Ukip members | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/09/4F7CC22200000578-6109337-image-a-40_1535531832274.jpg","title":"Up 200 motorists given beds night IKEA STORE","story":"    Fergal Parkinson hailed the store for allowing his wife and daughter to stay overnight          Hilarious posts on social media show one tired motorist lying face down on a model IKEA bed          IKEA\u0027s gesture was praised online, as some people tried to look at the positives of the situationIKEA\u0027s generous gesture to offer those stranded on the nearby motorway was praised on social media.Fergal Parkinson hailed the store for allowing his wife and daughter to stay overnight.He told BBC News around 200 people were offered beds for the night.In a photograph of the two cuddled in bed together, he wrote: \u0027Good on @ IKEAUK letting people, including my wife and daughter, stay in their bedrooms overnight after the M25 accident.\u0027Another person called Natasha shared a photograph of herself and another person laying in an IKEA bed with the caption: \u0027Glad to finally have our room. @IKEAUK.\u0027Kroger to phase out plastic bags at all grocery stores...Share this articleShe later added they were in the store until 9.30pm before they were finally able to get back onto the road.Dame Kelly Holmes was among those caught in the gridlocked traffic as she confessed  she had to go to the toilet on the roadside. The Olympic champion said: \u0027Sorry but I had to go!

The eye of the storm was just 50 miles from their position meaning the duo faced giant waves, rain and thunderstorms and had to lock themselves in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours.In one terrifying incident Steve says he was also swept overboard, saved only by the fact he was tethered to the boat all the time.  Steve Sparkes, left, and Mick Dawson, right, initially expected to complete their trip in around 55 days, but weather delays meant the pair spent more than 80 days at sea          Following the storm, the pair were offered a tow for the remaining few miles into Hawaii, but decided it was important for them to complete their amazing journey greatestThe pair were offered a tow back to the finish line but turned down the offer, wanting to complete what they started under their own steam.Steve, of South Brent, Devon, said that despite all the challenges he was thrilled to be back on dry land and was met with a flask of tea after having no gas to make hot food or drinks for the last few days.          The pair of intrepid rowers celebrated upon their arrival on Hawaii after their 3,000-mile tripHe said: \u0027It feels amazing - I am buzzing right now.\u0027It is great to be back on dry land and I will have such good memories. To be greeted the way we were in Hawaii was just the icing on the cake. There were so many people there and the reaction we got was amazing.\u0027It is just a feeling of relief at having finally conquered the trip.The welcome was fantastic and all the pain just went out the door.\u0027Of course I am very proud to have done it and become the first visually impaired person to.\u0027Hopefully people with similar problems in life, both physical and mental, can look at it and maybe think \u0027I can give it a go.\u0027\u0027The rewards having achieved it far outweigh any downside and has made me feel exceptionally boosted. I am sure that feeling will last a long time.\u0027          Changing currents and adverse weather forced the pair to travel an extra 600 miles           The pair were just 120 miles from safety when they found their path was blocked by a hurricaneWhile the direct route is 2,400 miles, weather conditions and changing currents means Steve and Mick, 54, rowed closer to 3,000 miles.The row has been completely unaided and the pair carried their own food and supplies, as well as equipment for turning seawater into fresh drinking water.During the journey the pair suffered several other setbacks - including breaking two oars in rough conditions.Due to his lack of vision, Steve also slipped on the deck of the boat, nicknamed \u0027Bojangles\u0027, injuring his face and head, and he also suffered a knee injury which made the journey slower.He added: \u0027I make no bones out it - I found it incredibly gruelling from the word go. We didn\u0027t have the best of weather and from day one it was choppy and it just got worse.\u0027It did not go as predicted and we started by looking at 55 days but in the end it took us 82.\u0027There were very rough seas and one turned us over and I ended up in the sea. That was a shock to the system and a real eye opener at what the Pacific can throw at you.\u0027You just never knew what was around the corner. 120 miles out we were blocked by Hurricane Lane which was right on top of us.\u0027That was an horrendous experience.\u0027The whole trip was full of ups and downs but I am just thrilled that we cracked it. I still think \u0027crickey - how did we do it?\u0027Part of me wants to do it again so can enjoy the rowing a bit more in calmer conditions.\u0027The pair took it in turns rowing for two hours and spending two hours resting and coped through bouncing off each other.Steve added: \u0027There are always times when you doubt yourself but you just have to pick each other up. Mick is an accomplished ocean rower and kicked me when I needed to be kicked.\u0027We just bounced off each other to keep us motivated.\u0027Mick added: \u0027It is very easy to lose the will to live out there but there was nothing we could not make a joke about and that was how we coped.\u0027The hurricane was right on top of us. We had an idea where it was due to go and were able to stop early enough but we were still hit by formidable winds.\u0027The worst thing was we were crammed in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours while the storm past over us.\u0027Steve\u0027s blindness is due to a rare form of macular degeneration known as Stargardts. He has lost his sight completely apart from some peripheral vision of shapes and colours.He was medically discharged from the Royal Marines at a time when there was little in the way of support in place for injured veterans.Ten years after his discharge Blind Veterans UK, then known as St Dunstans, tracked down Steve who was by then living in Malta.They flew him back to the UK and provided the first training and support to help Steve deal with his condition. He has since worked consistently with and for Blind Veterans UK helping other veterans come to terms with their loss of sight.The pair are raising money for Blind Veterans UK, and also The Royal Marines Charity for their challenge and their total currently stands at £10,000.The pair are due to fly back to the UK on Saturday and are visiting Pearl Harbour with the US Marines tomorrow (Wednesday).Visit www.cockleshell-pacific.com to make a donation. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/14/4F7F0F6C00000578-0-image-m-69_1535550918932.jpg","title":"I no choice Asia Argentos model friend speaks leaking texts","story":"Share this articleRose McGowan distances herself from Asia Argento in new statementAsia Argento and 17-Year-Old Boy in Bed in Sexual Encounter | TMZ.com"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/08/4F75816B00000578-0-image-m-7_1535529536244.jpg","title":"British artist 50 accused walking luxury hotel without paying","story":"    Mother-of-four Larissa Watson was accused of stealing a £130,000 luxury motorboat in June after deserting her family back home in Britain and launching a months-long crime spree across Italy           The room Mrs Watson booked, using her own name, was one of 45 offered by the Irish Cultural Centre in Paris in its historic 18th building in the heart of the Latin QuarterThe room Mrs Watson booked, using her own name, was one of 45 offered by the Irish Cultural Centre in Paris in its historic 18th building in the heart of the Latin Quarter.Magic Johnson, 59, enjoys birthday festivities on a...Maradona claims his ex-wife misappropriated $9 million of...Share this articleIt cost just 90 euros a night - far less than the luxury hotels in Italy where she allegedly stayed without paying, which led to fraud charges being laid against her there.

Perverts are known to use online games and mobile phone apps to target youngsters.One girl, aged nine, said: ‘A complete stranger asked me to take my clothes off and send him a picture... When I deleted the game, I went on another site and the same person asked me to have sex with him. I told him to “back off” and then deleted that game.’EXCLUSIVE: Jacksonville gunman had 26 police callouts to his...Kentucky woman found guilty of murdering her on-off...Share this articleShe later came across the same predator on several sites.But, in an example of an increasingly sexualised society, even at primary school age some youngsters admitted to sharing naked or semi-nude images with classmates. When asked why, the youngsters told investigators: ‘Because everyone does.’Children polled by the NSPCC were asked whether an adult had ever sent or shown them a naked or semi-naked picture or video on an app, website or game.Of the 21,648 primary school children questioned, 791 answered yes – a ratio of one in 27. A further 959 secondary school pupils out of 18,186 questioned also said it happened to them – around one in 19.          One in 50 children still at school has sent an adult a nude image of themselves, research by the charity has foundPrevious police statistics, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have revealed that games such as Minecraft and Words With Friends – an app similar to Scrabble – had both been used for grooming.Parents have also spoken out about predators trying to lure their children into carrying out explicit acts through the chat function on video game Fortnite.As well as strangers using online platforms to groom children, young people have also told of how they had received images from adults they know. One boy aged between 14 and 15 said: ‘My coach sent me a video of Santa stripping naked.’Earlier this year, Freedom of Information requests by the NSPCC revealed there had been more than 3,000 offences recorded last year in England and Wales where offenders had been accused of sexual communication with a child. The charity has set up a petition calling on the Government to put an end to the ‘Wild West Web’. It wants an independent regulator and a mandatory code of conduct for web firms.The NSPCC’s associate head of child safety online, Andy Burrows, said predators used ‘phishing’ techniques in which they targeted a ‘significant amount’ of children.‘It is similar to phishing emails,’ he said. ‘It is with the intention of starting a large number of conversations in the hope they will strike up contact with a small number.’Mr Burrows said a ‘tell-tale’ indicator of a predator using a site to contact children was one person sending hundreds of friend requests – with only a few people accepting. He added that websites could spot such a tactic with a ‘very simple analysis’. ‘Right now children do not have the protection that they need,’ he said.Mr Wanless said: ‘Grooming can no longer be shrugged off as secondary to other online crimes. It is happening to very young children, it is happening so frequently that it’s becoming normalised.‘Social networks have become a gateway for child abuse. We need tough regulation of social networks to make sure there are fundamental protections for children in place whatever sites they’re using.’A spokesman for Microsoft, which owns Minecraft, said keeping children safer online was a priority and it provided parental controls for devices."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/22/4F822D7200000578-0-image-m-22_1535579028602.jpg","title":"Parents left baffled builders forget remove lamp post","story":"    Bungling builders who built a new road in Surrey have left residents scratching their heads after seemingly forgetting to remove a lamp post in the middle of the tarmacMore confusingly road markings have been painted beside - even on - the stranded post. The school, at the site of the old law courts, is due to open in September and welcome 60 reception pupils. Managed by the Everychild Trust, the \u0027forest school\u0027 is planning to focus on outdoor learning and a return to activities such as tree climbing and campfire building. \u0027When I heard, I was like holy s***\u0027: Tenants who moved into...Large plumes of smoke fill the air as a Melbourne factory is...Share this articleResidents are bemused after spotting the apparent error at the new Hatchlands primary school site in Redhill, Surrey.

He also worked as a war artist recording the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp immediately after its liberation, and the Nuremberg trials.In 1957 he was a fashionable figure, having recording the Queen’s coronation procession in a huge panorama, and would be commissioned by Prince Philip to produce a mural of the scenes at Buckingham Palace.The bank commissioned Topolski to record its enormous new banknote printworks, opened the previous year at Debden in Essex – and still in use. The vast building, a single tunnel-like arched hall almost three football pitches in length, where paper came in one end and emerged as banknotes at the other, was designed by structural engineer Ove Arup with the architect Sir Howard Robertson.Adam pointed out that Robertson’s architectural style was very familiar to Topolski, as his Shell Centre was rising to tower over the artist’s studio in a railway arch beside the Festival Hall on London’s South Bank. His studio survives as an education foundation, but nearby until recently a Heritage Lottery-backed exhibition in two more arches displayed the maze of panels of the Topolski Century, his eclectic selection of highlights of most of the 20th century: the gallery failed as a visitor attraction but is now a bar displaying some of the panels.In 1957 Topolski spent days at Debden, sketching every aspect of the production process, including the watchers who stared down on the work from behind the darkened glass of a viewing gallery running the length of the building. In the final section of the works women sat all day checking each inidual note for minute printing flaws – the exhibition will include an album of the barely visible faults they detected, working to a quota of 15,000 notes each per shift. Topolski captured not just the giant machines and the painstaking work but the human details, an aching back being stretched, a forkful of dinner halfway to an open mouth, one elegant high-heeled shoe half slipped off for comfort under a table.When the four paintings were finished, the bank realised it probably should not leave the 27 detailed preparatory drawings of the top security works at large in the world, so they bought all of those too.“They really weren’t very well received at all,” Adam said. “I think the workers were a bit shocked that he had got them in such informal moments. But generations of people from the same families have now worked at Debden – there will be people’s grandparents captured in these drawings, who would never otherwise have found a way into our collection. I absolutely love them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc9958e4947f2c250a1ef4458c60ec93e774b5c/0_0_2184_3370/master/2184.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2049d71af7c8ad483057b1e6867d4685 720w","title":"top 10 cliques in fiction","story":"From the droogs in A Clockwork Orange to Donna Tartt’s murderous classicists in The Secret History, these intense friendships often involve bullying, rivalry and obsession“Clique”: a small, close-knit group of people who do not readily allow others to join them. Pack. Set. Gang. As most people who have survived the battlegrounds of childhood can attest, cliques can be summed up in brutal monosyllables: InOut. UsThem.Yet do cliques deserve all the negative press? Some of the greatest literary movements were spurred by collective energy. The Algonquin Round Table traded bons mots over daily lunches. The Lost Generation migrated in flocks. The Bloomsbury group shunned bourgeois values. The Beats met at Columbia, the Inklings at Oxford. These were cliques, but they were also catalysts for creativity.Exploring what makes such collectives tick has been crucial to my debut novel. Swan Song examines the close bonds Truman Capote shared with the mid-20th century’s powerful elite – the women he called his Swans. Having infiltrated their dazzling sphere, Capote would ultimately commit an unforgivable crime: publishing their secrets in extracts from his never-finished roman à clef Answered Prayers. By nature of their status and long-standing friendships, the Swans were the ultimate clique. They allowed Capote entry, but when he transgressed, they bit back, and he was out. To punish him for his betrayal, they used the clique’s most damaging weapon: exclusion.Here are my Top 10 cliques in fiction, ning ages, genders and eras.1. The Secret History by Donna TarttFor me, Tartt’s alluring set of scholars reigns as the ideal literary clique, the one I’d have relished joining at age 18 (messy murder factor aside). Outsider Richard Papen is drawn to the striking quintet he observes on campus: Henry Winter, alpha-classicist, English suits and steely reserve Francis Abernathy, angular and elegant, “a cross between a student Prince and Jack the Ripper” “relentlessly cheery” Bunny Corcoran twins Charles and Camilla Macaulay, pale romantic visions, “like long-dead celebrants from some forgotten garden party”. Richard is eager to join their rarified circle, devoted to mentor Julian’s creed of Hellenic beauty. So great is his desire to join, Richard allows himself to commit murder alongside them. This clique’s deterioration in the wake of their collective decision is what gives the novel its potency.2. Cat’s Eye by Margaret AtwoodAsked what Cat’s Eye was about, Margaret Atwood said: “Little girls are not made of sugar and spice … Even in books for little girls, you usually have the best friend and the worst enemy. In real life these are often the same person.” Returning to Toronto for a retrospective of her paintings, adult Elaine Risley confronts memories of her childhood adversary, Cordelia. She remembers when Cordelia usurped her best friends Grace and Carol, irrevocably altering their group dynamic. The three bullied Elaine, abuse escalating to physical jeopardy. In adolescence, Elaine re-establishes contact with Cordelia, taunting her former tormenter. The novel moves between past and present, where Elaine still bears the scars.3. Deadkidsongs by Toby LittIf Cat’s Eye addresses the devastation wreaked by girls, Deadkidsongs speaks to the terrifying potential of the boys’ clique. Andrew, Matthew, Paul and Peter form “Gang” and occupy their days playing elaborate games of “War”. They assess and mimic the adults around them, admiring the abusive masculinity of “The Best Father”, scorning another’s ineffectual pacifism. Litt mines the dark mindset of the young male clique. 4. The Group by Mary McCarthyCountless books chart college cliques’ transition from idyllic campus life to adulthood, fuelled by ambition and uncertainty. Each owes a debt to the mid-century novel that spawned the genre: 1954’s The Group, which follows eight Vassar graduates. McCarthy’s bestseller shattered female taboos, discussing work, sex, marriage and motherhood with unprecedented frankness. Complex truths of chosen sisterhoods are laid bare their joys, frustrations, rivalries and their inescapable presence in one another’s lives. 5. The Clique: A Novel of the Sixties by Ferdinand MountWritten in 1978, republished in 2010, The Clique follows rookie reporter Gunn Goater, who arrives in London from the provinces, eager to cover the impending demise of Winston Churchill. Waiting outside his subject’s residence, he spies a “little crowd” of five, theatrically dressed, epitomising the Swinging 60s that eluded him in Lincolnshire. The Clique is a sharp work of postwar, pre-Thatcher satire, set against crumbling communal flats and love-ins – a milieu to which Gunn is wholly unsuited. 6. The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey EugenidesEugenides presents the reader with two distinct groups – the collective voice of the narrators, a group of teenage boys in suburban Detroit, and the objects of their obsessive fascination: the beautiful, doomed Lisbon sisters, whose tragic fate is revealed in the opening line. The Lisbons are the most enduring example of the familial clique. They are connected not only by blood, but by increasing isolation from their peers, voiceless victims of an overprotective, evangelical Catholic mother. The boys observe from afar, haunted by their memories even in middle age. It’s their shared requiem that lingers. 7. A Clockwork Orange by Anthony BurgessA vastly different vision of the male teenage clique, this is a dystopian nightmare of young men linked by brutality. Alex and his gang of “droogs” imbibe drug-laced “Knifey Moloko”, preparing for a night of sociopathic violence. They rob, rape and kill in a series of horrific crimes. There’s a hierarchy within the group, which gives way to tensions, in-fighting and challenges for dominance. Alex is betrayed, leading to his incarceration and “aversion therapy”. The clique is defined by callous detachment, desire for power and violence-as-pornography. It raises chilling questions about gang mentality and free will.8. The Parasites by Daphne du MaurierA variation on the clique-as-kin scenario. The Delaneys are a blended family: step-siblings Maria, Niall and Celia, raised by theatrical parents. Narrated by one of the three (which one is cleverly left to conjecture), this is the story of their insular group – a circle closed to friends, husbands and lovers alike. In fact, Maria and Niall share an incestuous romantic bond. Maria’s husband says: “You prey on each other, living in a world of fantasy.” Of themselves, the Delaneys concede: “We have earned, not always fairly we consider, the reputation of being difficult guests.”9. The Girls by Emma ClineCults hold morbid fascination – none more so than the Manson “family”. Cline focuses on its female followers, as idealised through the eyes of 14-year old Evie Boyd. When Evie spots them in a Petaluma park in the summer of 1969, she is mesmerised: “The day was disturbed by the path the girls cut across the regular world. Sleek and thoughtless as sharks breaching the water.” She’s drawn ever deeper into the group, led by the charismatic, Manson-esque “Russell”. Here is the clique as elective family. 10. The Sun Also Rises by Ernest HemingwayLike Answered Prayers, this is a roman a clef, its characters drawn from Hemingway’s Lost Generation expatriate clique. Jake Barnes, a journalist rendered impotent by a war wound, is in Paris, locked in a doomed romance with English orcee Lady Brett Ashley. Their flock migrates from Parisian cafe society to the corridas of Pamplona, where sexual entanglements ide the disillusioned clique. As with Capote’s story, readers were aflutter to unmask the real-life cast. But The Sun Also Rises cemented Hemingway’s reputation while Answered Prayers destroyed Capote’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a785d06662874f29a6410f11c7614644a8a9b4/237_555_3070_1842/master/3070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b90820afdf087199f23582426bbf480","title":"ban sale energy drinks to children uk government combat obesity","story":"Move follows health concerns about heavily caffeinated and sugared drinks Ministers will ban the sale of Red Bull, Monster Energy and other energy drinks to children in England amid growing concern about the impact that the high-caffeine, high-sugar drinks are having on young people’s health.A consultation on how to implement the proposed ban will be unveiled on Thursday, with Downing Street indicating that the principal question to be determined is whether the purchasing restrictions will apply at the age of 16 or 18.Theresa May said the consultation was linked to the government’s childhood obesity strategy and said it was necessary to examine the consumption of energy drinks “often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks”.If you’re a parent, what have been your concerns with your children and energy drinks?

We will consider some of your responses in our ongoing coverage. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere. The principal justification for the ban is the high level of caffeine in the energy drinks, which has been linked to a string of health problems for children, including head and stomach aches, as well as hyperactivity and sleep problems.A 250ml can of Red Bull contains about 80mg of caffeine, roughly the same as a similarly sized cup of coffee, but three times the level of Coca-Cola. Monster Energy, which is often sold in larger cans of 500ml, contains 160mg of caffeine.Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef and food health campaigner, said he welcomed the prospect of a ban on energy drink sales because “too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast” and “teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted because of these drinks, packed with stimulants”.Two-thirds of children aged 10 to 17 and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consume energy drinks, according to the government announcement.Steve Brine, the public health minister, complained that “in some outlets it is possible to buy four 250ml cans of energy drink for £1”. The 12-week consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks that contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre.A Downing Street source added that introducing a ban was all but certain, saying: “It’s a question not of whether we do it, but how.”The move is the latest step in an increasingly interventionist approach being pursued by the Conservatives in relation to childhood obesity and health. When he was the chancellor, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks.Drink brands such as Red Bull, Relentless, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become increasingly popular. Children and teenagers drink them more than adults, even though industry labelling guidelines state that any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about its content and state that it is not recommended for children.The compulsory health warnings read: “High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women or persons sensitive to caffeine.”Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people. That’s why we’re pleased to see the government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children’s health.”The proposed ban only applies to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can all follow suit if their administrations wish. In March, several major supermarket chains announced that they would ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16.The teachers’ union NASUWT called last year for the sale of the drinks to under-16s to be banned by all retailers. Its national official for education, Darren Northcott, described the beverages as “legal highs” that helped to fuel bad behaviour in schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4be07cbb493b5feeddc496c5ab58cae13c4054a/0_308_4697_2817/master/4697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2807165d3d0ddf5232401f14e2ebc614","title":"water companies criticised amount lost from leaks rises for second year","story":"Firms must lead by example if they want customers to conserve supplies, says consumer councilWater firms have been criticised by the industry watchdog after it found the amount of water lost to leakages had increased for the second consecutive year.“We know that consumers are more likely to use water wisely if they can see their water company is doing the same by tackling leaks,” said Karen Gibbs, the consumer group’s senior policy manager.“Water companies must take action to reduce leakage and improve the resilience of their networks if they want to encourage consumers to commit to using water wisely themselves.“Although companies do have plans to reduce leakage in 2020-25, their customers will expect to see this happening now.”CCWater said Thames lost the most through leakage on a per property, per day basis – 181.6 litres. In June, the firm was ordered to pay back £65m to customers over its failure to tackle the leaks. It was also hit with £55m in automatic penalties for failing to fulfil its promise to do so.The best performers were Southern and Essex \u0026amp Suffolk, which reported losing 79.6 and 81.2 litres per property, per day in 2017-18.CCWater is an independent statutory body that is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and represents consumers in England and Wales.A spokesman for the regulator, Ofwat, said: “These figures are further evidence that we need a game change across the water sector.“We’ve thrown down the gauntlet for water companies to cut leakage by 170bn litres a year – enough to meet the needs of everyone in Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff combined – 3.1 million people.“As we have demonstrated recently, any company which isn’t getting to grips with leakages will face consequences.”Water UK, which represents the firms, did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/679fbd1f9ba4c7c1913a7f0c897f8030d5982c81/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c801fd3e5199b174aca2ba4c0c7fe3f","title":"flint michigan story modern american city photo essay zackary canepari","story":"Photographer Zackary Canepari arrived in Flint in 2012, before a scandal about tainted water brought the city to international attention. For six years he has documented a place of struggle, and strengthFlint is a city long infamous for poverty, crime, and more recently the water crisis that has plagued people here for four years. It seems everyone in America knows what to expect when they hear the name Flint: economic, political and social dysfunction. Flint is a place of struggle, but that’s not all it is.For the last six years I’ve been working in Michigan on the Flint is a Place project. It’s an immersive e into a city that is more layered and nuanced than commonly portrayed, telling the story of a community living on the fringes. After 40 years of economic struggle, Flint is a place where the abnormal has become normal.In the 1980s, Flint had the highest median income for under-35s in America. Today it has one of the lowest. The city has consistently been on the FBI’s top 10 most violent list and has the highest ratio of abandoned homes in the country. Over four decades it went from living the American dream to an American nightmare.The water crisis continues, and Flint just shut one of its last remaining high schools. Things have not got better, but there are still people fighting for change.As the water crisis was unfolding, these police cadets were being trained to deal with civil unrest at the Mott Police Academy. The Flint Police Department is barely holding it together. A decade of budget cuts has decreased their number from nearly 300 to fewer than 100 officers as crime continued to increase in a city of 100,000. It’s the lowest ratio of officer to citizen of any comparable city in America.The officers are disgruntled. They feel overwhelmed and under-appreciated. The veterans, many of whom are from Flint, have endured numerous pay cuts and layoffs and have watched their city decay. The younger officers, who haven’t been around long enough to feel loyalty to the city, are leaving to join other departments that pay better and include a real pension.Officer Bridgette Balasko was eating breakfast and watching the post-presidential election coverage before heading to work in 2016. “I didn’t know who I wanted to vote for. I didn’t want to vote,” she told me. “I didn’t want to vote for either candidate because I thought they were both terrible.”These people were handcuffed after police raided a house of drug users. The raid was performed by the crime area target team (Catt), a “zero-tolerance” unit created to focus on drugs and guns in Flint. The raid didn’t yield much – a handful of drug users but not much product. This particular house has been raided multiple times by the police, but they’re unable to evict the owners.In 2014, the city started drawing its drinking water supply from the Flint river, without using lead corrosion controls. Despite public outcry, city officials insisted the water was safe to drink. It wasn’t, and a public health crisis ensued. By 2015, the water crisis became national news.One-year-old Hazel Eilber was being given a bath by her grandmother, Sabrina. She would only bathe Hazel in bottled water because she feared that even touching the tap water could make her sick. Sabrina has since moved out of Flint, vowing never to return.On election day in 2016, friends and family came to pay respects to Montel Kenyatta Wright, 46, who had been killed in a drug deal two weeks earlier. Wright was one of three homicides in Flint that weekend.During the summer, Bluebell Beach is full of families and people having barbecues, but it is also well known for fights and violence. Over the last few years the parks department has made it more family-friendly by increasing security and police patrols, extending the play area and installing a big fountain for kids to play in. The crime and related problems have decreased, and there are now more families around. Locals participate in an environmental rally and sermon at the First Trinity Missionary Baptist Church with Flint mayor Karen Weaver, Russell Simmons (co-founder of hip hop music label Def Jam) and a number of national pastors. Simmons is one of a number of high-profile celebrities who have visited Flint since the water crisis became national news.This was the last football game played at Northwestern High School before the school merged its athletics programme with Southwestern, the only other high school in Flint. Both schools have had an ongoing problem with low enrolment numbers and poor facilities. The schools hope that joining forces will help to tackle the issue. These graduating seniors are affected by generational poverty and a lack of resources. The city has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The students from Northwestern are proud and strong, but they undeniably also have the odds stacked against them.I’d been working with the police department for months and scenes like this were fairly typical. The Catt squad was investigating a call about drugs being sold on this block. In this case, they didn’t find anything and the guys were let go.Flint is at the frontline of so many important themes in America: poverty, race, infrastructure, education, crime, corporate greed, unemployment. I first went there in 2012 to work on a documentary film about Olympic boxer and Flint native Claressa “T-Rex” Shields. I found a community that was far more charismatic and switched on than what had been portrayed in the media. Flint is a complicated place. On one side it’s deep in struggle and tragedy on the other it has a strong, resilient spirit.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4c1139d630a7c0666877be76f16d1e9","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to.

Given that Shami Chakrabarti’s report into antisemitism warned about “Zionist” being used as a stand-in for “Jew”, there is rightly criticism of his language.But the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks has won the hyperbole sweepstakes by branding the comments the most “offensive” by a British politician since Enoch Powell’s infamous “rivers of blood” speech. The claim is as ridiculous as it is offensive – it takes a special kind of amnesia to forget just how racist and isive that speech was.“Rivers of blood” was delivered in opposition to the very first piece of race relations legislation in the country, the Race Relations Act in 1965, which was so weak it has had to be amended numerous times since. The speech invoked images of race war,“wide-grinning piccaninnies” and old white women being afraid to leave their houses because of the scourge of criminal immigrants. Comparing Corbyn’s comments to “Rivers of blood” obscures both the racism of the speech and the fact that it was far from an isolated episode in British political history.Britain has a serious problem with racism in politics, and the unfortunate truth is that, even if Corbyn meant his comments in their most vile form, they probably wouldn’t rank in the top 50 most offensive by a frontline politician. To pick out just a few high-profile examples, in 1978 Margaret Thatcher claimed the nation was being “swamped” by black and brown immigrants, language that the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, again used in 2014, when explaining communities were “under siege” by hordes of migrants. It was only in 1990 that Norman Tebbit suggested that British Asians needed to pass the “cricket test”, supporting England to prove that they belonged to the nation rather than “harking back” to where they “came from”. In 1997, Ann Widdecombe joked that the home secretary, Michael Howard, had “something of the night about him”. Given that Howard is of Jewish heritage, it is not difficult to see how loaded some people might interpret that as being. Worse still, the jibe stuck, and Widdecombe remained unrepentant.And it’s not just the Tories who have been guilty of racist commentary. As prime minister, Tony Blair suggested that there was something distinctive about black culture that led to violent crime, and in 2009, Gordon Brown proudly proclaimed he wanted to create “British jobs for British workers”. The emergence of Ukip has poisoned the political discourse on migration to the point that the left and right are indistinguishable on the issue. Politicians have yet to work out that when Nigel Farage is calling the tune, it is best to stop dancing.After David Cameron took office he used the dispatch box to try to smear Sadiq Khan in his run for London mayor by incorrectly claiming, in April 2016, that he shared platforms with an Islamic State supporter. While Theresa May is very careful with her choice of words, she has presided over the “hostile environment” that included vans telling illegal immigrants to “Go home”, mass deportations and the Windrush scandal, which has devastated the lives of countless people with the legal and historic right to be a part of the nation.That’s not even to mention the offender-in-chief, Boris Johnson, whose lowlights include: invoking Powell by referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles” published articles claiming that black people have lower IQs in the Spectator when editor and, just the other day, causing a furore over his comments about Muslim women and the burqa.The problem of racism in British politics runs to the core of the establishment. By highlighting Corbyn’s comments as some sort of aberration we legitimise the countless examples of racial discrimination in both words and deeds committed by British politicians. Amid the debate around Labour and antisemitism, we should not avoid a serious examination of the issue of racism that runs through the history of all the major parties and the institution as a whole. Of course we should condemn any politician for using racially offensive language, but we have already lost the battle if we pretend that such ideas are the exception and not part of the norm of British political life.• Kehinde Andrews is associate professor in sociology at Birmingham City University and author of Back to Black: Retelling Black Radicalism for the 21st Century"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbdbd3b9769291269888934a64ab5b1e15a35fd8/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ff61fcf9c28460378d417714f2c1d10 1400w","title":"jack ryan reboot overused characters the joker dracula","story":"The release of Amazon’s Jack Ryan marks the fifth time the character has been brought to the screen, one of many who need to be swiftly retiredAdvance word is that John Krasinski’s new Jack Ryan series isn’t very good, but that isn’t news.

Harrison Ford’s Ryan in 1992’s Patriot Games and 1994’s Clear and Present Danger was too generically gruff. Even when played by Alec Baldwin in 1990’s The Hunt For Red October, Ryan ended up as second fiddle to Sean Connery.In fact, you know what? No. None of those Ryan actors did a good job, and none of those films were particularly enjoyable, because Ryan is such a immensely bland character. If Harrison Ford can’t make him work, for crying out loud, then the guy from The Office is really going to struggle. Hollywood has had too many goes at Ryan, and all of them have been duds. It’s time to put Ryan to bed.

He’s been in swashbucklers. He’s been in revisionist romantic dramas. He’s been in children’s TV shows. He’s been a fox in a cartoon. There was Prince of Thieves. There was Men in Tights. There was The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood. Later this year, Leonardo DiCaprio is producing a “hip” take on young Robin Hood starring Taron Egerton. The Wachowskis are working on a Robin Hood adaptation. Disney wants to make a Pirates of the Caribbean-esque Robin Hood movie.

Joaquin Phoenix’s upcoming standalone Joker movie will be make or break for the character.

Still, it’s not like they’re new at flogging a dead horse, because …The most portrayed movie character in history, according to Guinness, Sherlock Holmes has been done to death – and then some.

It spawned six official sequels, seven French made-for-TV movies that were all released in the same year, seven bizarre Emmanuelle in Space movies, seven Emmanuelle 2000 movies, an Emmanuelle Private Collection series which included films like The Art of Ecstasy and Emmanuelle v Dracula, an Emmanuelle Through Time series which included Emmanuelle’s Supernatural Sexual Activity and Emmanuelle’s Sexy Bite.

Honestly, when was the last time you were truly excited about a James Bond film? Never, that’s when. Ever since Sean Connery first played 007 in Dr No, there’s been a clear pattern of excitement, decay and rebirth with James Bond. Sean Connery tipped over into self-parody (yellowface), as did Roger Moore (girdles), Timothy Dalton (boringness), Pierce Brosnan (invisible cars) and Daniel Craig (looking like a nightclub bouncer and never saying anything). The next Bond film is bogged down in so many production woes that pulling the plug seems more like an act of kindness than anything else.

If you wonder how they get it just right, read on ...We may not have the broad repertoire of the Spanish or the delicate touch of the Japanese when it comes to fish, but you can’t get a better bit of batter than that from a decent British chippy – hot from the fryer, crisp and glistening, a golden sarcophagus for the gently steamed fillet within. If you’re somehow not within walking distance of one of these fine institutions, this recipe is the next best thing.For the fish400g plain flour550ml very cold beer4 pieces sustainable white fish (eg hake, haddock, cod, coley)* Dripping or oil, for frying3 tsp baking powder½ tsp saltFor the tartare sauce1 tbsp gherkins1 tbsp capers1 tbsp parsley½ tbsp chives250ml mayonnaise1 tsp dijon mustardPut the flour in a mixing bowl and put in the freezer for 15 minutes before you cook the fish, and, if you’ve forgotten to chill the beer in advance, put that in there, too. This may sound odd, but when cold batter meets hot oil, the change in temperature seems to intensify the reaction as the carbon dioxide in the beer bubbles up, making it extra crisp.You can use just about any white fish you like, the more sustainable the better – the Marine Conservation Society has guidance on its website. Keep the skin on or remove it according to taste – it’s generally left on in the south removed in the north – and check for and discard any small bones that may have been left in.in a deep-fat fryer to 185C365F. I like the flavour of the former, but it does have a rather pervasive smell, so if you’re sensitive to such things, or don’t eat beef, then a neutral oil will do just as well – you could even use extra-virgin olive oil if you like, as this is below its smoke point, but it will be expensive.You can use a large, heavy-based pan and a thermometer instead make sure you fill the pan no more than a third of the way up with oil. If you don’t have a thermometer, drop a cube of bread in the oil to check the temperature: it should crisp and brown in 30 seconds.When the fat is nearly up to temperature, stir the baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt into the chilled flour, then whisk in the cold beer to make a paste – don’t overmix or you’ll make the batter tough. Put this by the fryer or hob, along with a metal slotted spoon and a plate lined with kitchen paper.If you’d prefer not to use beer, then you can substitute very cold fizzy water: the bubbles are the important bit, although the beer does give a good flavour. You may wish to add a pinch of sugar to make up for it, or indeed a pinch of mustard powder or some cayenne pepper if you’d like the batter to have a bit of heat.Dip the fish into the batter, one piece at a time, then, shaking off any excess, carefully lower into the hot fat and agitate the basket, or very carefully stir with the slotted spoon to prevent it sticking. You can do this two or three pieces at a time, but make sure you don’t overcrowd the pan or it will overflow.Cook the fish for four to six minutes, depending on the size of the fillets, until crisp and deep golden in colour, keeping a watchful eye on it at all times: never leave hot fat unattended. Scoop out with the slotted spoon and on to the kitchen paper to drain before serving.To make tartare sauce to go with the fish and chipsinely chop the gherkins, capers and parsley and chives and mix into the mayonnaise, along with two or three tablespoons of the pickling liquor from the gherkins and the dijon mustard.

With CNN’s Anthony Bourdain documentary not out for at least another year, and the next episode of the Great British Bake Off almost a whole week away, here’s a list of all the food shows you should be watching instead.Somebody Feed Phil Netflix Everybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal isn’t a travel expert or a food expert. However, he has a food-based travelogue on Netflix, which is probably down to his general enthusiam for both. Over the course of 10 episodes, he travels the world, from Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City, sampling the food and saying “Wow” a lot. This is as undemanding as food shows get, and that is saying something.Ugly Delicious NetflixDavid Chang has inserted himself as Netflix’s official food ambassador and Ugly Delicious is the centrepiece of his empire. Every episode, Chang and his friends go deep on a different type of junk food, exploring issues such as the links between fried chicken and racism or the US’s bastardisation of fried rice. Ugly Delicious can get a little up itself at times, but the pizza episode – where Chang nearly gets into a fistfight with an artisanal chef for declaring his love for Domino’s – makes great TV.Zumbo’s Just Desserts NetflixA sort of Australian Bake Off, Zumbo’s Just Desserts tasks contestants with making a new sweet treat per episode – a foot-high pudding, a gravity-defying dessert, something called a Franken-dessert – and it is just as fluffy and fun as you would expect. Plus, Rachel Khoo is in it – so that’s what she has been up to lately.Chef’s Table NetflixNetflix food shows are easy to spot, because they are the ones that treat food with a hysterical awestruck reverence that borders on religious. Chef’s Table is the epicentre of this approach. Each episode meets a new chef from around the world and basically lies prostrate before them while classical music plays in the background. Some of the episodes are great – Christina Tosi’s is a standout – but any more than three in a row and you will want to gorge on a Big Mac out of spite.The Mind of a Chef NetflixPBS’s The Mind of a Chef is slightly more playful than Chef’s Table – the chefs tend to get an entire series to themselves, so they are free to wander off down knotty little cul-de-sacs – but it is still relatively polite. April Bloomfield, the star of series two, is an absolute delight. In a world of celebrity chefs, her palpable awkwardness in front of camera is refreshing.Cooked NetflixEpisodes are titled Fire, Water, Air and Earth, which might suggest that Cooked is unbearably pretentious. And, to be fair, it is. It is food writer Michael Pollan exploring the evolution of our relationship with food in all manner of hifalutin’ ways. However, it is also an absolute work of art to look at. The Air episode, all about bread, is like visual ASMR.Last Call Food Brawl NetflixDespite its culinary loftiness, Netflix isn’t above indulging in the sort of dirty gluttony that made Man v Food such a success. Last Call Food Brawl has a loud host, aggressive music and tons of hipsters shouting at pork. This is either your sort of show or it isn’t.Fuck, That’s Delicious Now TVOne of my favourites. The host, Action Bronson, used to be a chef, and he now travels a lot for his day job as a rapper, so this show instantly feels more authentic than Somebody Feed Phil, and less stuffy than Chef’s Table. It is part cookery, part documentary and part weird state-of-the-world poetry. If anyone in the world will replace Anthony Bourdain, it will be Bronson.Rick Stein’s Seafood Odyssey iPlayerShows don’t tend to stick around on iPlayer for more than a month. However, some of its classic food shows are now permanent fixtures. This 1999 series, where Rick Stein developed his skill for going to new countries and complaining that Britain isn’t more like them, is one of them. It is probably Stein’s best.Floyd on France (iPlayer)Over the years, Keith Floyd developed a reputation for being drunk and uncooperative. But in this 1987 series, he’s on fine form curious and observant, regaling viewers with all manner of charmingly rambling anecdotes. Food is almost an afterthought, which is possibly for the best, since a lot of it looks grey and boiled. The series, however, is tremendous.Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas iPlayerA 1975 series that feels as if it has been beamed in from a different universe. Cradock is in her prime, covered in massive brooches and with eyebrows painted halfway up her forehead. She shouts at her audience as if she can barely stand to be in the same room. Nothing looks appetising and it is all very stressful. We have come so far since Cradock’s day, but have lost so much.Nailed It! NetflixNailed It! doesn’t bill itself as the anti-Bake Off, but that is what it is. Contestants try to replicate cake recipes they have found on the internet and almost always bodge them beyond all recognition. It is a brilliant premise, let down only by airless, edited-to-death American presentation.Kantaro the Sweet-Toothed Salaryman NetflixThis takes some explaining. Kantaro is a Japanese drama about a man with a near-sexual fetish for puddings. Every day, he sneaks out from work, samples a new Japanese dessert, explains what makes it unique, eats it and has what appears to be an orgasm that brings about hallucinations. It is brilliant and stupid in equal measure, although the episode about Kantaro’s mum probably crosses the line of decency.

McKinley said: “I think it takes us back to the role football clubs have a part in the community beyond football. A lot of smaller clubs were quick to come on board because they’re perhaps a bit more in tune with what their fanbase wants. Bbut in terms of visibility it’s great to have a Premier League club on board.”The trio in charge of the campaign admitted it was awkward initially discussing periods with iniduals, who are often middle-aged men, in football boardrooms. McKinley said: “We don’t want to force any clubs to do anything but we want to empower supporters to encourage their clubs to provide free sanitary products either by making existing dispensing machines free of charge or by making boxes of tampons and sanitary towels available. It’s our experience that they will only be used in emergencies anyway.”The campaign went viral on social media when one football fan tweeted a picture of a basket full of sanitary towels and tampons at Barnsley’s Oakwell stadium. “It’s important for football clubs to be inclusive and we hope this will encourage female fans to think they are being listened to,” McKinley added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e287a10efdca37d56ae48ccaa3c5a7339d70fa6/174_65_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bb8801d282640c82e6e056b8fb212cb","title":"luke shaw england recall ashley young gareth southgate","story":"• Young out of England squad to play Spain and Switzerland • Full-back said to understand Gareth Southgate’s decisionAshley Young will be an absentee on Thursday when Gareth Southgate names his first England squad since the run to the World Cup semi-finals, with the manager considering a recall for Luke Shaw.Southgate has spoken to Young who, unlike Jamie Vardy and Gary Cahill, has no intention of retiring from the national team, having played such a key role in Russia, not least with his set-piece delivery.The 33-year-old played in all but the two games against Belgium, having been welcomed back into the fold last November after a four-year absence. Although his appetite to represent his country remains fierce, he understands the manager’s reasoning as England explore their options.Young’s club-mate Shaw is under consideration to step up as a replacement for the Nations League match against Spain at Wembley a week on Saturday and the friendly with Switzerland at Leicester three days later. The 23-year-old has played once under Southgate, gaining his seventh and most recent cap against Germany in March 2017, but has impressed this season despite Manchester United’s stuttering start.Southgate was in attendance at Old Trafford on Monday to witness Shaw’s performance against Tottenham, for whom Danny Rose played. Leicester’s Ben Chilwell and Ryan Bertrand of Southampton are alternative options at left wing-back.Joe Gomez, who missed the World Cup through injury, will return after an excellent start to the season at Liverpool. He will in effect replace the experienced Cahill, who announced this week he wished to take a “step back” from England commitments as he seeks to regain a place in Chelsea’s lineup.Southgate will retain faith with the majority of the squad who did so well in Russia but the United defender Phil Jones is expected to miss out through injury after limping away from Monday’s defeat by Spurs. Burnley’s James Tarkowski, on standby in the summer, is his expected replacement.Southampton’s Alex McCarthy could step in for Nick Pope, a long-term absentee after dislocating a shoulder in Burnley’s Europa League qualifier at Aberdeen. The manager and his assistant, Steve Holland, have watched McCarthy’s recent games against Everton and Leicester. The goalkeeper, uncapped but called up by Roy Hodgson in 2013 and Sam Allardyce in 2016, is likely to earn a recall ahead of Joe Hart, who is gaining regular playing time after moving to Burnley. Jack Butland is likely to be retained despite playing in the Championship with Stoke.Vardy’s retirement, revealed by the  on Tuesday, offers a forward a route into the squad. Southgate has been impressed by the uncapped Callum Wilson’s start to the campaign. The 26-year-old has sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries in both knees since Bournemouth’s promotion to the Premier League, wrecking two of his top-flight campaigns, but has scored twice this season. Arsenal’s Danny Welbeck is likely to keep his place Daniel Sturridge, fit again after a promising pre-season for Liverpool, is a possible alternative and Jadon Sancho’s performances for Borussia Dortmund have been noted.Sancho could join Phil Foden and Ryan Sessegnon in the under-21s – they have European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands and Latvia – and it remains to be seen whether Ruben Loftus-Cheek, limited to a solitary appearance as a substitute for Chelsea this season, retains his place in the senior squad.Ross Barkley has enjoyed more game time at Chelsea, while Southgate and his staff have also monitored Will Hughes’s progress at Watford. Adam Lallana is fit again having missed the World Cup after an injury-wrecked season for Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f28e92533f40a0755731fce5616f16215d060d/0_108_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4e2c92ee7591f24e35eed0826073ad","title":"manchester united anthony martial contract","story":"• Board keen to hold on to previously disaffected player • Move is understood to have José Mourinho’s backingManchester United are in discussions with Anthony Martial about a new contract, in a move the board are confident has José Mourinho’s backing despite the manager previously being minded to allow him to depart.Martial has been disaffected under the manager, and considered ending his Old Trafford career. Mourinho also wanted the forward to leave, questioning his attitude and contribution to the team, and was content for him to be sold in the summer window.On the face of it, United’s bid to retain Martial could potentially put more strain on relations between manager and hierarchy after the club refused to grant Mourinho sufficient finances to buy a central defender of choice in the summer.Yet it is understood the board are confident of Mourinho’s support over Martial, and the move to prolong the player’s United career indicates their belief that the 22-year-old is yet to fulfil a potential that could make him one of the world’s elite players. The hope is that Martial will agree terms.Mourinho’s side have lost two of their opening three matches – at Brighton and on Monday night against Tottenham at Old Trafford. Following that defeat an angry Mourinho stormed out of the media conference demanding more “respect” from journalists. His next public briefing is on Friday when he is bound to be asked about Martial and the apparent reversal of his stance that the Frenchman can leave.Martial’s current terms end next year, though United have an option to extend to 2020. When signing in the summer of 2015 from Monaco under Louis van Gaal, Martial cost £36m, then a world record for a teenager, with the fee rising to £57m.In some quarters the board’s discussions with Martial might be interpreted as a further example of an erosion of Mourinho’s control over transfers, with United set to appoint a first director of football in the club’s 140-year history, as revealed in the\u0026nbspObserver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646a8357635baaaacd942df5418fd1bca824b806/499_354_2487_1493/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355f3482225762d0019b8db263f9743b","title":"nottingham forest newcastle united efl cup match report","story":"For two minutes Newcastle thought they had got away with it.

Forest made merry against a Newcastle team bordering on ridiculous.Aitor Karanka can take encouragement from Forest’s entertaining and effective display, which tournament organisers can cite as evidence that the Carabao Cup still has relevancy despite low attendances.

Whether because of a lack of desire or a dearth of quality, this looked for a long time like an exercise in clock-punching by the bland men in black and white.Without a Premier League win and eliminated at the first hurdle from this tournament, Newcastle’s ambition remains a point of fierce contention between Benítez and Mike Ashley. The manager made seven changes to the lineup who tried to barricade themselves into their own box against Chelsea on Sunday but Benítez insisted “no one can say anything about that because the team was still capable of winning” against hosts who are 13th in the Championship.Forest made alterations, too. Karanka selected only six of the players who started their last Championship match but from the start Forest’s swift fluency contrasted starkly with Newcastle’s listlessness.Joe Lolley served notice inside the first minute, tearing through midfield before teeing up Dias for a shot from 20 yards that forced Karl Darlow into a ing save. Newcastle did not wake up and one minute later they were a goal down. Dias raced along the right wing before crossing for Murphy, who\u0026nbspheaded in at the near post.Forest continued to threaten, Lolley’s dribbling a particular delight. Newcastle struggled to cobble together moves and when they did so their workings were obvious. Forest were rarely stretched. Joselu nodded wide from close range from a corner in the 36th minute.Newcastle nearly conceded again within five minutes of the second half with Murphy foiled by a fine tackle by Federico Fernández after Darlow had spilled a shot by Dias. Michael Hefele gave Newcastle’s markers the slip from the corner but headed wide from close range.João Carvalho tried to deepen Newcastle’s woe just after the hour but his chip from a tight angle – more imaginative than anything produced by the Premier League team – bounced out off the crossbar.Rondón came to their rescue, the second-half substitute lashing in a low shot from 10 yards. Newcastle celebrated. Then they switched off.Darlow palmed a cross by Dias into the path of Cash, who drove into the net from 12 yards. Then, after Newcastle were denied a penalty for a foul on Ayoze Pérez by the Forest goalkeeper Luke Steele, Kenedy’s sloppy touch presented the ball to Dias, who looped it over Darlow from the edge of the box.It was no more than both teams deserved. Benítez disagreed. “The penalty was so obvious, we have the feeling we deserved more,” he said. “We did not manage the start well but then we had a lot of control. The positive thing is a lot of players did well in terms of effort. It was a question of managing better these final minutes.”Everton’s unbeaten start to the season continued with a 3-1 victory against Rotherham that puts them into the third round. After Gylfi Sigurdsson opened the scoring from close range, Dominic Calvert‑Lewin scored twice – either side of Will Vaulks’s late header for the visitors. The result gives Marco Silva his second win as Everton manager. Millwall fought back from 2-1 down to win 3-2, after initially going behind to Jamie Ness’s 41st-minute opener for Plymouth Argyle. After Shaun Williams equalised from the spot, Argyle once again took the lead through Freddie Ladapo before an 83rd-minute equaliser from Lee Gregory was followed by the 89th-minute winner from Aiden O’Brien. Watford ran out comfortable winners over Reading, with goals from Isaac Success and Domingos Quina sealing a 2-0 win.Benítez also claimed “the atmosphere is quite good” in the Newcastle camp despite reports of a training ground row between players last week. “You want players competing, players who care,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6805d7f5d95a2b76b18499837ba8505ec8239e3e/0_186_4327_2596/master/4327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e48c2fb4ca59d9c7ee5ef163f77965","title":"sam allardyce loses case against daily telegraph","story":"The former England manager Sam Allardyce has lost his complaint that the Daily  broke journalism’s rules by sending an undercover reporter to propose a business deal and discuss rules on the third-party ownership of footballers.Allardyce lost his job managing the national team in September 2016 as a result of the sting, in which one of the newspaper’s reporters posed as a representative of a fake sports management agency and secretly recorded their conversations. The press regulator Ipso concluded that the Daily ’s subterfuge was justified on the basis that it was a “productive and proportionate” way to investigate the types of commercial relationships Allardyce was willing to consider and the findings “could reasonably be considered to demonstrate sufficiently serious impropriety” to justify publication.The regulator concluded that while Allardyce, who was due to earn £3m a year as England manager, did not break Football Association rules he did “show a disregard for them” by discussing potential workarounds on rules regarding the third-party ownership of players– a practice banned in England and “widely regarded as ethically wrong” – and there was a clear public interest in reporting this.The England manager also entertained the idea of undertaking speaking engagements for the Daily ’s fake company for £400,000 a year, while making it clear that this would need the approval of his employers at the FA.“The newspaper had also gathered evidence that he was willing to negotiate speaker fees with a company that was explicitly interested in third-party ownership of players,” said the regulator. “During the second meeting, he had witnessed a conversation in which a football agent appeared to suggest that an unauthorised payment could be made to a player.”The 17,000-word ruling was delivered following an investigation into complaints by Allardyce, his agent Shane Moloney, and accountant Mark Curtis that they had been misrepresented and their quotes taken out of context.The manager has always insisted the sting was unfair because, as the regulator stressed, no rules were broken. He also complained that the coverage was unfair since it was linked to a wider investigation into “corruption”, suggesting serious wrongdoing.However, Ipso concluded that the matter was still in the public interest because of the high standards expected of such a prominent inidual and ruled it was fair comment for the  to say that Allardyce had “tried to make as much money as possible as England manager”.The regulator did rule that among the 15 articles published by the Daily  about Allardyce during September 2016 there were three significant inaccuracies that required correction.One related to a false suggestion the manager had implied third parties could benefit from transfer fees. The other two wrongly implied Allardyce had offered to brief the Daily ’s fake company on how to break ownership rules, rather than merely being willing to consider speaking at their events.The regulator’s verdict approving the subterfuge relied partly on the fact that the Daily  said it was acting on anonymous allegations against Allardyce dating back to early 2015 that he should be investigated, in addition to a tip-off from an anonymous “specific football agent”.The FA sacked Allardyce, who was last season also sacked as Everton manager, the day after the allegations were first published.In a statement issued last night Allardyce insisted that IPSO’s ruling was flawed, the  “had put words into my mouth” and called on the journalists involved to hand back awards they won for the coverage.He also criticised the leadership of the FA and how they handled their response to the story: “It was clear that those that I was dealing with were more concerned with their own image than getting to the truth of what had occurred. I will consider my position in this regard with my lawyers but I hope Martin Glenn and Greg Clarke reflect on the lack of leadership that they showed – not for the first time or I expect the last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbae3ab36840530c0850fa57d114ed59de22b1d7/0_132_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86456afc50b96fa3aaafac3230c33087","title":"wolves make a point against city red cards ham and more football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Tariq Panja to discuss Manchester City’s dropped points, a isive handball, interesting red card decisions, poorly-laid turf and hams on Ryanair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e9960a3d377bae707d2e6360c49051016b2474/0_124_2924_1755/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfabb202f8a6b8a8e73213f18f20e2f8","title":"how audiobooks turned me into a runner at 50","story":"Tired of having to interrupt your routine to change the song? You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Flat Tummy Co, an online retailer that had previously existed almost exclusively within the digital confines of Instagram, arrived in New York City like Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita updated into a 21st-century boss babe.The product for sale – 35 calories worth of flavored cane sugar laced with an extract of saffron that supposedly curbs hunger – sparked immediate backlash for a company that had built its brand selling so-called “detox” teas. Good Place actor Jameela Jamil called out Kim Kardashian West for promoting the lollipops to her 116 million Instagram followers (“You terrible and toxic influence on young girls,” Jamil tweeted), and more than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the billboard’s removal.Flat Tummy Co’s response has been to keep calm and ’gram on. The company is the ultimate Instagram brand success story: a perfect example of how unregulated social media marketing practices can repackage questionable science in the feelgood trappings of a wellness brand and spin women’s insecurities into cash. And Instagram, which claims to want to be “one of the most kind and safe” places on the internet, has neither the power nor the will to police it.“It’s not a positive message for women, is it? It’s pretty bad,” said one former Flat Tummy Co employee, who spoke to the  on condition of anonymity, about the company’s move into selling appetite suppressants. “The ex-employees are all quite close … Everyone’s just kind of, ‘Ugh, we were a part of that.’”The former employee argued that the outrage toward the Kardashians was misdirected: “Why is no one calling out the company? This isn’t about them. It’s the company that’s the problem.”Flat Tummy Tea debuted on Instagram on 14 June 2013. It took time for the company to develop its current Instaesthetic: the tea was originally sold in transparent plastic bags that showed off the product’s earthiness the label was a purplish blue the font had yet to lose its serifs.But the beginnings of a brand identity were apparent from the outset: aspirational images of beautiful women with tiny stomachs and big butts, before and after shots of customers’ bloated and deflated bellies, and a studied mix of pseudo-feminist millennial boss bitch attitude: mason jar smoothies, jokes about alcohol, girl power slogans, an assortment of healthy-ish dishes, junk food and pink workout gear, and the odd inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela.Laramie Taylor, a professor of communication at UC Davis who researches media and idealized bodies, described the body image the brand promotes – “a very flat and toned stomach but the bust and posterior of someone whose body mass index is considerably higher” – as absurdly unrealistic.“It comes down to this idea of setting expectations for women that are frequently contradictory and impossible to satisfy,” Taylor said.The company was a humble affair at first, according to an interview founders Bec and Tim Polmear gave to a Tasmanian business publication in 2017 (they declined to speak to the ). The tea was reportedly formulated to treat Bec Polmear’s “digestion and bloating”, and they manufactured it in their home garage in Australia with ingredients purchased from a local herbalist.The company’s first coup was a social media post by a popular nutrition blogger from New Zealand. “We had 17 orders in an hour and thought we’d struck gold,” Ted Polmear explained.From there, the company started paying Instagram influencers and built an algorithm that could predict a model’s sales potential, Polmear said. By November 2015, the brand had racked up 500,000 Instagram followers and was sold to Canada’s Synergy CHC Corp for $10m in cash and stock.In interviews with the , two former Flat Tummy Co employees described the process by which the company flooded Instagram with thousands of paid-for posts.Each week, they were tasked with identifying and contacting between 150 and 200 new influencers, with the goal of getting 50 to 60 of them on board for a series of four promotional posts each. The ideal model was a woman with at least 100,000 followers.“They had a rating system, depending on how ‘on brand’ you were,” explained one of the former employees. “You don’t want someone who already has a six pack. You want a mum who is on her fit journey trying to lose weight after having kids.”African American and Latina models were prized because their posts “converted” well into sales, while models were downgraded if they were too “slutty” on the assumption that their followers would be mostly male.“If someone is a little bit bigger, they get a higher rating than if someone’s skinny,” one former employee said. “No one is going to a listen to a skinny white girl say that she bought this tea and it’s great.”Added the other former employee: “If they were sexier, showed a lot of skin, or showed too much boobs, it was like, ‘Don’t pay them, try to get free posts.’”Valentina Barron, a spokeswoman for Flat Tummy Co, told the  by email: “The ambassadors we collaborate with are a mix of all different types of women, because that’s what our customers are. Women can experience bloating, digestive issues or anything else in between no matter what their size.”The former employees said they were pressured to keep the cost of influencer posts down. While the Kardashians reportedly earn six-figure fees for their Instagram ads, the influencers that the former employees worked with were “lucky to get $25 to $50”, one of the former employees said. “You basically had to cut them down and say, ‘You’re not worth that much money.’”Once an influencer agreed to the deal, the staffers would direct how their photos should look and write copy for the captions: “We never expected them to actually use the tea. It just had to look like it.”Barron disputed that point: “We specifically request and most certainly expect, that all of our ambassadors try and love our products. That’s why they’re our ambassadors!”Both employees said they were disappointed with the company’s current direction.“They always used to preach this whole, ‘We’re not a weight loss company. We just want to be healthy,’” one said. “Which has obviously changed with these lollipops.”Flat Tummy Co nevertheless still claims that it cares about “health” above all.“Our brand is all about helping women look and feel like the best versions of themselves and our mission statement is to empower women to lead a healthier lifestyle,” Barron said.But medical and nutritional experts harshly criticized the company’s products and claims.“Dietary supplements sold for detox or weight loss are snake oil, plain and simple,” said Dr S Bryn Austin, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in eating disorder risks. “The liver and kidneys already do the the so-called detox and adding junk products into the diet only makes their job harder. And weight loss claims for these products are either outright sham or a result of adulteration of the products with potentially dangerous stimulants, laxatives or diuretics.”Dr Rachel Scherr, a researcher at UC Davis’s department of nutrition, reviewed the ingredients included in Flat Tummy Co’s products at the ’s request, and raised numerous concerns. All the products rely on ingredients that are classified as nutritional supplements, rather than drugs, which means that they are untested and unregulated.Flat Tummy Co’s tea contains senna, a laxative, which Scherr said could help with bloating but could also lead to dependence on laxatives. The company’s meal replacement shakes include “patented and clinically studied Super Citrimax” – an extract of garcinia cambogia, which has been hawked as a miracle weight loss drug by the likes of Dr Oz but which Scherr noted has been “conclusively determined” to have no link to weight loss or fat loss.As for the lollipops, they include Satiereal, which Flat Tummy calls a “clinically proven safe active ingredient”. Scherr pointed out that the study touted by Satiereal’s French manufacturer is from 2010, while a study published in 2018 found “no effects” on weight loss.Scherr also criticized the “tips” for your “health kick” published on the company’s website, which include “Cut back on veggies.”“Does this company really recommend eating fewer vegetables?” Scherr asked. “That is not good advice!”Barron defended Flat Tummy Co in her statement, writing: “We never have, and never will – promote unhealthy eating behaviours or anything of that nature. Every product we’ve created for this brand, and everything we do with this brand, is all about motivating women to make positive, healthy changes in their lives, and our products are designed to give them the boost in the right direction that they might be missing.”To Claire Mysko, the chief executive officer of the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), this is nothing but a rhetorical ploy.“There is a shift away from language that explicitly talks about weight loss and a shift toward wellness and lifestyle changes,” she said. “It’s the same old products marketed in new language.”Both Mysko and Taylor, the UC Davis professor, expressed special concern over the marketing of the products on social media, especially since influencer posts are rarely labeled as advertisements, despite Instagram’s creation of a “paid partnership” label.“We’re comparing our real self to someone else’s made-up, photoshopped, carefully composed, idealized self,” Taylor said. “And ultimately that is exactly what the people who want to sell us these products need. They need us to feel bad about ourselves so we buy their product.”Instagram is fully aware of the dangers of spreading unrealistic body expectations. The company has banned various “thinspiration” and pro-eating disorder hashtags, and worked with NEDA on initiatives like an eating disorder help page and eating disorder recovery hashtag.“Every day people come to Instagram to build communities of support, particularly around body image,” spokeswoman Stephanie Noon said in a statement. “We are committed to making Instagram one of the most kind and safe platforms, and we will continue to shed light on the people redefining body image and encouraging body positivity in our community.”Indeed, Instagram has a number of policies designed to combat advertiser efforts to “generate negative self-perception” in order to sell health, fitness or weight loss products. Ads for such products are prohibited from targeting minors and from using “before and after” images or images that feature on “zoomed body parts”.And yet Flat Tummy Co is almost entirely immune to Instagram’s strictures because those policies only apply when an advertiser pays Instagram to promote their posts, not when the advertiser pays an influencer. So Flat Tummy Co can run as many “before and after” shots of zoomed in bellies as it wants – and it runs a lot of them – as long as it doesn’t pay Instagram to boost the posts’ audience. And if Flat Tummy Co wants to target teenage girls, it need only find an influencer with a young fanbase.Asked about this giant loophole, Noon responded, “We are looking at this area closely and trying to understand areas for improvement, so we can help our community navigate this type of content.”In the meantime, the combination of Instagram and Flat Tummy Co remains an astonishingly unhealthy brew.“Personally I will never buy something that has been recommended to me on Instagram,” said one of the former Flat Tummy Co employees. “I just know that there’s someone pulling the strings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97965039afe8c9d49ef010d1ce0f83e514ff91b8/0_176_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0d04212c600b38be174fbb6ee94dba9","title":"ikea safety recall hob carbon monoxide","story":"I noticed it was on a recall list because of dangerous fumes ... but that was six weeks ago To my surprise, about six weeks ago, I noticed on the Ikea website the kitchen hob I bought from them in 2016 was being recalled.

The couple reportedly wed on Saturday in Atascadero, after a ceremony on Young’s yacht near the San Juan islands.The guitarist Mark Miller appeared to confirm the news on Facebook when he congratulated the couple. He later clarified that he had not attended the ceremony. “I only knew about it because one of my friends attended the ceremony in Atascadero and announced it on his page,” Miller said.The administrator of Young’s blog also congratulated the pair, and referred to comments from attendees, who described the event as “a shindig”.Hannah posted a cryptic image to her Instagram account the following day. She captioned the picture of an owl: “Someone’s watching over us … love and only love.”Young and Hannah had reportedly been dating since 2014, when Young filed for orce from Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years. On the media scrutiny surrounding his relationship with Hannah, Young said: “We didn’t pay any attention to that. It doesn’t matter. We don’t give a shit. We don’t care, because they don’t know what they’re talking about. And if they do know what they’re talking about, we still don’t care, but we’re happy for them. It doesn’t matter. What matters is us, not the press.”This year, Young appeared in the Netflix film Paradox, a fantasy western musical directed by Hannah.At 72, it marks another chapter in Young’s life and work, as he continues to press on with new music. He has released six albums in the last four years, including two with a new backing band, Promise of the Real, who feature Willie Nelson’s son Lukas among their number. Long irritated by what he perceives as low quality digital music from Apple, Spotify and others, he has also recently created an ambitious online archive of his work in high-resolution audio. In December 2017, he sold off 418 lots of his possessions at auction, raising over $300,000 from his model train collection alone.Hannah continues to act – her most high profile recent role was Angelica Turing in the sci-fi Netflix series Sense8, a show whose cult popularity was so strong that fans successfully lobbied for a final “goodbye” episode after it was cancelled, which aired in June this year. But she is also a high-profile activist, having long campaigned against the Keystone oil pipeline system in Canada and the US. She has been arrested numerous times for her protests – including twice in front of the White House – and she and Young led a Washington-based march together in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0a52c5032d72b950fe06c198b26a6d0e12e248/0_336_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc2486fdc17d7f45c4b12af203f9b401 740w","title":"brexit dominic raab frustrated by michel barnier lack of availability on talks","story":"UK wants more meetings but Michele Barnier indicates realism needed in approachDominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has expressed his frustration to EU officials over Michel Barnier’s alleged failure to make himself available for face-to-face talks.Despite the EU negotiator’s claims that he was available “247” for talks, Barnier was said to have been resistant to requests for lengthy meetings with Raab to discuss the details of the UK’s proposals, hammered out at Chequers.The British cabinet minister was granted only a two-hour meeting with Barnier last week, and was initially offered only a three-hour slot this Friday, due to the former French minister’s diary constraints, the  has learned.Barnier – who tweeted a picture of himself on Sunday posing in the sun in Albertville, in his home region of Savoie in south-east France – has been in Germany, and was understood to be again leaving Brussels for Croatia on Friday afternoon, following what was set to be an early morning meeting with Raab.Barnier subsequently changed his flights, however.

The aim of the meetings between the principals is to take stock of progress made at technical and coordinator level.”Raab, who was appearing before a House of Lords committee on Wednesday, insisted that a deal was in sight. “I think it is important as we enter the final phase of the negotiations in the lead-up to the October council – and the possibility that it may creep beyond that – we want to see some renewed energy,” he told peers.He struck an upbeat note throughout most of the 90-minute questioning, saying he was “stubbornly optimistic”, and would not “beg” the EU for a deal.However, he appeared to question whether Britain would consider itself bound to pay the almost £40bn financial settlement it agreed to last December, if a final deal is not forthcoming by March. “I don’t think it could be safely assumed on anyone’s side that the financial settlement that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal bill would then just be paid, in precisely the same shape or speed or rate, if there was no deal,” he said.The remaining challenges were laid bare when Barnier, who met the German foreign affairs minister on Wednesday in Berlin and will hold talks with the German minister for the economy on Thursday, reiterated his stance that the UK’s proposals on cross border trade in goods after Brexit would undermine the EU’s single market.Ahead of his face-to-face talks on Friday with Raab, Barnier admitted that the negotiations were at a difficult and sensitive stage.He said: “We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country. “We respect Britain’s red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are. Single market means single market ... There is no single market à la carte.”Barnier added that Norway’s model, under which the UK would allow free movement of people in return for the benefits of the free flow of trade, was still available.Currency traders appeared to interpret Barnier’s comments as a sign that the British government’s lobbying in favour of the Chequers proposals was working, pushing sterling to a three-week high against the dollar – an understanding that EU sources were quick to quash.Barnier has claimed repeatedly in past months that the economic and security deal so far offered by Brussels, dismissed as unacceptable by Downing Street, is unlike anything the EU has struck before.The two sides pledged earlier this summer to have continuous Brexit talks in the final stage of the negotiations, with Barnier insisting a deal needed to be struck by “the beginning of November, but not much later than that”.But UK officials were said to be “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to their pledges to intensify talks at the highest level. The issue has been a reversal of the positions earlier in the talks, when Barnier made the point to EU diplomats in private that he would have liked to see more of David Davis, the then Brexit secretary, in Brussels.The tension in the talks has been exacerbated by a lack of progress in the negotiations last week, despite claims by both sides that the discussions had been “positive”. has learned that discussions over Northern Ireland proved to be some of the most difficult yet, with both sides digging in. Irish government officials, briefed on the meeting, were told that the UK side had insisted that progress on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland could not be made unless there was progress on Chequers.The EU, in turn, repeated that the British government needed to live up to the commitments it made on an “all-weather” solution to avoiding a hard border through a backstop solution in the withdrawal agreement, which would snap into place if a wider deal or bespoke technological solution did not solve the problem.Sources said the talks were so difficult that the only positive that could be taken was that the clash between the officials had been aired now rather than later in the year.Asked by peers about the frequency of talks on Wednesday, Raab said, “in relation to whatever tittle-tattle may appear in whatever newspapers, I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday: I hope that gives you the facts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552e9dd19ba12182e750da68eafa97fee6bc5c38/0_538_3224_1933/master/3224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58fbb934ff2933d4b00705520cd4ab43","title":"new party members are not entryists say pro brexit tory mps","story":"Concerns raised by remainers about influx of Eurosceptics dismissed by party’s right wingConservative MPs warning of “entryism” in their party have faced a backlash from colleagues, who say the party should welcome an influx of new Brexit-supporting members.Leave.EU, the campaign group founded by businessman Arron Banks, is calling on its supporters to join the Conservative party to influence a future leadership vote, leading some remain-supporting MPs, including Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, to call for vigilance.But Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow and chair of the Commons education committee, dismissed those fears on Wednesday, and suggested Soubry and her allies instead recruit supporters from their own wing of the party.Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, who resigned as a deputy chair of the party in protest over the prime minister’s Chequers deal, said he had also seen local membership rise since he took the seat from Labour at last year’s general election.Banks himself was refused membership earlier this month but continues to spearhead a bid to persuade Eurosceptics to join the Tory party.Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of the pro-Brexit candidates favoured by Banks and his allies, has disowned their efforts, saying: “They’re not doing it in my name. Of course I want people to join the Conservative party, but I want them to join because they support a broad swath of values.”Meanwhile, chairs of local Conservative associations are being reminded to check new members regularly and weed out those “whose declared opinions or conduct shall, in their judgement, be inconsistent with the objects or financial well-being of the association, or likely to bring the party into disrepute”.In a letter obtained by the Guido Fawkes website, the party’s head of membership, Natalie Crosby-Jones, reminds constituency chairs that they have an obligation to scrutinise members before confirming their membership on the party’s internal system. “Please check these iniduals carefully before you click ‘Approve’,” she wrote.With Theresa May facing an intensely challenging six months, and a growing number of her own MPs restless about the Chequers deal, the prospect of a leadership contest looks increasingly likely. Grassroots members would then have the final say, after MPs whittled the candidates down to two.When asked en route to South Africa earlier this week about whether she would step aside if she faced a vote of no confidence, May insisted she was “in it for the long term” but few in Westminster expect her to stay on much beyond March next year, when Britain is due to leave the EU.Campaign groups on both sides of the Brexit ide are readying themselves for the battle ahead, as negotiations in Brussels reach their final months.Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage emailed supporters of Leave Means Leave, the hardline Brexit group he recently joined, summoning them to a rally in Bolton in September.“We need to mobilise and do whatever it takes to get the Brexit we voted for. We need to pressure the government into chucking Chequers and supporting a world trade deal,” he said.“I want to see a bigger crowd than the remainers can produce. We’ve got to show them we mean business,” he said. Tickets to the rally are £5."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281e33bf292551d314e425f3fa3f0cbce6735d6f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2a684384697dad74dcf9ace878cd83d","title":"rent was astronomical people on why they left london in their 30s","story":"We asked those who left the capital in their 30s to tell us why they ditched the capitalAccording to a report in June from the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the expensive property prices in London are leading to an exodus of people in their early 30s. Once housing costs are taken into account incomes in London were £21,350, compared to £22,250 across the UK. We hear from some of those who left London in their 30s and how their lives have changed since leaving the capital.“London is a hard place to live. If you’re struggling financially, living there can feel like you’re fighting a battle you’re certain to lose. But it’s tough in many other ways too. It can be a very lonely place. I was miles from many of my close friends I shared a city with - friends I see more now I’ve left than I did when I was there. My partner and I (now wife) left in the summer of 2016. We moved to Bristol, as her family are from this part of the world and it still felt doable for our jobs. We were 30 when we left. As with so many people our age, we left out of desire to own our own house. We hadn’t even really considered leaving London until we started pursuing the idea of what we could afford to borrow for our mortgage. We were very quickly faced with the realisation that whatever we could afford to buy in London would be a huge step down from our cosy North London one-bed flat. We decided to make the leap and we’re so glad we did. It’s felt feels like the best decision we’ve ever made.“We rented for 12 months in a gorgeous flat in the centre of town: something that was never an option for us in London. As we’re both freelance, we had a lot more flexibility about when and where we moved - but that comes at a cost. It took us some time to build our work back up and our yearly earnings certainly took a dip for a while. But we didn’t really notice to be honest - our rent was half what we paid in London, we walked or cycled everywhere. It was fantastic. I think we were both amazed by how pent up and anxious we’d been in London - something we only noticed in it’s absence once we’d left. It genuinely felt like a weight had been lifted from us. We’ve been here two years now - we’ve bought a three bed house in a great neighbourhood, a house and an area that would never have been an option for us in London. One piece of advice I would give to anyone who decides to leave. Throw all of yourself into the move. Give your new home a chance to grab hold of you the way that London did when you first moved there.” Lee, 32, freelance musician, moved to Bristol when he was 30“In my opinion London is the best city in the world. We left London in September 2017 (at the age of 31) after both living in London since 2009 (when we were both 23). Having met in London, we both lived in various locations in and around Hackney. We now live in Shrewsbury in Shropshire and we love it! We had lived there since 2009 and had planned our move for about a year. Our main reason for wanting to leave was down to affordability. We couldn’t afford to buy a home, and we were spending astronomical amounts on rent each month. We also didn’t want to settle there long-term, so decided to move to Shrewsbury in order to get on the property ladder, and settle down somewhere closer to our families.“Living outside London is great we are paying a fraction of the price on our house. We are able to save a lot more money, which means we’ve been able to have holidays to Thailand and Italy this year. We’re also closer geographically to our families so weekends seem to be a lot more relaxing, as we’re not escaping the city each weekend to visit people and the countryside - they’re all on our doorstep! Don’t get me wrong, we miss London a lot, but it’s nostalgia more than wanting to still be living there now. We’re lucky that we still have friends there so we get the best of both worlds by being able to visit regularly.” Sophie and Andy, 32, working in marketing and operations respectively, moved to Shrewsbury when they were 31“Along with not feeling safe anymore, prices going up and poor air, there’s also the time spent commuting. You spend at least two hours a day travelling on packed public transport and get home so tired you don’t even want to move. Then all your energy has to be directed to your job, because you need to have a career path that’s always on the up, so you end up working more hours because you can’t afford to ‘lose the promotion’. We moved to Oxford and we’re enjoying it so far. The air is fresh and clean, we are amongst trees, squirrels and lawns, our flat comes with a garageand it takes eight minutes to reach the closest supermarket. Most things are within walking distance. I miss London’s delis and foodie places but the quality of everyday life isn’t comparable. Claudia, 34, restaurant manager, moved to Oxford when she was 33“My husband and I were lucky enough to have been able to buy a gorgeous little one and a half bed flat in Alexandra palace in 2009, but once we had our son, and wanted more children, we knew we had to either stay squeezed into where we are or move. My husband had to leave his job so that we could move but our flat in London had doubled in value and we were able to get a mortgage for a beautiful four bedroom house with the most stunning views. “The sombre part of the story is that we had a daughter who has a serious genetic condition meaning that she is seriously disabled and needs full-time care. Luckily, thanks to our move, we have enough space for all her equipment and having got the mortgage on my salary have been able to remain here with my husband not working. Our flat would have been unsuitable for a disabled child, and with one of us not able to work we would not have been able to afford the mortgage. I dread to think what would have happened but an awful situation would have been made so much worse. We love it here and would not move back.Some of my oldest friends are in London and I miss them but they come and stay, and are slowly also all leaving London as they just can’t afford it.” Gabriella, 33, NHS worker, moved to Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire when she was 30“I was born and raised in London but the idea of living in the capital has lost its appeal due to a number of factors. These include the high rent and living costs, air pollution and in some areas land pollution, particularly in crowded or less affluent areas. In addition, London has become a city that is detrimental to upholding good mental hygiene, based on these factors.. My husband and I, along with a kind gift from family, managed to put together a small amount of money for a deposit, but only for a property outside London. “We now live in a small two-bedroom house with a garden in Hertfordshire. Apart from the financial benefit we now know our neighbours, get involved in our community and we finally have a dog which we’ve always wanted. Our experience has been incredibly positive. The air feels fresher and I’ve noticed I don’t have as many sneezing fits, which I attribute to pollution. We have more space to live in, to enjoy our married life with our dog and hopefully with children in the not too distant future without worrying about moving because the landlord has decided to sell, increase rent, or simply because no children or pets are allowed. Moving outside of London has given us the opportunity to just simply live.” Tina, medical writer, moved to Hertfordshire when she was 29“I lived in London for nine years and absolutely loved it. My boyfriend (now husband) lived in Northamptonshire and we spent five years trailing up and down from London at weekends. I moved out to be with him and spent the money I had been spending on rent on my season ticket for the train, whilst my boyfriend paid the mortgage on our four bedroom cottage. I didn’t feel ready to leave London when I did - it was for practical reasons. However once I made the leap I realised that life outside London can be so much richer. “One of the first things that hit me was living in a real community. All the areas of London I’d lived in seemed so segregated. I suddenly had elderly neighbours, families living nearby, a council estate and very large houses all within a small area. It wasn’t until I went on maternity leave in 2016 that I felt part of the area for the first time. But then I felt isolated from the community again when I didn’t get home until at least 8pm. I’ve now found a job more locally and although I’ve taken a £7k pay cut I end up financially better off because of the cost of commuting. Plus I’ve gained two-to-three hours a day of free time.” Elizabeth, 35, charity fundraiser, moved to Northamptonshire when she was 31“I am a Londoner, born and bred. I still love the city however I wanted more space, less stress, better weather and no Brexit: Ibiza is perfect. My wife and I had been planning the move for several years as we were both keen to have a different lifestyle. The weather was a big driving factor but Brexit was definitely the final straw. We both feel that the situation is a serious detriment to the city and the country as a whole and we’re glad to have left this behind. The move so far has been amazing - even better than expected. Ibiza is a beautiful place to live and there is so much natural beauty here. There are around 300 days of sunshine a year, more than 40 great beaches and vast countryside. It’s only been a few months but so far (and to my surprise) we’ve not missed London at all.” Oli, 38, project manager, moved to Ibiza in April 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"alize cornet penalty shirt removal us open tennis heat","story":"Like many people getting ready for work in a hurry, the French -tennis player Alizé Cornet mistakenly put her top on back-to-front.The 28-year-old quickly realised her error after returning from a 10-minute heat break during a match at the US Open in New York, where players have been -sizzling in temperatures of up to 35 degrees.What she didn’t expect was that by walking to the back of the court and swiftly switching the pink-striped top the right way round, briefly flashing a black and red sports bra, tennis would be plunged into a new sexism row.According to an interpretation of the rules, female players are not allowed to remove their shirts on court, despite the fact their male counterparts do so freely. The chair umpire presiding over the match wasted no time issuing the world No 31 with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. Cornet’s facial expression suggested she was confused and angered by Christian Rask’s decision but he was unmoved.The whole episode lasted less than 10 seconds but is another heavy blow to the image of a sport that seems to tie itself in knots when it comes to the treatment of women players.The timing of the row is uncomfortable for the tennis authorities. It is not even the first time this week that the attire of women players has been in the spotlight. The French Open has just announced new “wardrobe rules” with an effective ban on the “black panther” catsuit Serena -Williams wore at this year’s tournament.The 36-year-old, who was making a comeback at Roland Garros after her daughter’s birth, wore a tutu on court in New York yesterday in an apparent comment on the French decision.Cornet went on to lose the first-round match against Johanna -Larsson of Sweden 6-4, 3-6, 2-6 but the debate around double standards it has prompted is likely to linger far longer in the collective memory of sport fans.The Women’s Tennis Association, which runs women’s tennis, eventually ruled the code violation was given in error while the US Tennis Association, in charge of the US Open, expressed “regret” at the decision.Prominent figures in tennis rushed to highlight an apparent gender ide in how the rules are applied.Rafael Nadal, the men’s world No 1, has a habit of removing his shirt at the end of every match because he sweated so much and felt that taking it off would prevent him from developing a cold. Novak Djokovic and other male players took their shirts off between games on Tuesday in New York to cool themselves with ice and towels in the sweltering conditions.The “heat rule” was in effect during Cornet’s match meaning players were allowed to take a break to cool off and rehydrate after the second set, while men could take a break after the third set. It was at this point that she put her shirt back on the wrong way round.Judy Murray, an outspoken advocate of women in tennis and a former captain of Great Britain’s female Fed Cup team, criticised the decision on Twitter. The US player Bethanie Mattek-Sands called the decision “weak”, while Australia’s Casey Dellacqua said it was “ridiculous”.The former British player Annabel Croft, covering the tournament for Amazon Prime, said she would have done exactly the same thing as Cornet.The USTA issued a statement saying it “regrets” that a code violation was given and Cornet would face no further punishment.Cornet welcomed the US Open’s apology last night – then criticised the president of the French Tennis Federation for banning Williams’ catsuit.She said she was shocked by how much attention the incident had received and accepted it as simply a mistake by the umpire.She said: “I was surprised when I just changed T-shirt really quick and he gave me the code violation, I didn’t expect it, and I told him it was pretty weird. I think it’s very fair from them to apologise to me. I really appreciate it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6594fc0d0ae222b243aa5caaf775d7b9c2787344/0_360_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebdc9bd7d1cf9da99c993b1534649b2b","title":"wayne barnes rugby referee retiring tmo","story":"The English referee begins his last full Premiership season at Exeter this weekend, wishing there was more TMO assistanceThe start of a new rugby union season is not just about players and coaches. Rarely have top-level referees been under more scrutiny, increasingly caught between a congested ruck and a hard place. Decisions in the modern game grow more hairline, the demands on its leading officials more intense. Without a capable whistle-blower to make sense of it all, the road to hell can be rapid.How blessed the sport has been to attract iniduals of the calibre of Wayne Barnes and Nigel Owens, experienced officials who can not only recite the lawbook but possess the all-important empathy to match. The better players visibly appreciate it, even when decisions go against them. Following New Zealand’s big win over Australia at Eden Park last Saturday, the first person to congratulate Barnes and ask after his family was David Pocock, the beaten Wallaby openside.Barnes was also deservedly praised by several Kiwi sages, more than a little ironic given the virulent criticism he endured in the aftermath of the All Blacks’ 2007 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Cardiff. These days the Englishman cuts a far more assured figure, which makes it even more bittersweet that he is preparing to hand in his sheriff’s badge and walk away at the height of his whistling powers.Over a coffee in Twickenham this week, barely 24 hours after flying back from Auckland, the 39-year‑old Barnes reveals several factors have prompted his decision. Next year, selection permitting, will be his fourth Rugby World Cup he has a growing young family and his wife, Polly, has just had a work promotion. He also wants to give more time to his “other” job, as a barrister specialising in bribery and corruption at a London chambers, a far cry from his teenage holiday job crushing berries in a Ribena factory – “It was a plum job!” – in his native Forest of Dean. After 200 Premiership games and 81 Test matches, the temptation to bow out at the top is understandable.As it stands that means this Saturday’s game between Exeter and Leicester will in effect mark the start of his last full Premiership campaign, with RWC 2019 in Japan earmarked as his international swansong. Given Owens is still going strong at 47, it represents a regrettably early bath for an influential figure who has steadily earned a global respect afforded to few English officials. The great Ed Morrison presided over the 1995 World Cup final should England fail to reach Yokohama next November, there must be a fair chance of Barnes doing likewise.Before that, though, looms a hugely significant season for the English game. Barnes, who refereed his first Premiership game in 2005, has had a ringside season ticket as concussion fears, tackle height anxiety and breakdown collisions have all intensified. “I wouldn’t say I’m concerned but it’s something we all need to be aware of. It’s ferocious and extremely physical. I think players are aware they’ve got to take a bit more responsibility. If it goes wrong you’re going to hit someone in the head and probably face a red card and a ban.”In Barnes’s view it would also be helpful to have more, rather than less, input from the television match official up in the stand. “I would expand it so we can check whatever we want without necessarily stopping the game. If, in a crucial moment, I can ask: ‘Is that a forward pass?’ and someone can tell me the answer in three seconds we don’t need to stop the game for 30-40 seconds. It’s like a scrum-half constantly talking to his No 10.” If such support had been on tap in 2007, it would certainly have saved him a world of angst.The latest RFU crackdown on players appealing to officials and waving imaginary cards also has Barnes’s firm support, even though it feels half a lifetime since he sent off Dylan Hartley, now England’s captain, for swearing in the 2013 Premiership final. “It’s not a subject we discuss a lot. It wouldn’t be our general chit chat. I just don’t think it would happen again. Dylan’s a superb leader … I think it was just a moment of frustration.“It was a massive shame it became the talking point. Pocock shouted at me at the weekend about something I’d got wrong but I had to remind him there are better ways of doing that. He said: ‘Of course, sorry, that wasn’t the right way.’”Yet when he does “hand over my rusty whistle”, Barnes will depart with far more happy memories than regrets. Last season’s European Champions’ Cup final, a horribly tough game between Leinster and Racing 92, was an unenviable assignment and Barnes returned to the sanctuary of his dressing room not anticipating much post-match bonhomie. Within seconds Racing’s Irish lock Donnacha Ryan had stuck his head around the door and invited him to share a beer or two. Barely had they blown the froth off the first when there was another loud knock. Enter Leinster’s Tadhg Furlong, bearing a further stack of beers for the Englishman and his assistants.There was another revealing snapshot following Saracens’ win over Exeter at Twickenham last May when Barnes sent Schalk Brits to the sin-bin on his farewell club appearance. Afterwards the hooker was given his yellow card to keep, inscribed with the message: “Dear Schalk, Sorry, Wayne.” English rugby should celebrate the unassuming Mr Barnes – Sir to you – while it still can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/039ecb1a2954117ad18e980e21e39f1c1cd62038/67_0_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3a929c941eb54d040ccde092dfad0d2","title":"england batsmen nail places sri lanka india fourth test","story":"One up with two to play makes you the favourite to win. Yet on the eve of the fourth Test in Southampton the India team, though 2-1 down in the series, seem the more settled. For the first time in Virat Kohli’s reign as\u0026nbspcaptain he has indicated he intends to play the same side in consecutive Tests. Meanwhile England, despite their lead, remain a team in a state of flux.This may not be desirable but it is not necessarily a bad thing. The blunt truth is no one can be sure whether they have the right personnel in the England team, how long they should persist with batsmen, young and old, who are not producing the goods and then there is still scope to debate what\u0026nbspconstitutes their best bowling attack. There is no disgrace in being a team in flux. The situation would be worse if the selectors rigidly stuck to the same names come what may, instead of searching and experimenting. But some solutions soon would be handy.The instability of the team is illustrated by the realisation that for the Test tour to Sri Lanka in October the selectors can surely ink in only one specialist batsman, Joe Root. Consider the others. Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings need runs to justify being certainties for the trip. Cook has one half-century in his past 14 Test innings Jennings has one half-century in his past 15 and a Test average of 23 after 10 matches. James Vince and Ollie Pope, both of whom were omitted from the final XI for the fourth Test, are easy on the eye until we peruse their records, though one should immediately add the caveat that Pope has played only three Test innings. Jonny Bairstow? He is a certainty for Sri Lanka but while he is playing at the Ageas Bowl as a batsman only he cannot really be regarded as a specialist, such is his determination to keep keeping\u0026nbspwicket.So it is Root plus four AN Others as the selectors contemplate their specialist batsmen for the winter. At Southampton there is at least the chance for two of them, the openers, to nail down a spot, which adds a spicy subplot to a Test that already has obvious importance since it could decide the\u0026nbspseries.Even the bankers in the top half of the order have something to prove. Bairstow has explained in forthright terms his eagerness to remain the wicketkeeper and he is entitled to do that, just as he is obliged to play as a specialist batsman if that is what the captain and coach want. How will he feel if he excels in his new role in this match, thereby providing evidence he can function so well as a specialist\u0026nbspbatsman?Then there is Ben Stokes in the middle order. He seems to be a different player now he no longer swashbuckles. Since his return to the side after the Ashes, Stokes has made two half-centuries in 10 innings, 66 in Auckland in April, 62 at Trent Bridge last week. In those innings his strike rate has been 35 and 33 respectively. In part this is a sign of increased responsibility on Stokes’s part given that in both those matches England were on the rack after dire first-innings performances with the bat.It may be Stokes has merely been restrained by the frailties of the top order, which have forced him to dig in but 12 months ago the great asset of Stokes the batsman was not as a dogged occupier of the crease. It would be reassuring to see him dominate an attack again and it would be helpful if the top order gave him the freedom to play that way – if he can.As usual all the pre-series talk of rotation among the bowlers has evaporated. Stuff happens: Stokes goes to court Woakes goes in the thigh so the team adjust accordingly and the old lags must keep going – at least until the series is decided. For this Test, the idea of playing Moeen Ali is a good one simply because he has been in such good form. He is a streaky cricketer, a dangerous opponent at his best, and England are right to try to cash in appropriately, even though that means omitting Pope.Meanwhile the India camp seems remarkably tranquil.

He apologised for the remark last month after Unsworth threatened to sue, Tesla shares ed and the company’s investors issued an open letter demanding Musk apologise.“Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?” he wrote in subsequent tweets that are still online.Musk made the new comments despite reportedly receiving a letter from Unsworth’s lawyers earlier this month notifying him that they were preparing a civil complaint for “false and defamatory” statements by the entrepreneur.“You published through three different tweets to your 22 million followers that Mr Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of 12 Thai children,” Unsworth’s lawyer, L Lin Wood wrote, according to BuzzFeed News.“You did so without any basis. According to a subsequent Twitter post, you did so out of anger.”Unsworth told Sky News on Wednesday that he could not comment on Musk’s latest tweets, but added: “It’s all being dealt with, that’s all I can say.”Musk has been under pressure from Telsa investors over his erratic behaviour on social media. His return to Twitter, just days after he abandoned a plan to take Tesla private, is likely to renew concerns about the entrepreneur’s impulsiveness.He told the New York Times this month the past year had been “excruciating” and the “most difficult and painful” of his career, claiming he had been working up to 120 hours a week and neglecting his health and family.While the latest communiques avoided any reference to the troubled car company, his 7 August “funding secured” tweet signalled he had raised billions needed to take Tesla private at $420 a share.The episode, known since as the “Tesla tweet”, alerted the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which intensified a pre-existing investigation into the firm’s public pronouncements on vehicle production forecasts, and triggered two class-action investor lawsuits.Lawyers have warned the tweet may have broken a law that bans public companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives do not intend or do not have the means to complete the deal, or if they are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the aftermath of the 7 August tweet, several Tesla board members have reportedly tried to convince Musk to refrain from using Twitter. James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, an asset management firm with a substantial stake in Tesla, told the New York Times this week that he still had faith in the 47-year-old chief executive.Contacted by BuzzFeed, Musk did not acknowledge a letter from the er’s lawyers dated 6 August and detailing a potential lawsuit for the “false and defamatory statements”.Musk reportedly told BuzzFeed: “Have you actually done any research at all? For example, you incorrectly state that he is a er, which shows that you know essentially nothing and have not even bothered to research basic facts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d219509200af4b55aec1c933814c8e8f734b3b5/0_0_4134_2479/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087cde0b26225098960e0719fb6dac3f","title":"horizon week without lying review social experiment honesty","story":"How often do you lie? Go on, tell the truth. Only to be kind to others? Lying by omission doesn’t count? Your carefully curated Instagram feed isn’t a form of deception – it’s just that applying the Clarendon filter to photos of you holding a smoothie makes you feel good.It is estimated that we lie up to nine times a day, which makes me wonder what on earth the rate must be for world leaders. Apparently, we start lying at the age of one, when we learn to cry for attention, although my 12-month-old does this and I call it communicating her needs (and adorable, naturally). The question is whether we could or, indeed, would want to stop doing something as integral to human nature as laughing, feeling disappointed or watching silly BBC documentaries posing as serious telly.The premise of this one – Horizon: A Week Without Lying: The Honesty Experiment (BBC Two) – is whether it is possible to create a world in which we cannot lie. In a social experiment touted as a global first, three British subjects are hooked up to state-of-the-art lie-detecting technology and challenged by European scientists to go a week without lying. Obviously, it is destined to fail, as we all pretend not to know detoxes, diets and any other form of denial lead to telling porkies.Mo is a 37-year-old advertising consultant, a job some might say is built on lies (although she calls it “positioning”). When she was younger, she kept a lot from her traditional Indian parents, including her sexuality, so she has an understandably complicated relationship with telling the truth. Ruth, 46, is a parish priest in Leeds who has a habit of lying by omission. “If it’s a choice between truth and love,” she says, “I always want to go with love.” She later tells her husband that if she always told him what she thought they would get a orce. Ouch. And Ehiz, a 19-year-old student and YouTuber, is the most self-deceiving of them all. Of course he is: he’s a teenager.All three are fitted with wrist sensors to detect changes in heart rate and sweat, and accelerometers to monitor movements, because lying increases the cognitive load on our brains and makes us inhabit our bodies differently. Finally, their language and verbal cues will be analysed. They are asked to ulge the last lie they told, ranging from a sneaky cigarette to a refusal to admit to eating a sibling’s pancakes, then they are monitored while telling a fake lie. Later, they are sent out into the world with the instruction to just be themselves. Or rather their best false selves.And so they lie. Mo tells her partner, Sophia, she wants to go to Brighton when she would clearly rather boil her own head. At work, a client asks if she finds them frustrating. “Not at all,” Mo protests, while her body freezes and her heart rate goes all zig-zaggy. Ruth has coffee with her parishioners and reassures one that his prayers were “fine”, “very clear” and “followed the brief” – while shaking her head. Oh dear. You don’t need a truth-watch to deduce that she is not being honest. But what would have been achieved by telling him his prayers were crap?Ehiz is the most problematic case: young, defensive and fragile. All front and insecurity, he was bullied at school and I am not sure he is an appropriate person for the experiment. At times, it makes for uncomfortable viewing, like when he brags at length about networking at a meeting while the other members regard him silently, with cynical expressions. “In the end, you’re just building a lively conversation,” he says chirpily afterwards. You have to ask: what is the point of all this?During the second half of the experiment, the three are instructed to stop lying for a week. Ehiz disappears for four days. When he resurfaces he sends a video of himself in bed, off sick with depression. Mo breaks down in tears. “I don’t think I’ve been fully honest yet,” she admits. “I’m getting upset. It’s quite deep.” Unfortunately, neither the programme nor the experiment can address this depth of psychological complexity. If deception is a fundamental part of being human, the focus shouldn’t be on whether we can stop lying. The issues of why we lie, who it serves, how deeply it is embedded in our sense of selves and our increasingly precarious relationship with the truth cannot be solved with sensors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2db4f1edd7de4cb52cc52971ffd4076e591a3f/282_233_3089_1853/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adeca5df6f43d51e95df30cb0e2bfbcd","title":"australia may ban chelsea manning from entering country","story":"‘We’ll work it out,’ says whistleblower, as tour organiser asks supporters to lobby immigration ministerUS whistleblower Chelsea Manning has expressed confidence the Australian government will allow her to enter the country for a speaking tour, despite indications that it is considering barring her.In her first public comment on the controversy, Manning told  Australia “we’ll work it out” as the organisers of her tour begin to lobby the government not to follow through on the ban.Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the US army who served in the Iraq war, spent seven years in a military prison after being convicted of leaking nearly 750,000 classified military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks.Barack Obama commuted her original 35-year-sentence, and she was released in May 2017.Manning, an occasional  columnist, is scheduled to give a speech at the Sydney Opera House on Sunday night as part of the Antidote festival, as well as addresses in Brisbane and Melbourne.The Australian organiser of her speaking tour, Think Inc, has written to supporters asking them to lobby the newly installed immigration minister, David Coleman.“We have just received a notice of intention to consider refusal under s501 of the Migration Act from the Australian government in regards to Chelsea’s visa,” the company’s director, Suzi Jamil, wrote to supporters.“We are looking for support from relevant national bodies or iniduals, especially politicians who can support Chelsea’s entry into Australia. We are seeking letters of support to send to the minister for immigration in order for him to reconsider his decision.”Jamil told  Australia organisers were “positive” about the prospect of convincing the minister to allow Manning in, citing a “groundswell of support” for her and arguing she is coming to speak on privacy and transgender issues and will abide by Australia’s laws.Jamil said Manning had received letters of support from the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, the Human Rights Law Centre, Digital Rights Watch, the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Castan Centre for Human Rights. The prime minister, Scott Morrison – himself a former immigration minister – said on Thursday he would discuss it with Coleman but it was “actually not my specific responsibility” but rather a personal power of the minister.Section 501 of the Australian Migration Act gives the immigration minister broad and unchallengeable powers to refuse or cancel visas, either on national interest grounds or because they decide applicants or holders have not passed a “character test”. The former immigration minister Peter Dutton, who is now home affairs minister, used the provision regularly to cancel the visas of bike gang members, people with criminal records and others.The rappers Snoop Dogg and Chris Brown, the “pickup artist” Jeff Allen and the boxer Floyd Mayweather have all been denied visas on character grounds. The Holocaust denier David Irving has been refused a visa various times.A spokeswoman for the department of home affairs, which oversees immigration, said it would not comment on inidual cases, but that all non-citizens entering Australia must meet the character requirements of the Migration Act.“A person can fail the character test for a number of reasons, including but not limited to where a non-citizen has a substantial criminal record or where their conduct represents a risk to the Australian community.”On Thursday the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, called on the government to explain why it was considering blocking Manning, who she described as a “very high profile figure” and “controversial”.Wong used the controversy to criticise Dutton’s decision to exercise discretion to allow several au pairs tourist visas despite evidence they had come to work in Australia. She told Radio National Manning’s treatment was “inconsistent” compared with “the ease with which” the au pairs were allowed to enter Australia.Manning is due to speak in New Zealand the weekend after her first Australian address, but the opposition there has also called for her to be blacklisted.Because of her previous convictions, Manning requires a special direction visa to visit New Zealand, and is subject to additional character provisions in the country’s Immigration Act.New Zealand’s opposition immigration spokesman, Michael Woodhouse, said Manning’s special direction visa should be refused because of her history of criminal convictions.“This is a convicted felon, sentenced to 35 years in jail, coming in here for money,” Woodhouse told Stuff. “There’s no rehabilitation, no remorse, the very purpose of her visit to come and talk about her crimes.”Immigration New Zealand said “an appropriately delegated INZ staff member will look at the representations in the first instance”, confirming they had received an application from Manning’s representatives for a visa.Manning tweeted last year that she had been banned from entering Canada because of her criminal convictions, but then secured a Canadian visa in May this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71287e949c9bd6ae4323bf4b08f48766421516f0/0_85_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe9a0303e96f6e965bcf995c47e5ff29","title":"california electricity fossil fuels wind solar vote","story":"California ridding itself entirely of carbon-intensive energy has been a politically vexed proposition for the past two years, with state Republicans arguing it was unfeasible and would drive up electricity prices.But the state has emerged as a bastion of defiance to the Trump administration on climate change, among other issues, as it has been scorched by record wildfires and a prolonged drought.

At around 5:30am on Wednesday, however, a deluge of water burst out of the dam, inundating acres of rice fields and causing a bridge on a highway connecting Yangon and Mandalay, Myanmar’s biggest cities, to buckle.“The damage is not bad, but the bridge is unusable because the water is still receding,” said Aung Zaw Htay, an official from the Myanmar Fire Services Department.Authorities have not yet released any casualty figures.The Swar Chaung dam was built around 2001, according to Kyaw Myint Hlaing, the director-general of Myanmar’s irrigation department. He said the cause of the breach had not yet been identified, but he ruled out a flaw in the dam’s design.“The design of the dam’s spillway is like the beak of a duck. One of the ‘beaks’ broke, but the dam itself has not broken. This is related to the monsoon, but also related to unknown factors,” he said.“We are trying our best to find a temporary solution to stop the remaining water behind the dam from overflowing,” he said.The breach occurred after a series of earlier floods in southern and central Myanmar in late July, during which the authorities only instructed many residents to evacuate after their homes were already under several feet of water.About 150,000 people were displaced, many of whom have become reliant on private food donations after their crops were destroyed. Residents of one flooded village in Bago region said authorities had only provided aid to pregnant women and mothers of children under six months old.A hydroelectric dam in southern Laos collapsed in July, killing at least 27 people and displacing thousands. When asked if the Swar Chaung failure resembled the Laos disaster, Kyaw Myint said: “I’m not familiar with the dam in Laos.”Officials said the plains below the dam were still flooded on Wednesday evening, but that the water covering the highway was slowly receding. Aung Zaw Htay, the fire department official, said his team’s priority was to clear the area in order to return the roads to working condition. As in earlier floods, Myanmar authorities have placed much of the responsibility to avoid danger on the victims. The fire department officialsaid that by the time his team arrived“the residents were already evacuating themselves”.“The villagers have had experiences dealing with it, so there wasn’t much trouble. The villagers who live around here know about the possibility of flooding,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611614.1535564187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of cervical smears unread as screening delays worsen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRevelations prompted by the case taken by Vicky Phelan (above) in April have led to a surge in women seeking repeat cervical smears, and growing delays in processing tests. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe Hundreds of smear tests performed on women in the CervicalCheck screening programme could not be read this year due to delays in processing them, new figures show.The sharp rise in expired samples is linked to a surge in women seeking repeat smears following controversy over the programme since Vicky Phelan settled her court case last April.Ms Phelan, a mother-of-two from Co Limerick, settled a High Court action against a US laboratory for €2.5 million over a 2011 smear test, which wrongly gave a negative result for cancer. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test only in September 2017.New figures show that in the aftermath of this controversy, the number of smears performed in CervicalCheck jumped by more than 50 per cent between July 2017 and July 2018.In July this year, more than 27,200 smears were taken via the programme, compared to 18,700 in the same month in 2017.The Government reached a deal with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) in May facilitating repeat smears for women concerned about their cervical health.Due to the rise in patients undergoing smear tests, the backlog in receiving test results has doubled, going from six-eight weeks to up to 13 weeks in some cases.These delays are likely to persist until the new year, the IMO has told its GP members.The data compiled by CervicalCheck on August 22nd reveals that 110 smear tests taken in July 2018 could not be read, as the samples had expired, a four-fold rise compared to the 27 expired samples recorded in July 2017.Of the 110 tests, 87 had expired because they were not processed by a laboratory in a timely fashion. The remainder were expired vials from GPs.Samples expire when they are not processed within six weeks by the laboratory, while the vials expire in cases where GPs failed to send smear tests to the laboratory quickly enough.Between April and July this year, 330 samples and vials expired compared to 242 in 2017, representing a rise of 36 per cent.The HSE said women and GPs are always informed if a screening sample or vial has expired.Patients must leave a minimum of a three-month gap between smears.Since July 30th this year, a new system is in place in CervicalCheck whereby all samples are transferred to slides to prevent tests from expiring. The slide might not be read for quite some time, but once the sample is on a slide it cannot expire.The new system aims to dramatically reduce the number of expired samples in the future and to ensure confidence in the programme.Any repeat smears required by patients over 25 years of age whose original tests cannot be read will be paid for.Correspondence from the IMO to its members earlier this week states: “CervicalCheck are working towards having a restoration of normal reporting times as soon as is feasible but this is likely to be into the new year.“The agreement with the State on repeat smears and consultations remains in place until 31 December 2018. The agreed consultation rate is €50 and the repeat smear is paid at the normal rate of €49.10.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ireland faces huge challenges to meet binding 2020 EU targets, says MinisterRise in expired smears follows controversy over CervicalCheck since Vicky Phelan caseAim is to encourage \u0026lsquogreat communication\u0026rsquo from researchers tackling global challengesOpposition outcry as An Post announces 159 closures, with west of Ireland hardest hitEvent marks 30th anniversary of UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeIsland\u0026rsquos 150-year-old national school still searching for second teacherStructural engineers assessing whether Bank Buildings can be savedPaschal Donohoe highlights \u0026lsquothree-year wage agreement\u0026rsquoThe National Lottery reveals there is one winner for Wednesday\u0026rsquos top prizeSpeaking at his general audience in the Vatican, pontiff says meeting surviors left \u0026lsquoprofound mark\u0026rsquoFeminist campaigners label the new street facilities sexist and discriminatory\u0026lsquoThe upheavals of recent years have tested the traditionally strong faith of the Irish people\u0026rsquoLinkedIn page saying woman worked for 12\u0026frac12 years at Supermac\u0026rsquos deleted after questions\u0026lsquoAll of the politicians, who claim to be for public housing . . . should be here\u0026rsquoMore than half of 83,000 provisional drivers on list have yet to be given an appointmentLocals in Lemybrien, Kilmeaden and Swanlinbar feel the loss of their local branchPull all information together for \u0026lsquointelligence picture\u0026rsquo, Grahame White tells financial sector1960s concrete tower to be clad in metal meshSecond round offers see significant fall in points for some courses in Dublin and CorkDepartment of Education insists there is a school place for any child who needs it"},{"url":null,"title":"sorrys and selfies the highs and lows of the pope s ireland visit","story":"  August 27, 2018Hugely anticipated visit of Pope Francis to Ireland did not attract the expected numbers   August 28, 2018Rite\u0026ampReason: Parishes are shifting as communal force and should be bedrock of lay-led identity   August 28, 2018Opinion poll shows just one in three think pope\u0026rsquos comments sufficient   August 29, 2018This was the pope\u0026rsquos first speech on his arrival in Ireland on Saturday, August 25th, 2018 "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611769.1535573313!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman who objected to rival fast food outlet works for supermac s","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupermac’s outlet on Eyre Square, Galway city. File photograph: Google Street ViewA woman who wrote a letter objecting to a planned fast food outlet at Eyre Square in Galway city which would compete with a nearby Supermac’s is a long-standing employee of the company and a former personal assistant to its founder, Pat McDonagh.The woman, Aisling O’Doherty, who referred to herself in her September 3rd, 2012 letter to Galway City Council planning department as “a resident at No 24 Eyre Square Townhouses”, has been working for Supermac’s for more than 12 years and is married to a senior member of its management team.Contacted yesterday by The , a woman who answered Ms O’Doherty’s phone did not say whether she was Ms O’Doherty but said she would pass a message to Ms O’Doherty.Ms O’Doherty did not return the call but at about the same time, her LinkedIn business profile was deleted.In it, Ms O’Doherty had identified her current employment as working at “purchasing” for Supermac’s for the past 12½ years.Also, according to the deleted LinkedIn profile, from April 2006 to February 2009, Ms O’Doherty said she was simultaneously PA (personal assistant) to Supermac’s chief executive, Mr McDonagh.Questions submitted to Pat McDonagh’s public relations manager, who also works for Supermac’s, by email and text, including a follow-up phone call and voicemail message, were not answered.Ms O’Doherty is a long-time resident of Loughrea, Co Galway.The address in her 2012 letter, objecting to planning permission being given to Hillbillys, a fast food outlet sought for No 30 Eyre Square, is a townhouse.The townhouse property is owned by Mr McDonagh, as are several other dwellings in the development.A private investigator working for Hillbillys restaurant investigated Ms O’Doherty’s claim to reside at 24 Eyre Square Townhouses in February 2013. They reported calling there and being met by a Tony O’Brien who said “Aisling O’Doherty was not living at the address and that he has been living there since September 2012”.Interest in the HilbillysSupermac’s planning dispute (the rival restaurant eventually won planning permission but the site is now occupied by a branch of the Caffè Nero group) comes in the wake of controversy over forged letters of support allegedly written to back Mr McDonagh’s plans for a large-scale motorway service area off the M18 near Ennis in Co Clare and submitted for his planning application.Mr McDonagh has said he had nothing to do with the Ennis letters, which came mostly from the Clarecastle area, and had denounced the forging of signatures as “illegal”. He has admitted, however, that Supermac’s agreed to pay the €20 submission fee for each of some 180 letters.They were delivered in bulk to the council offices by Howard Williams, an environmental consultant retained by Mr McDonagh in support of the Ennis planning application.In response to recent disclosures about the Ennis letters, objectors to the motorway service area plan, which include long-established town-centre hotels and retail outlets, have raised the spectre of the application being subjected to judicial review.In a letter to the council’s senior planner Brian McCarthy, P Coleman \u0026amp Associates, planning consultants for the objectors, ask whether the council was satisfied that letters that have not been withdrawn, and therefore remain to be considered with the application, are in fact valid.“Our clients are seeking to ensure that the planning authority are fully satisfied that the planning process associated with this planning application has not been compromised in any way,” says the letter.“In particular,” it continues, “our clients are seeking to ensure that the planning authority are fully satisfied that the letters of support for the proposed development which have not been formally withdrawn and which remain on the planning file are valid letters of support from bona fide supporters with their correct names and addresses.”Twenty-two of the alleged declarations of support for Mr McDonagh’s plan have now been withdrawn, suggesting up to 150 remain as submitted – both genuine correspondence and fake.The Coleman letter concludes that “if this application is ever subject to a judicial review that the planning application process would not be deemed to have been compromised in any way”.The Ennis planning application is due to be decided by the council on September 4th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611289.1535570439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government constitutionally bound to hold presidential inauguration on armistice day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Under current plans the date of the inauguration on November 11th clashes with the centenary anniversary of Armistice Day, the ending of World War One.   Photograph: Frank Miller The Government has said it is constitutionally bound to hold the Presidential inauguration on the centenary of the Armistice. On Tuesday, Minister for the Environment Eoghan Murphy announced the Presidential election will be held by October 26th and the inauguration on November 11th, 100 years to the day after the end of the first World War. A spokesman for Leo Varadkar said the Taoiseach is committed to marking the Armistice having becoming the first holder of the office to wear a poppy as he did in the Dáil last year. However, he said it was a constitutional imperative to inaugurate the president first. “To have the President at the commemoration, we need to have an inauguration first,” he said. “It is something the Taoiseach has been particularly mindful of in embracing all traditions on this island. Absolutely, the Armistice will be marked.” The spokesman pointed to the provision in the Constitution which states: “Every subsequent President shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor.” President Higgins’ term of office expires at midnight on November 10th.Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin has called for the date of inauguration to be put back. The Minister for Health Simon Harris on Wednesday said the Government will reflect on the timing of the inauguration and it wished to ensure that “Ireland continues to commemorate and recognise the participation of Irish iniduals in world wars”.“I think as a country we have shown a maturity in relation to this in recent years which is very welcome in commemorating a whole range of events in a sensitive manner.” More Irishmen fought and died in the first World War than in any other conflict. According to the historian Tom Burnell, 29,450 who died were from what is now the Republic of Ireland, suggesting a figure of 45,000 for the whole island. Some 270,000 Irishmen and women served in either the British armed force or those of the Commonwealth or American armies. A spokesman for Mr Murphy said the Government had no discretion in setting the date for the inauguration. “It is not a date at all. It is a constitutional matter. If we moved the inauguration, it would mean that we would have no President on Armistice Day,” he said.He pointed out that President Higgins was inaugurated on November 11th, 2011. His predecessor Mary McAleese was also inaugurated in both 1997 and 2004 on Armistice Day. Mr Murphy’s spokesman said the inauguration and the marking of the centenary of the Armistice were “not mutually exclusive” events and a morning inauguration will give the newly-elected President, whoever he or she might be, time to take part in the Armistice commemorations. NUIG law professor Tom O’Malley said he agreed with the Government.“I think the Government is probably right and if the inauguration was left until after November 11th then there would be a vacancy and I’m not sure that is provided for by the Constitution,” he said. He said while there was a line in the Constitution that says a new president has to be inaugurated on the day after a former president leaves office there is an additional clause which says “or as soon as may be thereafter”.He said that may give the Government “some wiggle room” but added that the “basic principle is there shouldn’t be any gap in the presidency if it is unnecessary so they are probably stuck with November 11th.” He said it could depend on how the word thereafter was interpreted but he expressed the view that “there should be continuity of the presidency”.DCU’s Dr Tom Hickey, who works in the fields of constitutional law and political theory, echoed the views of Mr O’Malley and while he said the language in the relevant clause of the Constitution might allow for a delay in an inauguration, such a move would be unlikely. The Armistice commemorations will be run by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. A spokesman for Minister Josepha Madigan said: “The Department is aware of the coincidence of dates and is working with relevant departments to consider appropriate options to commemorate Armistice Day.“The Government is mindful that November 11th marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War 1. The Taoiseach and other members of the Government have participated in Armistice Day commemorations in previous years and will give consideration as to how best to commemorate this significant anniversary.” The first World War ended at 11am on November 11th, 1918. Commemorations to mark the centenary will take place across the world on that date. Danny Boyle, the film director who choreographed the London Olympic opening ceremony, has been put in charge of marking the Armistice in Britain. It is expected that Queen Elizabeth II will mark the Armistice by inviting German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the ceremonies in London as a mark of reconciliation between the two countries."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611547.1535560761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how se%C3%A1n gallagher nearly became president of ireland in 2011","story":"Businessman Seán Gallagher has announced he is to seek a nomination to run in the presidential election in October. Video: Seán Gallagher\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Gallagher reacts as Martin McGuinness tackles him on the issue of a Fianna Fáil fundraiser. Photograph: RTÉSeán Gallagher almost became president in 2011 until his campaign imploded in the final days of the campaign. But what exactly happened?It had been, as everyone wearily attested, a bruising campaign. But the opinion polls on the final weekend all bore the same message: Gallagher was on course to be the next president of Ireland.The 49-year-old Cavan native, who described himself as an entrepreneur and community activist but was best known as a panellist on the TV programme Dragons’ Den, had come from nowhere to the brink of the country’s highest office.As the campaigns of better-known candidates like David Norris, Dana and Mary Davis had wilted under intense media scrutiny, or never really got going in the first place – as in the case of Gay Mitchell and Martin McGuinness – support for Gallagher had grown continuously.Now, with polling day just a few days away, his position appeared unassailable.The secret of Gallagher’s success was hard to fathom it is probably fair to say that he was nobody’s idea of a president before the campaign began.Someone more different than all the previous holders of the office, it would be hard to imagine. But in an Ireland that had been stunned by the economic crash and ravaged by the ensuing austerity, his blend of sunny optimism, plain speaking and relentless talk of recovery had struck a chord with people desperate for a signal towards a better future. He was, apparently, an outsider to the discredited political establishment.But he had the most indispensable quality of a successful politician – people liked him. He made them believe things could be better.How much of this was by design or accident is impossible to know now. But allied to a growing, if subterranean, realisation among Fianna Fáilers – until very recently the largest political organisation in the country, don’t forget – that he was essentially one of them, his rise in the polls had been relentless.With four days to go to polling, he was clear of the chasing pack – polls put him on 40 per cent, 38 per cent, 41 per cent and 40 per cent, will Michael D Higgins trailing in the mid to high 20s. Only a political earthquake could stop him now.“Seven people. One job. The final debate. What will happen here tonight will impact on voters’ decisions, so there’s clearly a lot at stake.”When the programme began a few minutes later, the candidates were offered an opening statement to set out their stalls for the presidency. Most of it had all been heard before.But McGuinness had prepared an attack on Gallagher which would change the course of the election.He went on to say that he had been contacted by a man who had attended a Fianna Fáil fundraiser in Dundalk in 2008 where he had paid €5,000 and had been given a photograph of himself with then taoiseach Brian Cowen.Gallagher had called round to his house to collect the cheque, he said. “The cronyism, the developers, the speculators and those who effectively destroyed the economy of this country, and Seán is up to his neck in all of that and he can’t deny it,” McGuinness said.Kenny turned to Gallagher.“You’re as thick as thieves with Fianna Fáil and you’re trying to deny it?”Haltingly, Gallagher explained his association with Fianna Fáil, painting a picture of largely peripheral involvement. He had been asked to invite “perhaps three or four” local businessmen to a fundraiser. He denied he had solicited or collected money.McGuinness repeated it. “I would caution you Seán, at this stage, that you are in very murky waters,” he warned.“I can tell you quite clearly,” Gallagher explained, “I invited perhaps two to three people to that event. At the event people were asked if they’d like a photograph, as is normal at these functions, and I personally delivered – if that’s the case I don’t remember it – delivering a photograph, but I can tell you . . . ”McGuinness interjected to say he had called to the man’s house to collect a cheque for €5,000.“That’s not correct,” Gallagher replied.McGuinness grinned broadly. “I have to say you’re in deep, deep trouble.”In fact, the story of the fund-raiser was not new. The previous week, the Irish Independent had reported that Gallagher has asked “business friends” to pay €5,000 to “dine with Cowen”. But now Gallagher was adding faces, names, photographs, cheques and envelopes to the story. And for the first time in the campaign, he looked rattled. Seriously rattled.Questions had also been circulated about some of Gallagher’s business dealings. Firms promised investment on Dragons’ Den did not receive the full amounts pledged on air. Gallagher had been paid huge amounts by companies which it turned out were struggling. Some of his companies had received significant State grants.Back on Frontline, an audience member raised specific questions about a cheque for €89,000 for one of these companies that had been misdirected to Gallagher’s personal account. It was a mistake, Gallagher said, and had later been rectified. But the hammer blow was yet to come.Returning after a commercial break, Kenny announced there had been “a development on the Martin McGuinness for President Twitter account. Sinn Féin are going to produce the man who gave you the cheque for five grand.”“You know who it is?” Kenny asked Gallagher.“Yes,” Gallagher said. He was a fuel-smuggler, a convicted criminal and someone with links to Sinn Féin. But he didn’t want to get involved in this. He was shouted down by the audience.Kenny asked, incredulously: “You went to a fuel-smuggler’s house and invited him to a Fianna Fáil do?”Gallagher was floundering now, trying to explain that he had been asked to invite local businessmen. “What I have done – I may well have delivered the photograph – if he gave me an envelope” – here the audience hooted again – “If he gave me the cheque , it was made out to Fianna Fáil headquarters, and it was delivered and that was that. It was nothing to do with me.”It was riveting television. Gallagher, the presidential frontrunner, was unravelling before the eyes of 900,000 viewers at a critical point in the campaign. But to RTÉ’s excruciating embarrassment, the tweet turned out to be from a fake account. But this was never acknowledged during the programme.In December 2017, after years of legal exchanges, RTÉ apologised in the High Court to Gallagher and paid him what he described as “substantial damages” for his treatment by the programme.A 2012 decision by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld Gallagher’s complaints that he had been treated unfairly. RTÉ also conducted its own review of the programme, which found that while Gallagher had been subjected to tough questioning, Higgins had not.But it was not just the tweet, or the Frontline programme that derailed Gallagher’s bid. The following morning, in a bid to rescue his campaign, he appeared on Pat Kenny’s radio show.Asked to address the question about his business dealings put to him by the audience member who described herself as a businesswoman, Gallagher testily replied: “Who is the businesswoman, what’s her background, and where does she come from, and what party is she attached to? I’m tired of people being wheeled out with agendas. You put that person here in front of me and let them tell you and me and the nation their background.”Later he demanded: “You don’t know why she was there or her political background . . . Is she on somebody else’s campaign team? Is she a member of a political party?”A few moments later, Gallagher got his answer. The woman, Glenna Lynch, rang the show. They put her straight on air.“I’m so shocked. I was driving on my way to see someone, a client in work and I had to stop the car. It’s absolutely shocking,” she said.Gallagher was in free-fall now.The final phase of his spectacular fall would not come until that evening, when he was interviewed live on RTÉ’s Six One News by Bryan Dobson.In a relentless, forensic dissection of Gallagher and his campaign’s accounts of his fundraising activities, Dobson secured an admission by Gallagher that contrary to his spokesman’s previous denials to journalists, he had recruited donors and solicited money for Fianna Fáil.In 2011, with the economic crash still the central feature of Irish life, it was hard to construe a more damaging admission. It undermined the central appeal of Gallagher’s campaign – that he was untainted by the failed politics of the past.“The allegation is made that there is something corrupt,” Gallagher pleaded.“There is no allegation of corruption,” Dobson replied. “The allegation is that you haven’t been telling the truth.”“I always tell the truth,” Gallagher insisted.But his campaign was now a flameout. When the votes were cast, Gallagher and Higgins had swapped places – Higgins won 40 per cent, Gallagher 28 per cent, and Higgins – the last man standing after a gruelling two months – won easily on transfers.Gallagher, a picture of impressive dignity for a man who had gone through such a spectacular reversal, stressed that Higgins would have his “full support as president”.“He has given a lifetime of service to this country and I know he will be an outstanding president,” he said at the count.Asked about the dramatic end of the campaign he replied: “Tonight is not the night for blame.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611674.1535566439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says no deal brexit the only alternative to chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab at the parliamentary committee on Wednesday. “You have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said.  Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritain has warned the European Union that a no-deal Brexit is the only alternative to Theresa May’s proposal for partial membership of the single market. Cabinet secretary David Lidington, Ms May’s de facto deputy, told a French business conference that it was too late to come up with alternative proposals for a future economic relationship.“With exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission, or the risk of there being no deal,” he said.“The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered. So, we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.”Ms May’s proposal, agreed at Chequers last month, would keep Britain in the single market for goods and agricultural products but not for services. Britain would follow EU regulations for goods but would not offer free movement to EU citizens and would leave the customs union.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that the EU was prepared to offer Britain a partnership “such as has never been with any other third country”. But he stressed that Britain must respect the EU’s core structures, saying that “single market means single market”, before adding that “this is not negotiable”.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that Mr Barnier was not making himself available for negotiations and expressed confidence that a deal can be agreed. He acknowledged that the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard Border remained the biggest stumbling block in the negotiations.“The prime minister has been clear . . . that the EU’s proposals are unacceptable, mainly because of the effect they would have on the UK common market and the constitutional integrity of the UK,” he said.Mr Raab told the House of Lords EU committee that Britain continued to insist that the backstop must be time-limited and he suggested that EU law might also require it to be temporary.“As a matter of law under article 50 there are constraints on the period of time for which a backstop could last. Obviously, ultimately that has to be tested,” he said.The Brexit secretary said that votes in the House of Commons on amendments to Brexit-related legislation demonstrated that opposition parties shared the government’s determination to reject any backstop that could undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the UK.\u0026nbsp“It was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don’t just have a Conservative and unionist government, but we also have a unionist parliament. On all the amendments that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border in the Irish Sea, parliament clearly supported the government’s position. So you have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

military base afghanistan","story":"The Chinese base will reportedly be used to train Afghan forcesChina is to build its first military base in Afghanistan for hundreds of troops carrying out counter-terrorism training missions across the border from its western Xinjiang region, according to reports.The base will be only the second overseas site for the increasingly active Chinese military, coming a year after a base was opened in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa.Around 500 troops will be stationed in the base training their Afghan counterparts in the remote Wakhan Corridor in the north east province of Badakhshan, the South China Morning Post reported.The report, which was denied by the Chinese government, said work had already begun at the site.China has long worried that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into Xinjiang or that it could damage its economic plans for a 21st century Silk Road in the wider region.Beijing has been accused of conducting a severe security crackdown on the Xinjiang\u0027s Muslim Uighur minority, but says it is tackling Islamist violence. Hundreds have died in the violence.China\u0026#39s first overseas military base was opened last year in DjiboutiIt is particularly worried about Chinese nationals, including separatist militants from Xinjiang\u0027s Uighurs, fighting and training inside Afghanistan. Afghanistan is also home to hundreds of fighters loyal to the Islamic State group, which has in the past vowed that “blood will flow in rivers” in China.“Construction of the base has started, and China will send at least one battalion of troops, along with weapons and equipment, to be stationed there and provide training to their Afghan counterparts,” one source told the paper.The project was considered “costly but worthwhile”, the source said.A Russian news agency reported earlier this year that Beijing would finance a new base in Badakhshan after the two countries agreed to cooperate on fighting terrorism. Photographs purporting to show Chinese military trucks inside the corridor emerged in late 2016.“A key function of the training base will be to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and military exchanges between Beijing and Kabul, which is also part of their efforts to stop separatists from infiltrating Xinjiang,” said Song Zhongping, a military analyst in Hong Kong.“Afghanistan is very weak on counterterrorism, and the authorities there are worried about a Taliban resurgence, but they can’t do anything about it without help from the US, China and other countries.”As Ashraf Ghani\u0027s Kabul government continues to lose ground to a strong Taliban insurgency, the Chinese are also worried militants hiding in the country will threaten its economic ambitions.A report paper last month from the European Council of Foreign Relations said China\u0027s fear was of attacks by groups like Islamic State on its economic projects in Pakistan and Central Asia.China is expected to further strengthen its military presence in the region by setting up a naval logistics hub in the new Pakistani port of Gwadar.The port being built with large amounts of Chinese investment is a cornerstone of its regional plans and will give the country access to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. China will control the port until 2059 when it will be transformed into Pakistan’s second naval base.Please review our commenting policyMan, 30, arrested over suspected bicycle hit-and-run accident that left pedestrian fighting for life in DalstonPolice fury at \u0026#39disgusting\u0026#39 bystanders who filmed injured officer knocked of his bike instead of helping himDementia patients in hospital \u0026#39suffering in silence\u0026#39, according to \u0026#39deeply troubling\u0026#39 new researchLater breakfast and earlier dinner boosts weight loss, study findsEnergy drinks ban for children to tackle disruptive behaviour in classDisease X: China ignores UK request to share samples of flu virus with pandemic potentialOlive oil could be better than Viagra, scientists suggestYoga could be as effective as a pill at cutting blood pressure, study suggestsThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrive at charity performance of hit musical HamiltonRSPCA embroiled in row over \u0026#39trial by social media\u0026#39 as police complain of missing evidence Michel Barnier says he will offer UK a unique trade deal in comments which saw rise in the pound Alex Salmond resigns from SNP following sexual harassment allegationsPutin softens pensions reform after his popularity ratings slipBrazil orders troops to Venezuela border as migration exodus met with violence amid economic collapseArrest warrant leak fuels fears of far-Right police links after riots in GermanyBritish Thai cave rescue hero sends legal letter to Elon Musk threatening to sue over paedo accusationArizonans travel hours to pay final farewell to late Senator John McCainStudents can get exam details for free, as experts predict surge in requestsBritish backpacker died after taking  hallucinogenic drugs with Colombian tribeRewarding children for attending school makes them more likely to play truant, experts warnThomas Cook CEO to meet Egyptian Prime Minister amid claims the company can\u0026#39t access hotel room where British couple diedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"medicine shortages food queues worthless piles cash like living","story":"A night out in a Caracas restaurant to celebrate a friend’s birthday was going well - until the time came to pay.  We had enough money in our accounts to foot the bill, the equivalent of roughly £30, but no way to transfer the cash. Successive attempts to use our debit cards were met with a machine error.

But also a long-term answer to protecting a man’s ability to perform in the bedroom,” said Dr Chrysohoou.“Viagra does not improve something long-term, it can only give some short effect in order to have sexual capacity.”The researcher said medication for heart failure and blood pressure could also have side effects, including worsening sexual function.She advised men to swap butter for olive oil and ensure their diet contains nuts, fruit and vegetables.On average, those who stuck most closely to the “Med diet” had testosterone levels around 40 per cent higher than those who ate less healthily, the study found.Researchers said the diet helped protect against obesity around the waist, which is linked to lower levels of the sex hormone.Unlocking the secrets of the Mediterranean diet“This diet keep your blood vessels healthy and lowers the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and central obesity,” Dr Chrysohoou said.And olive oil had a specific effect on dilation of the aorta - helping blood flow, which maintains sexual function.“What we found here is that the Med diet has a positive effect on aortic dilatation.“It keeps your blood vessels healthy and helps men maintain sexual function. And of all of the components of the Med diet, it is the olive oil that has a specific effect on aortic dilatation and sexual function as well,” she said.Professor Mike Wyllie, one of the team of scientists who developed Viagra in the 1990s, said: “The message that you can affect your sexual function by modifying lifestyle and diet is a valid one.“Erectile dysfunction is usually about 80 per cent a cardiovascular disease condition,” the expert said.“Altering cardiovascular status you get an improvement in erectile function - this study reinforces that message.”Professor Wyllie, formerly of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and now of small sexual health company, Plethora Solutions, added: “Unfortunately we are in a society where people want to take a pill. They can’t be bothered to change their lifestyle.”Julie Ward, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation said: It’s no surprise that the Mediterranean diet – which we know is beneficial to heart and circulatory health – might also benefit blood vessels elsewhere, and help men maintain healthy sexual function.“Because the blood vessels in the penis are so narrow, being unable to achieve or maintain an erection can be one of the first signs of atherosclerosis – the narrowing of arteries that can lead to a heart attack or stroke.“It’s crucial that any underlying medical condition, such as atherosclerosis or diabetes, is spotted early and treated to keep your heart, as well as your sex life, healthy. So if you’re experiencing problems with erectile dysfunction, make sure to book an appointment with your doctor.”Man, 30, arrested over suspected bicycle hit-and-run accident that left pedestrian

exam details free ico says experts predict","story":"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would \u0026#34likely lead to an exponential increase in requests\u0026#34.   Students can now get details about their exam marks for free, the ICO has said, as experts predicted that examination boards would be inundated with requests. New rules under the General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force earlier this year, allow pupils to request examiners\u0027 comments, marks, and the minutes of appeals panels hearings without paying a fee. School leaders predicted that the change could lead to a surge in appeals by students and parents unhappy with their grades. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would likely lead to an exponential increase in requests. We exist in this high-stakes examination culture, so every mark matters, he told the Daily . However, exam boards warned that it was unlikely that the information would come back in time for the September 20 deadline for requesting a review of the marking. A spokeswoman for AQA said: If students have any concerns about their results, the best thing for them to do is to speak to their school or college, which may already have the information they’re looking for. Subject access requests under GDPR take up to 30 days to process, by which time it would be too late to request a review of results.Jake Moore, a security specialist at data security company ESET, said the change could lead to a greater administrative burden on exam boards. He warned that disgruntled students could bombard the companies with requests. You\u0027re bound to get some people who are upset with their results and they could use that as a tool, he said. Before GDPR students could access this information but could be asked to pay a fee of up to £10. Requesting a full paper can still incur a fee, which for AQA papers is £11.30 and for OCR is £11.35 or £11.75, depending on how quickly the paper is needed. Pearson, which owns another exam board, Edexcel, already offers papers for free as part of a policy which began last summer. A Pearson spokesman said: Last year, we did also see a decline in the numbers of reviews requested from 2016 - 23.7 per cent at A level and 14.9 per cent at GCSE - and believe that the transparency in our marking provided by this new service is likely to have been a contributing factor to this.Man, 30, arrested over suspected bicycle hit-and-run accident that left pedestrian

EU.Failure to secure a deal poses an immediate threat to the public’s health and will “severely impact” nurses’ and midwives’ ability to provide safe care, the\u0026nbspRoyal College of Nursing\u0026nbsp(RCN) said on Wednesday.More than 715,000 people have already\u0026nbspbacked The Independent’s Final Say campaign calling on Theresa May to accept a second vote to ensure key issues

campaign has\u0026nbspbeen backed by the doctors of the British Medical Association, and leading politicians of all stripes.With more than 100,000 staff vacancies across the NHS, 40,000 of them nurses, the RCN has been vocal about the harms of a “botched Brexit” and the risk of making it more difficult to attract nurses.It says a second referendum will ensure the public has the chance to make an informed decision on the terms of the UK’s exit, two and a half years after it voted to leave.In the letter RCN chair of council Maria Trewern warns that as well as staff numbers Brexit has particular problems for the health service in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if it leads to a hard border being reintroduced.Ms Trewern said: “As the debate across our membership has made clear, the implications of Brexit for the health and care system will be numerous.“There are risks that, if not credibly addressed, may damage population health, as well as severely impact on our members’ ability to provide safe and effective care for their patients in both the short and the long term.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she

figures showedHouse prices in London are set to fall this year and next, and could crash if a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspoccurs, according to a Reuters poll of property experts and analysts. Respondents predicted prices in the capital will fall 1.6 per cent this year\u0026nbspand 0.1 per cent in 2019, although for the UK in general they are set to rise 2 per cent this year and next, and 2.3 per cent in 2020. The national average price for a property was £301,973 in August, and in London it rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019, the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest response 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates. However\u0026nbsprisks lie substantially to the downside,” said Andrew Brigden, at Fathom Consulting.“Were interest rates to return to pre-crisis levels, or higher – which may prove necessary if there were a sharp fall in sterling after a general election, for example – then house prices could fall by around 40 per cent.”UK house prices should be frozen for five years, think tank saysThis London area has seen the highest 20-year house price growth in UKThe Bank of England recently raised interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis, and said the rate would continue to increase at a gradual pace over the next few years. Survey respondents also noted the weaker pound – sterling fell to a one year low against the euro this week – should be attracting foreign investors to the UK property market, but said uncertainty around Brexit was keeping them away. Recent data from\u0026nbspRightmove showed asking prices in the UK dropped by more than £7,000 in August, due to more sellers arriving on the market.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/26/12/walls.jpg","title":"deport families remove detain children home office inspectors report tinsley house gatwick","story":"Created with Sketch.Campaigners say detaining families with no likely chance of removing them feeds\u0026nbspinto\u0026nbsphostile environment\u0026nbspand amounts\u0026nbspto \u0027brutal and unnecessary\u0027\u0026nbsptactic\u0026nbspto drive down immigrationClick to followThe IndependentInspectors observed children being woken early in the morning by arrest teams and escorted on long journeys before being detained with their “often very distressed” parentsAttempts by the Home Office to deport families by detaining them in dawn raids are\u0026nbspharmful to children – as well as being a largely ineffective practice, the prisons watchdog has warned.The chief inspector of prisons said he was “troubled” by a recent inspection into the practice, which observed children being woken early in the morning by arrest teams and escorted on long journeys before being detained with their “often very distressed” parents.Some were forced to go through the “traumatic process” of witnessing parents being restrained, contributing\u0026nbspto the “considerable human impact” the removal process had on children, inspectors found.Unaccompanied children detained for more than 10 hours at HeathrowRed Cross calls for overhaul of UK’s immigration detention systemHome Office separating scores of children from parentsThe report\u0026nbspby the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, which looked at the care of families held at immigration facilities near Gatwick, found that as well as being harmful for children, detaining families was “costly” and “often ineffective”, with 80 per cent of detainees released back into the community within three days.Campaigners said the practice of detaining families with no likely chance of removing them fed into Theresa May’s hostile environment, and amounted to a “brutal and unnecessary” tactic\u0026nbspwith the aim of trying to drive down immigration.The report looked at two new family detention facilities which opened at Tinsley House in June 2017, replacing the Cedars pre departure accommodation which\u0026nbsphad been used for families arrested at the border and who needed\u0026nbspovernight accommodation before a return flight.In the 11 months since the new facility opened, 19 families have been detained in the pre departure accommodation, with\u0026nbsponly four of them eventually removed.Inspectors observed the arrest of two families, both of which\u0026nbspinvolved more than eight people in uniforms and wearing stab vests and heavy boots, entering a family’s home early in the morning.\u0026nbspDuring the first arrest – of a father, mother, eight-year old boy, five-year old girl and 15-month old baby boy – staff were unsuccessful in efforts to find\u0026nbspan interpreter and used telephone interpretation instead, which made communication difficult. \u0026nbspThe parents were arrested and asked to get themselves and their children dressed while a\u0026nbsplarge number of officers were in the flat, with one telling them: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”The family members\u0026nbspwere promised they would be able to speak to a legal representative when they arrived at the local immigration enforcement office only to be denied the opportunity.The family endured an 11 hour coach journey which ended at\u0026nbsp9.55pm, after being arrested at 7.15am. They were ultimately released back into the community.The second family consisted of a mother, father and two children – a boy aged 13 and a girl aged eight – and the detention was\u0026nbspparticularly traumatic because restraint was used on the father and, briefly, his eldest child. They too were ultimately not deported.Inspectors found, despite the arrests being a distressing and high risk process, where force was often used, Home Office immigration enforcement teams did not routinely use body worn video cameras to safeguard staff and detainees.Responding to the findings, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told The Independent: “This feeds into Theresa May’s hostile environment.\u0026nbspNo child should be detained, and the traumatic nature of these detention tactics are brutal and unnecessary.“Britain’s current immigration detention system is inhumane, costly and not fit for purpose. The government needs to end the current, disastrous immigration detention system, and ... end the failed ‘hostile environment’ approach.”Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the charity agreed with the inspector’s observations, adding:\u0026nbsp”The distress and trauma inflicted on families subjected to these processes cannot ever be justified in the name of immigration control.\u0026nbsp“The enduring harm inflicted on children during these attempted removals can never be undone.\u0026nbspThe forced detention and removal of families, which rarely achieves its stated purpose, must stop.”The latest study came\u0026nbspafter a\u0026nbspreport by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB)\u0026nbspthat found more than a thousand children were detained at Heathrow airport last year, including babies and unaccompanied minors who spent more than 10 hours in holding rooms.The Home Office promotes “voluntary return” and offered families assistance to\u0026nbsphelp them avoid detention. Since April 2016, more than 1,300 families have been returned, having not been detained.\u0026nbspA Home Office spokesperson said: “Detention is an important part of the immigration system – but it must be fair, dignified and protect the most vulnerable.“This report makes many positive findings, including the good relationship between staff and detainees, however it rightly points out areas where we can do better, and we are committed to improving. \u0026nbspUK news in picturesBritain\u0027s shop prices have risen for the first time in more than five years as the UK\u0027s sweltering summer heatwave sent the cost of fruit and vegetables soaring.Prime Minister Theresa May meets students and staff at I.D.

And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.\u0026nbspSince 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in Discretionary Housing Payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.\u0026nbsp“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”Chartered Institute of HousingEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6030851  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Brexit campaign  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg","title":"brexit latest barnier raab lidington no deal eu berlin pound sterling spike jump","story":"Created with Sketch.Pound rallies on apparent good news but fundamentals appear unchanged – so farClick to followIndy PoliticsEU says it will offer UK post-Brexit deal ‘unlike any it has given another country’The EU is prepared to offer Britain a trade deal unlike any it has ever offered another country, the bloc\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator has said.Michel Barnier however reiterated that the European Union\u0026nbspwould not ide or change the single market for Britain, warning: “We respect Britain\u0027s red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are.”Though Mr\u0026nbspBarnier has repeatedly said the bloc is ready to offer its “most ambitious” free trade agreement ever to Britain, markets appeared to interpret his latest comments as suggesting he was close to a deal – causing sterling to jump up by 1 per cent.\u0026nbsp“We are prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country,” the negotiator told reporters following a meeting with the German foreign minister in Berlin.But Theresa May’s unofficial Brexit minister David Lidington, who coordinates Cabinet activity around leaving the EU, said the UK would only accept the Chequers deal or a no-deal.“With exactly seven months until the end of the article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European commission, or no deal,” he told French business leaders in a speech on Wednesday.“I truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.”Still speaking in Berlin on the same day Mr Barnier said the Norway model was available to Britain if it wanted access to the single market he has previously said the only model which would cause no disruption was membership of the single market and a customs union with the EU.Theresa May’s Chequers proposal, which Mr Barnier has effectively ruled out, asks for frictionless trade based on access to the single market for goods through a “common rulebook”, as well as no customs checks through a bespoke customs system.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

He recently launched a campaign ad in which he urged\u0026nbsphis toddler daughter to build that wall with toy blocks, referring to the president\u0027s plan to build a wall with Mexico.But Mr Putnam, state agriculture commissioner, has used the presidential nod to his advantage, portraying his opponent as little more than a Trump stooge as part of his appeal to the party\u0027s establishment.A late poll conducted by Florida Politics\u0026nbspputs Mr DeSantis\u0026nbspin the lead with 57 per cent to Mr Putnam\u0027s 33 per cent, with 10 per cent refusing to commit.Among the Democrats, Gwen Graham, a former member of Congress and daughter of governor and senator Bob Graham, leads the field and is expected to win.Her rivals for the nomination include Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum, a left-leaning favourite of Bernie Sanders, could make a late surge, while former Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine and Palm Beach businessman Jeff Greene have their fans and have significant financial backing. Orlando entrepreneur Chris King is also in contention.Florida Politics polling\u0026nbspputs Ms Graham ahead with 32 per cent of the vote, Mr Gillum on 25 per cent, Mr Levine on 22 per cent, Mr Greene on 10 per cent and Mr King on 2 per cent. Nine per cent were undecided.The anticipated winners will be Mr DeSantis and Ms Graham and the subsequent race is expected to be extremely close.The vote\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspjust days after the latest mass shooting, at a video game tournament\u0026nbspin Jacksonville, which could potentially impact upon voters at the ballot box, with Democratic candidates speaking out passionately against gun ownership laws.In Arizona, a Senate primary will see three senior Republicans bid to replace Jeff Flake, not seeking re-election: America\u0027s first female combat pilot Martha McSally, Dr Kelli Ward\u0026nbspand controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, pardoned by President Trump over a contempt of court conviction.The contest has been overshadowed in recent days by the death on Saturday of John McCain,\u0026nbspArizona\u0027s longtime Republican senator.\u0026nbspAll three Republicans had distanced themselves from Mr McCain, who frequently feuded with Trump, and Ward suggested that his announcement before his death that he was stopping medical treatment was timed to hurt her campaign.Mr Trump has not endorsed a candidate and Ms McSally, the favourite,\u0026nbsphas faced questions over her loyalty to his cause.The Democratic candidates are former Green Party activist Kysten\u0026nbspSinema and attorney Deedra\u0026nbspAbboud, the former far better known, widely expected to win and expected to provide tough competition for the eventual Republican winner.Meanwhile, in the competition for state governor, the Republican incumbent Doug Ducey\u0026nbspis facing a challenge from his own side in Arizona\u0027s former secretary of state, Ken Bennett.Their Democratic rivals are David Garcia, a former Department of Education official, state senator Steve Farley and YMCA CEO Kelly Fryer.Mr Ducey is expected to see off his Republican challenger while Mr Garcia is broadly expected to win out among the Democrats and would represent a progressive choice, backing universal healthcare and campaign finance reform.Oklahoma will see Republicans Mick Cornett and Kevin Stitt\u0026nbspenter a run-off for the nomination to challenge Democrat Drew Edmondson\u0026nbspfor state governor, the latter securing his place in June, having previously run unsuccessfully in 2010.Mr Cornett is Oklahoma City mayor while Mr Stitt\u0026nbspis a Tulsa businessman offering himself as an outsider to the party establishment.The two have already been chosen among 10 candidates to replace Mary Fallin, whose term of office has expired and who was widely unpopular after mishandling the state budget, resulting in cuts to public school funding and a round of teacher\u0027s strikes.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/23/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi.jpg","title":"aung san suu kyi nobel peace prize myanmar rohingya genocide","story":"Created with Sketch.Leader of Myanmar government criticised for failing to speak out against military crackdownClick to followThe IndependentAung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracyAung\u0026nbspSan Suu Kyi\u0026nbspwill not be stripped of her Nobel Peace Prize despite a United Nations report which said Myanmar’s military carried out an act of genocide against Rohingya\u0026nbspMuslims.UN investigators said Myanmar’s military took part in mass killings and gang rapes and its top generals should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Ms\u0026nbspSuu Kyi, who leads the government of Myanmar and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, has been criticised for failing to speak out against the military crackdown in Rakhine\u0026nbspstate.Myanmar rejects UN investigators’ report on Rohingya genocideUN investigators call for Myanmar generals to be tried for genocideMeet the Rohingya who had parents gunned down before their eyesRohingya children\u0027s drawings show horrific violence they sufferedBut the Norwegian Nobel Committee said her prize would not be withdrawn.“It’s important to remember that a Nobel Prize, whether in Physics, Literature or Peace, is awarded for some prize-worthy effort or achievement of the past,” said Olav Njoelstad, the secretary of the committee.“Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy and freedom up until 1991, the year she was awarded the prize,” he said.The rules regulating the Nobel Prizes do not allow for a prize to be withdrawn, he added.\u0026nbspLast year, the head of the committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, also said it would not strip the award after previous criticism of Ms\u0026nbspSuu Kyi’s role in the Rohingya crisis.“We don’t do it.

authorities decided to “to leniently condone him” and expel him on\u0026nbsphumanitarian\u0026nbspgrounds.Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters his\u0026nbspgovernment was doing its “utmost”, but refused to give further details, citing the sensitivity of the issue.Japan’s government confirmed about two weeks ago that it was looking into reports that one of its citizens was being held in North Korea, but has not identified the person by name.Japan’s Kyodo News agency, citing a government source, said the person was believed to be a videographer in his thirties and may have been suspected of shooting video of a military facility while on a group tour to Nampo, a port city in western North Korea.The government had sought his release through the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, Kyodo said.Japan does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.North Korea has also arrested other foreign nationals.Three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state activities

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.American college student Otto Warmbier, who was arrested by North Korean authorities in January 2016 after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years in prison, died in June 2017, days after he was repatriated to the US with severe brain damage.Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and had compounded the dire state of

as an attempt by North Korea to get Japan to make concessions ahead of their planned normalisation talks.Japan and North Korea have also had disputes over abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago.Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train agents in Japanese language and culture to spy on South Korea.Pyongyang has acknowledged abducting only 13 of them and said eight of them had died.Five others allowed by the North to visit Japan in 2002 stayed.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click

This is wrong.“Our country’s attitude towards women is unique and compassionate.“We understand that not only do they work, but usually\u0026nbspthey are the backbone of the entire home, caring for the family, educating the children and taking care of the grandchildren.”The use of a rare televised address to make the climbdown pointed to the hostility that Mr Putin has faced in the wake of the proposals.The plans were unveiled on the opening day of Russia’s World Cup,\u0026nbspprompting critics to complain that the government was attempting to bury the news amid football-inspired national pride.Demonstrations followed across Russia although a ban on protests in 11 host cities diluted their impact on the gathered world media.\u0026nbspLeading government critic Alexei Navalny – who was jailed on Monday for 30 days over his involvement in a protest at the beginning of the year – has called for demonstrations to be held on 9 September against the reforms.\u0026nbspDespite a resounding victory in the March presidential election, Mr Putin’s approval ratings have dropped below 70 per cent – the lowest level since the 2014 annexation of Crimea.In an attempt to win back favour among Russia’s pensioners – among\u0026nbspthe president’s staunchest supporters, who have seen their incomes rising steadily – Mr Putin suggested senior citizens would keep their entitlement to benefits including tax breaks even before they reach the retirement age.The plan would, Mr Putin said, ultimately lead to an increase in the pension that iniduals received each month of around 6,000 roubles (£70).The draft law also suggests allowing women who have worked for at least 37 years and men who have worked for 42 years to be eligible for early retirement.And it would offer new protections for older workers to prevent them being refused a job because of their age.Russia’s economy has been dogged in recent years by Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea and a fall in global oil prices.But the country faces another structural problem: an ageing population.Around 20 per cent of Russia’s population is aged 65 or over, compared with a worldwide average of just over 10 per cent.Mr Putin has said Russia’s pension system, which faces a daily bill of 20 billion roubles (£227m), “would crack and eventually collapse” if it was not reformed.In Russia, the average life expectancy for women is 78 and 67 for men.Many Russian families, especially in rural areas and small towns, have relied on pensions as an extra income at a time when younger people often struggle to find a stable job.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1009746_1.jpg","title":"Brexit latest news Dominic Raab EU Theresa May peers","story":"The Brexit Secretary was grilled about the\u0026nbspterms of the UK\u0027s departure from the EU by members of the House of Lords\u0027\u0026nbspEU Committee.Mr Raab told peers that a deal was within our sights despite reports of growing tensions between Brussels and the UK government.The minister said the negotiations would intensity as Britain\u0027s exit date edges closer.Mr Raab was also asked about the future of the Irish border and Theresa May\u0027s proposed new customs arrangement with Brussels.His comments came as Michel Barnier said the EU was prepared to offer the UK a deal like no other third country.The joint speeches sent the Pound surging.Earlier today, ex-leader of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron demanded pro-EU MPs quit their parties and form an alliance against Brexit.Mr Farron was speaking in an interview with Politico released today.Meanwhile, Mrs May will continue her diplomatic trip to Africa as she meets Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari in Lagos.The Prime Minister yesterday visited South Africa, where she\u0026nbspmade her pitch for the UK to help develop Africa in the post-Brexit world.Follow the latest Brexit updates below with Express\u0027s live blog...

I don\u0027t think it could be safely assumed on anyone\u0027s side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.After a mobile phone sounded in the committee room, the Cabinet minister joked: It\u0027s probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.Dominic Raab (Image: )Earlier yesterday, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington appealed for compromise from the EU side on the basis of co-operation over trade.With exactly seven months until the end of the Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal, he said, referring to the EU\u0027s rulebook for leaving the bloc.The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered.So we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship, he added.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its GDP is growing rapidly. Similar to India, its middle classes are rocketing. And its workforce is estimated to be larger than China’s by 2035.Over 17 millions Brits voted for a Brexit that would make us a freer, richer country.This is exactly the type of buccaneering move that will make that vision a reality.THE EU’s threats regarding a No Deal Brexit are total bluster.The bloc claims there will be chaos if we leave without a deal, that the impact on trade and travel will be so severe we will crawl back to the negotiating table.But behind closed doors, the EU admits this is codswallop.The EU Commission has drawn up secret No Deal plans that are “very similar” to Britain’s Brexit preparation.In other words, in the event of a No Deal they will keep things almost exactly the same because they don’t want to be hit.What a surprise.WHEN will Labour moderates realise their party is beyond repair?Jewish Labour MPs need bodyguards for the party conference next month. There is a backlog of anti-Semitism complaints that could take YEARS to probe. And their leader is an ­anti-Semitic IRA-apologist, who counts the former BNP leader and the KKK among his cheerleaders.By staying in the party, Labour MPs signal that they want Corbyn to be PM.No amount of tribal loyalty can make them think that is a good idea.IT is shocking that deadly diet pills are being brazenly flogged on Instagram.The Facebook-owned company must better protect youngsters.It should hire a proper workforce to establish oversight of what is put online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Contact your energy firm as soon as you can and discuss your situation.It has to help you reach a solution, likely through a payment plan.This is where you pay a fixed-amount which you can afford over a set period of time.The plan will cover the debt you owe and the energy you are using now.If you cant reach an agreement, your supplier might insist on installing a pre-payment meter but this is only as a last resort.A government spokesperson said: “We spend £24bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428041155.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eus chief negotiator accused of avoiding brexit talks with dominic raab while posting pics from his holiday","story":"The pound soared after Michel Barnier’s comments that Britain could end up with an unprecedentedly close relationship with Brussels after it exits the bloc in March next year.Speaking in Berlin he appeared to break months of stalemate by saying: “We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country.”After holding meetings with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, he added that the agreement could include economic as well as foreign and security policy ties.Mr Barnier has repeatedly said the UK will not be able to cherry pick its own bespoke agreement.He has stuck to the line that we will have to follow an existing model such as the relationship Norway or Canada currently enjoy with Brussels.But todays comments mark the most significant shift in rhetoric by the EUs top brass in months, and raises hopes of a deal being hammered out this autumn.And it is a significant boost for Theresa May, who has spent the summer trying to convince leaders across the continent to accept her White Paper proposals.However he also warned: “We respect Britains red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are.Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte.In response to Mr Barnier’s change in stance, sterling rallied sharply against both the dollar and the euro this afternoon as the markets reacted to the decreasing chance of there being a “no deal” Brexit.His comments came just as the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was appearing in front of Lords Committee to answer questions about how the EU negotiations were going.He rejected suggestions from a Labour peer that Theresa May’s Chequers agreement amounted to “begging for a deal, saying: “I don’t beg.”And he said he was prepared to play hardball with Brussels over our £39billion “divorce payment”, suggesting the UK could choose to withhold some of it if a long-term agreement cannot be agreed.The Cabinet minister added: Im confident that a deal is within our sights. Were bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.There was a light-hearted moment when Lord Liddle’s mobile phone went off in the committee room and Mr Raab joked: Its probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.He had been speaking about the UK’s plans for providing the EU with a the financial settlement, saying a “no-deal” scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU.Mr Raab said: The financial settlement, as its calibrated in the withdrawal agreement, reflects a whole range of considerations not just the strict legal obligations.“And if we left with no deal then not only would there be a question around quite what the shape of those financial obligations were as a matter of strict law, but secondly on the timing.Remember that the timing of payments is actually - we overlook it on our side - rather important on the EU side because of the way money is distributed.“But I dont think it could be safely assumed on anyones side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.It comes as Mr Barnier was accused of avoiding having more Brexit talks with Mr Raab because of diary issues - while also posting pictures from his holidayHe previously said he is available 24-7 for discussions with the Brexit Secretary – but the minister has complained his requests for discussions have been knocked back by Brussels.Earlier this month the pair vowed to speed up the drawn-out process of debating Theresa May’s Chequers plan with the autumn deadline for a deal looming.They said they would have “continuous talks” from then on, but today there are reports UK officials are “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to this promise.The two sides were due to spend this week locked in negotiations, but Mr Barnier only offered Mr Raab a three-hour slot this Friday because of his schedule commitments.It came after he tweeted an image of himself in the sunshine in eastern France on Sunday.The  reported that after complaints from the British side that has been extended to five hours, but it says diplomats have raised this issue several times.The newspaper reports that the EU commission’s claim, repeated by a spokesman on Tuesday, that Mr Barnier was available day or night has been proved to be false.Mr Raab hinted at his frustration when at a press conference last week he expressed hope for a longer meeting this week.And he also suggested a deal would require “energy on both sides”, as they admitted the October deadline for hammering out a deal had slipped to the end of the year.In response an EU official said: “The commission is working for a deal. Negotiation agendas, including meetings between principals, are decided jointly.“The aim of the meetings between the principals is to take stock of progress made at technical and coordinator level.”The Department for Exiting the European Union said: “Both the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are committed to weekly discussions to ensure that both sides get a good deal.”Responding to todays story Mr Raab said: I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday, I hope that gives you the facts directly with Michel Barnier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was offered free legal services.In a tense Twitter exchange with a journalist he added: Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?Shares in his company dived by around £2billion following his initial comments, which he now admits were made in anger.Last month Unsworth said: Ive been approached by British lawyers, American lawyers.

Let them form their own party, we will work with them, and we’ll try and do it together.Top Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun the plotters reminded him of the Japanese officer who continued fighting WW2 until 1974.He said: They want to turn the heroic mistake of the Japanese soldier Hiroo Onoda into public policy.He spent 29 years in the jungle before recognising defeat - perhaps the Lib Dems and their friends will be in the wilderness for longer."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429208376.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside north korea pictures everyday life","story":"A country shrouded in secrecy, emerging sporadically from its inward-looking society to take over our headlines with aggression and absurdity.Admittance to the country is difficult and often impossible, but from time-to-time Western photographers are allowed in.Earlier this month Getty photographer Carl Court was granted permission to document the Communist state, following its citizens at work and at play.Families relaxing at arcades, kids swimming in water parks, women spending time at the beach and a bloke getting his haircut are just some of the intriguing snaps.Whether it is news of its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons capability or its leader Kim Jong-Uns to-and-fros with US President Donald Trump, North Korea remains fascinating.Their unknown way of life, reports of poverty and prison camps, international hostages and hostile borders make it a country that is truly unique.Even the date in North Korea is unique: it is 106, not 2018, with the country basing its calendar on Kim Il-Sungs date of birth, 15th April 1912.The country is considered the worlds only necrocracy, with North Koreans claiming they are governed by someone who is dead - Kim Il-sung himself.It is also home to the worlds biggest sport and events stadium, boasting a capacity of more 114,000. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429641593.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"swimmer 48 completes 330 mile length of the english channel from lands end to dover","story":"Lewis Pugh, 48, was greeted at the finish line at Dover’s Shakespeare Beach by his wife and campaigners, after dozens of local swimmers accompanied him along the final stretch.Mr Pugh said he was feeling relieved and exhilarated after completing the lengthy swim.He said: Its been very, very long, weve been going for 49 days and Im exhausted, physically exhausted, mentally exhausted, so delighted to be here.Mr Pugh, UN Patron of the Oceans, set off from Cornwall wearing just speedos, a cap and goggles on July 12, and covered six to 12 miles per day in the challenge.Despite being told he had tendonitis and advised to rest by his physiotherapist just 10 days before the end, the swimmer bravely pushed on to complete the gruelling feat.He said he is looking forward to a really good sleep after only getting three to four hours each day of the unrelenting swim, which at one point he feared he would not complete.He added: I was worried at one stage thinking, My gosh, am I going to fail?The idea of swimming 550 kilometres was very, very daunting. Its more than double that Ive ever swum in my whole life.So there were concerns before I started about whether I would even finish this.”Mr Pugh aimed to highlight inadequate protection of UK waters through his ‘Speedo Diplomacy’, and has had conversations with Environmental Secretary Michael Gove – who was also on the beach to welcome him home – about the need for more Marine Protected Areas.Before setting off, he warned of a shocking figure that just seven square kilometres  out of 750,000 square kilometres of coastal waters are fully protected.He said: “This is a crisis - be under no illusion that the combination of climate change, over-fishing and pollution altogether now are devastating the oceans.The seven-week challenge also saw the environmental activist accompany marine conservation campaigners Surfers Against Sewage on beach cleans along the south coast.Members of the group joined him on the beach after taking part in a litter-picking exercise in anticipation of his arrival.After completing the “once-in-a-lifetime” swim, Mr Pugh said there were plans for swims in other countries, as other countries needed to protect their coastlines."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004225921841.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm bans sale of energy drinks kids","story":"The sweeping ban will also cover higher caffeine drinks like Monster that have been blamed for suicides and will apply to all retailers.The crackdown comes after supermarket regulations prohibiting under-16s from consuming the dangerous cans was branded a failure by health chiefs.Almost a third of teens have consume the drinks - with a quarter of 6-9 years olds admitting buying the high sugar beverages.The government is to launch at 12-week consultation on whether to set the ban at 16 or 18.Speaking during her Africa tour, the Prime Minister Theresa May said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children.“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”A Downing Street source added that on the ban that “it is a question of how, not whether we do it.”Existing industry labelling guidelines require any high caffeine drinks to carry a warning and state it is not recommended for children.But now the sale of any drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre is to be put under similar restrictions used to protect kids from fireworks and cigarettes in shops.Red Bull has more than 80mg of caffeine in a single 250ml can - putting it well within in the scope of the ban.Monster Energy which comes in 440ml cans has 140mg caffeine per serving.Ministers claim that excessive consumption of these drinks has already been linked to health issues in children like headaches, sleep problems, stomach aches and hyperactivity.And teachers claim the drinks lead to bad behaviour in the classrooms - with British adolescents consuming 50 per cent more cans than European school kids.Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: “We all have a responsibility to protect children from products that are damaging to their health and education, and we know that drinks packed to the brim with caffeine, and often sugar, are becoming a common fixture of their diet.Chief Executive of Public Health England Duncan Selbie added: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar“Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.”The measure comes in the next wave of the Childhood Obesity Strategy, but last night sparked an angry backlash from some in Government.One senior Minister hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day” after electric shock dog collars and clampdowns on single use plastic.They fumed: Every day, something else banned. Its just so depressing.However the move was welcomed by Jamie Oliver who said: “We have a massive problem with kids and energy drinks.The campaigning TV chef added: “Too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast.“Teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted in classrooms because of these drinks, packed with stimulants.He added: “It’s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids.“I’m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the Government this is the right thing to do.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to cut through the confusion and ease anxieties around allergies and make catering for affected people easier.Jo Johnson, from Asda, said: “We’re dedicated to helping make sure allergies and intolerances aren’t seen as a burden, or too difficult to cater for.Armed with the right help and advice, all households can become an inclusive environment.We really hope our guide will be a positive starting point for this and the beginning of the end to social exclusion of kids with specific food requirements” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Scottish Conservatives said he has \"some brass neck\" for \"an independently wealthy man\" to ask for cash while \"plunging the government he used to lead into chaos\".The two harassment complaints are reported to date from Mr Salmond\u0027s time as first minister, which he was from 2007 to 2014, when Ms Sturgeon took over. Announcing his resignation on Twitter, Mr Salmond said he believes harassment claims should be treated seriously but \"confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants\".\"It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why,\" he said.He said it is \"obvious\" that Ms Sturgeon is \"under pressure\" from other political parties to suspend him, \"given recent party precedents\".Mr Salmond added that he has \"always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations\" as the UK abides by the concept of innocent until proven guilty.

The complaints about Mr Salmond were made in January, just weeks after the new harassment complaints procedure was introduced - with Ms Sturgeon\u0027s stamp of approval.Ms Sturgeon has admitted her relationship with Mr Salmond has left her in an \"extremely difficult situation\" and the case would be \"upsetting\" for the SNP.But, she added the complaints \"could not be ignored or swept under the carpet\"."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/02/2048x1152/skynews-ed-sheeran-glastonbury_4242333.jpg?20180227153202 ","title":"ed sheeran reveals he played himself in danny boyles new film","story":"In contrast, his \"Game of Thrones thing\" simply involved \"popping in for a day and making a cameo\".This time, however, he was spending \"full days on set, like full 12-hour days\".Sheeran explained: \"They shot it around loads of my gigs.

But it didn\u0027t work quite like that.Instead, I just got more and more tired as the swim progressed. The cumulative toll of kilometres of strokes, combined with an injury and lack of sleep, really put a strain on the whole thing.It hasn\u0027t just been tough on me, but on the whole team.

There have been beacons of inspiration, too.Like the community in Lyme Bay that teamed up with an NGO to protect their marine environment or the efforts by scientists in Portsmouth to save the last remnants of what used to be the biggest oyster bed in Britain or the Plymouth family that galvanised their community to stand up to dumping in Whitsand Bay.They are all heroes. Despite these valiant efforts, the situation for our seas and oceans is dire. I have been deeply shocked by how little wildlife I have seen over the last 50 days, besides far too many jellyfish - and not just for my comfort level, but for the oceans, since these are an indicator species for the effects of climate change.The only other marine animals we\u0027ve seen over the 330 miles have been a few dolphins, one turtle which dived when I saw it, and a lone shark. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the big industrial fishing trawlers that suck up every living thing in their path are having a devastating impact on our marine environment.Our seas are in crisis and real action is needed right now. Despite my deep fatigue, my real work begins now.I need to drive our message home to the Foreign Office, to DEFRA, to DFID, to the Department of Education - so many different departments need to work together to protect our oceans.The task is not small.

Kenyan authorities currently miss out on vital reporting of child sexual abuse material from US-based global tech companies. Secure channels needed to share information do not exist in Kenya. But, fuelled by UK taxpayers\u0027 cash, the new specialist cyber centre will enable local crimefighters to access data, helping to snare web perverts.    Speaking as she prepared for the final day of her three-day trip to Africa, the Prime Minister said: “Online child exploitation is an abhorrent crime and we are determined to ensure there is no place to hide for predators who use the internet to share images of abuse across borders, too often with impunity. “This builds on our ongoing work with Kenya on security and criminal justice – a partnership which has already helped to convict and imprison terrorists in the UK.” The new centre – the first of its kind in Africa – will be based within Kenya’s anti-human trafficking and child protection unit, which is currently probing more than 100 cases of suspected abuse. Since March 2016 it has protected about 400 children and helped arrest around 40 suspects.

Housing bosses say at least 55,775 new homes need to be built a year in the north to meet demand. But the Government is planning to build only 42,435 houses a year in the region, an analysis has found. Homes for the North, a consortium of 18 housing associations, says this is 13,000 fewer homes than needed and will mean 16,000 fewer construction jobs and a \u0026pound2.37billion loss in economic output. The organisation says 500,000 new homes need to be built in the north over the next ten years. An analysis for Homes for the North by planning consultants Lichfield found the Government’s formula for calculating the number of homes needed in 72 councils in the north was based on “flawed” statistics. It says the figures were drawn up during “a period of sluggish economic growth” and do not accurately reflect the true demand.  Critics said the government’s target also undermined its pledge to build a Northern Powerhouse. Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey MP said: “Ministers’ flawed housing targets are a cap on northern aspiration. “Ambitious northern areas want to build for the future, but changes set to be made by ministers will make it harder for them to do that. “The housing crisis is a national crisis. Home-ownership has fallen in every region since 2010, and there is visibly rising homelessness in almost every town and city in the country. “The Chancellor should use the next Budget to reverse the deep cuts in housing investment made since 2010 and back northern areas to build.” "},{"url":null,"title":"safety motorway bridges england reviewed","story":"NewsSafety of motorway bridges in England reviewed in wake of Genoa tragedy which killed 43 peopleJim O’Sullivan said the review would take a number of months, but he was confident that a bridge collapse could never happen in EnglandShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent18:12, 29 AUG 2018NewsForty-three people were killed when a 200 metre section of the Morandi motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city earlier in August \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMotorway bridges in England are reviewed in wake of the collapse of a bridge in Genoa which killed 43 people, the head of Highways England has revealed. Jim O’Sullivan said the review would take a number of months, but he was confident that a bridge collapse could never happen in England.  Forty-three people were killed when a 200 metre section of the Morandi motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city earlier in August.    He told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Anna Foster, that there were no bridges with the same design on our motorways and that the Mr O\u0027Sullivan explained how the review would be carried out.  He said: “If we were complacent we might not, but we are doing a review, so we’re looking at some of our structures but only as a precautionary measure –we have nothing that tells us that we might have a bridge that’s in anyway in trouble like that.  For the biggest structures we’re looking at them one by one, but we have many bridges, we have over twenty thousand structures in one way shape or form on this road network and many of them are all to the same design, so we’re looking at the design and we’re looking across them as groups as well. Asked how long the full review would take, Mr O’Sullivan said: “we’re probably going to spend about three months on it and then thereafter if there are lessons to learn, typically in an engineering environment you might spend twelve to eighteen months changing your programmes.  Asked if Genoa could ever happen here, Mr O’Sullivan said: “No, straightforward answer. The first thing is we don’t have any bridges of a similar design.  He added: Our maintenance regime here in the UK is very, very good and many of the people who work in Highways England in our supply chain are seen as world leaders in the maintenance of bridges so we’re very confident of what we do.

The Prime Minister’s intervention came after former Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks added to Mr Corbyn’s woes by branding the party chief an “anti-Semite” and claiming his remarks on Zionists are the most offensive by a senior politician since Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech. Speaking during her three-day trip to Africa, Mrs May told reporters: “Anti-Semitism is racism. “We should all condemn racism in all its forms.   “Lord Sacks was a long-standing Chief Rabbi, he raised significant concerns but it’s not just him - members of the Labour Party have raised concerns as well.   “I think the leader of the Labour Party needs to respond to those concerns.” Labour’s ruling national executive committee is expected to press Mr Corbyn to adopt internationally-recognised definitions and examples of anti-Semitism when it meets next week. The row has overshadowed the summer recess where the party hoped to focus on its policies. Highlighting the abuse suffered by Labour backbencher Luciana Berger, Mrs May urged Mr Corbyn to root out anti-Semitism from his party\u0027s ranks.  The PM added: “It is incredibly important for all of us in politics, in public life, to be very clear that we condemn racism in all its forms. “I have been clear about this in the House of Commons, I have been clear about the concerns that I see - and when a Jewish Member of Parliament saying that she is concerned about her own party and her position in her own party, I think that is something that raises questions.”  Meanwhile, Jewish Board of Deputies chief executive Gillian Merron yesterday wrote to Labour general secretary Jennie Formby, outlining the organisation\u0027s suggestions for tackling the crisis gripping the party. In her letter, Ms Merron stressed the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism must be adopted in full with all its examples. She urged Labour resolve all outstanding cases, introduce greater transparency to the disciplinary process, tackle what she claimed was “the culture of denial of the problem” and address Mr Corbyn\u0027s “past comments and affiliations”.

Judith Kilshaw and her ex-husband Alan tried to adopt the children from their American mum after handing over \u0026pound8,200. But after British social services stepped in, the babies were returned to the US, where they have since been brought up by a loving church-going family. On Wednesday the Mirror told how Kiara and Keyara Wecker, now 18, are now starting their adult lives and studying social sciences. It was the first time Judith, 64, had heard anything about the life of the babies she had cradled all those years ago.  And in her terraced home in north Wales, she said:“I’m pleased they are doing well. That is all I have ever really wanted, for them to have a stable life, to have a good life.” But she insisted she should have been allowed to bring the girls up as her own. “I think they should have stayed with me and Alan” she said. Judith still has faded photographs of the girls from their brief time in the UK. And she admits she looks at them every now and then and wonders what might have been. “They are 18? That has gone quick. I wonder what they look like?” she said. “I wonder how they feel, the girls, I wonder if they have been told the truth of what happened. I do wonder if they know about me and Alan.  “I’m glad they have gone to university. I’m glad they are going to prosper and haven’t got pregnant at 16 or gone off the rails. “I hope they do very well, I wish them all the best.” Judith and Alan split in 2006 and three years later she married Stephen Sillett, now 51. But she remains on good terms with her ex and he even walked her down the aisle at her wedding. Alan, 63, a former a solicitor, suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and has been in hospital for the past seven months. Judith plans to care for him when he is allowed to return to his home in Shotton, north Wales. She and Stephen still live together in Rhosllanerchrugog, but when asked if they are a couple she said: “Not really, in a sense yes and in a sense no. It is a bit of a muddle.” Judith says she and Alan, who have two sons, James, 25 and Rupert, 22, often speak about the twin girls they had hoped to raise.  “It’s a shame that they aren’t going to university around here, I wished they had stayed in Britain, we have very good universities in Britain. “I would have wanted them to have made something of their life - be professional, get a good education, make good life choices.” The mum of four, who has five cats and a dog and also looks after her ex’s five cats, said: “I wanted them to go into law or the medical field, or even the veterinary field. That would have been handy, with having all these animals. “Sometimes I think about them, wonder where they are, how their life is going because it could’ve gone very wrong, they could have ended up getting involved in the gang and gun culture, I would have blamed social services if that had happened.” Judith has two daughters from an earlier relationship, Louisa, 37 and Caley, 35, but has no contact with either of them. “Caley is in Seattle, we don’t speak, we have no spoken for a long long time. And Louisa is in Edinburgh, and I don’t speak to her either.” But she said she would love to speak to the twins Kiara and Keyara. Asked what she would say to them she said: “Look at you now, haven’t you done well. I wish you could’ve stayed but I’m glad you’ve made something of your lives.” She added: “I would like to see them again, would like to talk to them on video chat, to see how they are and how they’ve turned out. It would be nice to hear from them and explain who I am and let them know they were wanted. “Sometimes Alan and I talk about them, at times like Christmas especially, we’ve often wondered what they are doing now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"colour meghan markle kate middleton","story":"NewsColour Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton NEVER wear in public - and the bizarre reason whyMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton love to experiment with different colours, but there\u0027s one they never wear to official eventsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor16:49, 29 AUG 2018NewsThe duchesses stick to the same colour rule \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton have very different styles when it comes to fashion , but they both inspire women across the world every time they step outside.

But despite their differences, both women love colour and have been photographed wearing pretty much every colour when out and about at official events. Well, every colour except one.   According to the Express , there is one colour they both avoid - orange.  But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not banned from wearing orange because of some weird historical royal protocol - and the reason they don\u0027t wear it is far more practical. It simply doesn\u0027t photograph well.

Jonathan Edwards-Hughes even called Carla Cox from behind bars last week, after he’d been remanded ahead of being sentenced for harassing her. Miss Cox, who burst into tears when she heard Edwards-Hughes say “Do you know where I am? I’m in prison”, told police: “I can’t believe that even when he is in prison he is still contacting me.” Today, at Llandudno magistrates court 36-year-old Edwards was jailed for 16 weeks. The court heard the relationship began in April, 2016, after Edwards-Hughes met Miss Cox through a dating website.  But after 10 weeks Edwards-Hughes started becoming aggressive, accusing her of cheating on him, the Daily Post reports.   Miss Cox ended the relationship after four months but he kept pressurising her, so on June 23 this year she reported him to the police. On June 29 he called her 49 times and sent her 56 texts. Despite her protestations he bombarded her with calls and texts, left balloons and flowers on her car, and waited for her to finish work at a hairdresser’s in Russell Road, Rhyl . Mr Neary said that to escape from him she went to stray with her sister in Kinmel Bay, but Edwards-Hughes was spotted driving up and down outside the house. On July 9 the defendant’s mother contacted Miss Cox to apologise for his behaviour and said he had never been happier than when he was with her – but Mr Neary told the court that she had done the same thing in relation to his previous victims.

Located in the attractive Thames-side village of Benson, South Oxfordshire, ‘The Limes’ boasts six double bedrooms, substantial living space, half an acre of grounds - and its own WW2 bunker. History buffs have the chance to snap up the Georgian property and investigate the sealed-up school room under the ground floor and explore the WW2 concrete air raid shelter concealed under a rockery on the grounds. The property retains a wealth of period features typical of the era including generously sized rooms, servants’ quarters and a cellar.  The bedrooms are all doubles, and those looking to enjoy a taste of The Good Life can enjoy the fruits, and veg of their labour from several fruit trees and vegetable patch in the almost half acre grounds. The large sitting and drawing rooms on the ground floor offer impressive living space, each enjoying a bay window and French windows overlooking the garden, allowing in plenty of light and direct access to the lawn. The drawing room has a restored open fireplace while the sitting room has a log burning stove. The kitchen features an Aga range in addition to an electric oven and gas hob, with a separate pantry and boot room. Tucked away is an office overlooking the garden and just off the kitchen is a good size dining room linking the kitchen with the hallway. Eagle-eyed guests will spot the angled skirting board and feel the floor is ‘bouncy’ in one part of the hallway suggesting this is the now concealed entrance to what was a school room.  The first floor leads to four of the six double bedrooms, one of which has an en-suite bathroom, and the additional two bedrooms can be found on the top floor. While the original house is listed, the extension housing the kitchen, laundry room and study is unlisted, offering potential to convert this area of the house into a significant kitchen, dining and garden room subject to planning permission. Foodies can enjoy produce from several fruit trees bearing mulberries, apples and pears while the vegetable garden offers a good selection of vegetables, fruits and herbs.  And it’s in the grounds, hidden under a rockery, that the nine-foot high bunker can be found. Accessed via stone steps, the shelter is tanked and has potential as an additional store or den. At the bottom of the garden there are three sheds and a gate leading into the church grounds, and one down to the river Thames. Associate at Fine \u0026amp Country Oxford, Natalie, Carter said: “The Limes is a wonderful example of how history makes its mark on houses through the generations.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were welcomed to the Victoria Palace Theatre in London by the musical\u0027s creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his wife Vanessa before the group took their seats in the theatre\u0027s Royal Circle.

The hip-hop biography of US founding father Alexander Hamilton pokes fun at the British monarchy and features King George III as a main character. Just before they sat down for the show, Miranda told reporters: The prince\u0027s sixth-great-grandfather is a character so that\u0027ll be fun and surreal for all of us. You don\u0027t get that every day. You get heads of state, we\u0027ve had some popular folks come see our show but you don\u0027t often get a direct descendent of one of your main characters. That\u0027s very exciting and I\u0027m very curious to see their reception.  Harry thanked Miranda for the charity performance. Honestly, this is a huge deal to us and it\u0027s going to be a fun night, Harry told him. Laughing, he added: I\u0027m sorry you\u0027ve got to watch it again. Miranda told Harry and Meghan it\u0027s an honour to host them and raise money for Sentebale.  Miranda and Harry gave speeches after a performance of the show that has won a host of awards and plaudits. They also met with members of the cast and the charity, which he formed with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho after his gap year there. Meghan Markle wows in thigh-skimming tuxedo as she and Harry take seats for Hamilton charity performance The Duke of Sussex joked about playing his ancestor King George III in Hamilton, the hip-hop musical that mocks the British monarchy during the founding of modern-day America. Miranda, joined by Harry on stage after the performance, told the audience he envisioned the character during his honeymoon, adding: Smash cut to 2018 I\u0027m sitting next to his sixth-great grandson. Ladies and gentlemen, the Duke of Sussex. Harry broke into mock-song, crooning: You say... before cutting himself off. You did try, but I said no, he said to Miranda. Miranda, after meeting the Duke for the first time that evening, told reporters you don\u0027t often get a direct descendent to watch the show set in the 18th century.

Ministers today launched a 12-week consultation on scrapping sales of the controversial beverages to most teenagers in a bid to tackle the childhood obesity crisis. The move paves the way for an age restriction similar to that on cigarettes and alcohol, and the study will investigate support for outlawing sales to under-16s and under-18s. It comes after the Can It! campaign waged by TV chef Jamie Oliver and backed by this newspaper. Welcoming the plan, Jamie said last night: “We have a massive problem with kids and energy drinks. “Too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast. Teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted in classrooms because of these drinks, packed with stimulants. “The energy drinks industry has never thought these products were suitable for children. They even say ‘not for children’ on the labels! The sale to kids should be stopped as soon as possible. “It’s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids. “I’m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the government this is the right thing to do.”  Announcing the plan during her three-day trip to Africa, Theresa May said in Nigeria: “Childhood obesity is one of the greatest health challenges this country faces, and that’s why we are taking significant action to reduce the amounts of sugar consumed by young people and to help families make healthier choices. “Our plans to tackle obesity are already world-leading, but we recognise much more needs to be done and as part of our long-term plan for the NHS, we are putting a renewed focus on the prevention of ill-health. “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children. “It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”  The consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. It would cover popular products like Red Bull and Monster, which are packed with caffeine. One 250ml can of energy drink typically contains around 80mg of caffeine – the equivalent of nearly three cans of cola. Some energy drinks also contain exceptionally high levels of sugar. On average, they have 60% more calories and 65% more sugar than other regular soft drinks. Experts blame them for fuelling obesity and tooth decay among kids, with more than two thirds of 10-17-year-olds and a quarter of six-to-nine-year-olds guzzling energy drinks. Potential punishments for shops which sell them to underage youngsters would be thrashed out later. But officials expect local Trading Standards inspectors would enforce the restrictions, possibly using sting operations. Sources pointed out businesses already operate age restriction policies for other products, such as alcohol, cigarettes, fireworks and scratch cards.  They believed age restrictions on sales of energy drinks should not cause “practical problems” for retailers. Health officials welcomed the consultation on a ban, which would apply to England. Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie said: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar. “Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.” Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health President, Professor Russell Viner, said: “There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people.  “It’s therefore worrying that so many young people are buying these drinks at low prices and consuming them on a regular basis. “The growing market for energy drinks and potential for harm to children and young people clearly warrants further scrutiny. “That’s why we’re pleased to see Government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children’s health.” Under the Government\u0027s Childhood Obesity Plan, ministers will also consult on introducing calorie labelling on menus in restaurants, caf\u0026eacutes and takeaways curbing TV and online advertising restrictions on foods high in fat, salt and sugar and restricting in-store promotions on unhealthy products.

Dolly Vemon claims she found faeces - that she believes to be human - a dead seagull and rubbish littering the appalling\u0027 resort. The 28-year-old had visited the Camber Sands holiday resort in East Sussex for a bank holiday break with her husband, five-year-old daughter and two friends with newborn babies. But the horrified mum said she feared for the safety of the children after claiming they were met with atrocious and filthy conditions and rude staff.  The cosmetics tattooing business owner told : The photos do not even really show how filthy it was. When we got there I was bleaching everything in our room. There was faeces everywhere which I now now think is human as I\u0027ve been told there no dogs allowed there. I spent most of the time crying. I could not believe it. It just got worse and worse. The staff didn\u0027t care. They were getting a backlash from everyone, everyone was complaining. Dolly said they paid over \u0026pound200 for the three day trip but were forced to leave early thanks to the horrendous state of the resort. Dolly\u0027s claims include:  A swimming pool so dirty you couldn\u0027t see the bottom Stacks of rotting food piled up over hours in the breakfast area Staff without hairnets and one staff member working in a kitchen with his hairy belly exposed A dead seagull left on a pathway Broken glass and rubbish across the site Dirty plates and piles of sand left in their hotel room Faeces in common areas Neglectful and rude staff, including one who swore in front of children Witnessing a fight between two families at a children\u0027s disco   The series of shocking events meant the group stayed for just two days but spent the whole time fearing for the health and safety of their kids. Dolly, who comes from Bognor Regis, said: We didn\u0027t leave our accommodation on the Friday evening because it was just attrocious. Saturday we took our daughter who is five to the bouncy castle. After we arrived a poo came out of a baby\u0027s nappy. The parent of the baby didn\u0027t even had a chance to offer to clean it up before a staff member came over, handed her a bottle of water and said \u0027you are used to cleaning up its s***\u0027. I was appalled at the language and appalled she was expected to clean it up with just water. Dolly said her husband is a Royal Marine who is only home six days a month due to work, meaning the break was even more important to them. But the incidents kept piling up.

September starts with some fine dry and warm temperatures, with the south coast of England expected to get the best of the weather. The forecast is in keeping with much of that which has gone before it in recent months, having enjoyed - or endured - a summer dominated by extreme heat and low rainfall. Marco Petagna, senior forecaster with the Met Office, said that much of the country would be in line for a brief increase in temperatures.  He said: Saturday, Sunday and Monday are looking like a bit of a return to warmer days. Between now and then things will be around about average for this time of year - high teens to early 20s. But as we get into the weekend and early next week we can expect highs of 23C  and 24C  on Saturday in the south east of England, maybe 25C on Sunday, and maybe even slightly higher on the Monday.

The respected Russian photographer came from a well-to-do family who were members of the Russian nobility in the nineteenth century. He grew up in the latter half of the 1800s and enjoyed a comfortable upbringing and enviable education as a chemist and musician. But it was his ground-breaking and pioneering work in colour photography in the early part of twentieth century Russia that made his name.  He went on to make 2,607 distinct images of Russia making him one of the most prolific photographers of his time. Here is what you need to know about the prolific photographer. Who was Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky? Prokudin-Gorsky was born in Funikova Gora, a state in the west of nineteenth-century Russia, to noble parents on August 30, 1863. The family moved to Saint Petersburg where Prokudin-Gorsky went to Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology to study chemistry and the Imperial Academy of Arts to study music and painting. By 1901 he had opened his own photography studio and laboratory in Saint Petersburg. From there began an obsession with photographic techniques and the chemistry behind developing photos. He travelled to Berlin and studied photochemistry with professor Adolf Miethe - the most advanced practitioner in Germany at that time. His work began in earnest around this time and between 1905 and 1915 he traveled the length and breadth of pre-revolution Russia which at that time took up one-sixth of the planet\u0027s land mass. He documented all the life he found there creating thousands of images and his work won him applause from the toast of Russian society, and later fame across the world. The photos show the lives of the ordinary people who lived in Russia as well as architecture, cities, agriculture infrastructure and public works of the time - all in brilliant colour thanks to his skill in chemistry.  What was Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky famous for? His best-known work during his lifetime was a colour portrait of War and Peace author Leo Tolstoy which was reproduced in magazines and on postcards due to its popularity. His incredible effort to document this revolutionary time had only started a few years before when he was invited to show his work to the Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1908, and to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909. He impressed the Tsar so much he got the Tsar\u0027s patronage and financial blessing to continue his work. But his greatest contributions to photography were in his work with photochemistry and colour techniques. His research resulted in the creation of patents for colour film slides and projecting colour motion images. He used this specially honed techniques in his work, traveling around Russia in a specially equipped train carriage turned darkroom given to him by the Tsar .

Whether you\u0027d buy a house or go on holiday, unfortunately winning that life-changing sum depends on dumb luck for the vast majority of us. Not for Stefan Mandel - a Romanian economist who, struggling to make ends meet, came up with a genius solution to his problems: winning the lottery. The maths whizz discovered a clever way of winning that meant he could start a new life - and it didn\u0027t involve breaking the law at the time. Jackpot.  He spent AGES poring over mathematical theories, and after years of research, he wrote a number-picking algorithm based on a method he called combinatorial condensation - The Hustle reported. Using his method, Stefan claimed he could accurately predict five of the six winning numbers. This reduced the number of possible combinations in a lottery from millions to mere thousands. With friends, he took a huge risk and purchased large blocks of lottery tickets with the combinations his formula has deemed to be most likely - and won first prize. The jackpot sum was 78,783 Romanian lei - nearly \u0026pound15,000. After paying off his expenses, Stefan walked away with around \u0026pound3,000. It was enough to start a new life abroad and try his formula again.  Stefan persuaded a pool of investors to put their cash together to build a lotto syndicate and invented a clever system where computers filled out tickets automatically using every possible number combo. They won 12 lotteries and thousands of smaller prizes across Australia and the UK. Unsurprisingly, lottery authorities cottoned onto the scheme, and changed rules to ban computer-printed forms and bulk buying tickets. Stefan had a back-up plan. He used his profits to place clued-up scouts around the US so he could determine which lottery would be a good bet for his next scheme.  He set his sights on Virginia because its numbers only ranged between one and 44, which meant the total number of possible combinations was far lower than others - increasing his chances of winning the big bucks. He set up an official company, Pacific Financial Resources, persuaded investors to pour in the required cash and employed 16 people from a warehouse in Melbourne to print millions of tickets. They won the jackpot and plenty of other smaller prizes. Stefan pushed his luck too far after that win - and failed at setting up a lottery system in Gibraltar, filing bankruptcy in 1995. He served a 20 month prison sentence in Israel for an investment scam.

Instructor Christina Spirig, 31, from Luzern, Switzerland, has been training in pole dance for eight years and she wasn\u0027t going to give up when she fell pregnant. Christina had been warned by her family about carrying on with her routines while pregnant - and she even admits she knows it\u0027s dangerous if you fall from the pole or if you crash into it with your belly. However, Christina explained that going into labour so close to her contractions was safe because the motion of her pole dancing would always send her baby to sleep. Christina, owner of Poledance Luzern, welcomed her second child in June 2018, after she already had an eight-year-old son.  It was only after welcoming her first son that Christina found her love for pole dance when she wanted to find a sport that she had a real passion for. After having done gymnastics for years when she was young, Christina saw a picture of a friend on a pole and decided she wanted to give it a go. “I have been doing pole dancing since 2010, after the birth of my son when I wanted to find a sport like gymnastics that I could be really passionate about,” said Christina. “When I saw a picture of a friend on a pole that’s where the journey began.  “Pole dance can give you so many physical and mental benefits. “You can get fit, muscular, flexible and balanced while doing it. It’s the combination of strength, flexibility, art and dance that make it such a forever passion. “Pole dancing has so many tricks, combinations and shapes you can do so that gives you constant motivation to continue with training. “You can also achieve a lot of things already in the first weeks which makes you happy, confident and motivated to carry on. “From the beginning of my fifth month of pregnancy, when my belly really started to grow, I eliminated every trick that touched the pole with the belly and all the drops and flips.  It’s important to make a smooth landing and to avoid hitting anything. “It can be dangerous if you fall from the pole or if you crash into it with your belly. I also was inverting with more speed than just the strength it takes so that my abs could separate healthily – to give the uterus enough space. “It’s important to have a good body balance and to know what your body is capable of. The longer you’ve already done pole dancing for before you get pregnant, the better. “I think pole dancing made my recovery from birth much easier because I practiced deep core activations which helped me to recover from my difficult labour.”  Christina trained between three to five times a week until she reached six months of her pregnancy, although she adapted her routines for the safety of herself and the baby throughout her full pregnancy. For the final two months of her pregnancy Christina trained just once a week for 45 minutes. “At times it was hard to mentally accept that my body was changing and to be happy with everything that works and what doesn’t work while being heavily pregnant,” Christina said. “I listened to my body, and if it felt bad, weird or insecure then I wouldn’t do something. In my own opinion, it’s good to stay in the same level throughout your pregnancy or even to take a lower level class rather than try new things. “It’s important to have the know-how of a professional dancer at hand and the level of practice involved to carry on while pregnant.

The incident took place on the beach of Fontanilla, in Conil de la Frontera, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz in the region of Andalusia. The footage shows the boat approaching the shore of a beach, where people can be seen lying on their towels and sunbathing. As soon as the nose of the boat wedges into the sand everybody inside quickly jumps off into the water and runs across the sand. The migrants, seemingly mostly young men, try to make it off the sands before they can be caught by authorities.  But still some of them even wave to the beach-goers, who wish them luck and offer them water. According to local media, Spanish authorities detained the immigrants soon afterwards near the beach and in surrounding areas. Roughly 13 of those caught are said to be minors. This incident comes just one day after another boat carrying 44 immigrants got stuck near the coast in the same municipality and were unable to reach land.  The boat was rescued by Spanish authorities, who escorted them to a safe place. The video of the rescue shows the black boat being accompanied by the Spanish Civil Guard only few metres from the shore. Local media report that at least 500 migrants have landed on the Andalusian coast on 18 different boats since Friday. In July about 50 migrants were filmed landing on a packed beach and sprinting up the sand at a beach in Zahora, a 20 minute drive from Fontanilla.

Of course, it is not so you can win every game but if you play like we did on Saturday, with this will and commitment to the club, the fans will show they are happy.“It must always be the same as it was against Partick Thistle and now we have to develop this.”Csaba’s also of the opinion his players are now beginning to reap the benefits of the graft they’ve been doing since pre-season kicked off near the end of June.“We have worked hard on set-pieces and also in the counter-attack. It’s clear, too, we have some fast players, attacking players like Craig Curran, Pavol Safranko and Yannick Loemba, who are direct.“This can give us chances in the front.“In the future I want a little bit more movement without the ball than we had in the game against Partick.“If you don’t have that movement you can make the game more difficult but if you have players like Curran and Safranko up front you can create problems for the opponents.”Meanwhile, winger Billy King has stepped up his training after being out since the start of pre-season with a thigh problem.It’s likely to be a few more week before he returns.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csabas ability to stay clam bodes well for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLet’s be honest, most football people are not known for their extensive reading.Other than a glance at the back pages to see what’s been written about them, those in the game don’t tend to stray too far into the world of books.And even if Csaba Laszlo does, as an ethnic Hungarian born and brought up in Romania, it’s unlikely a book of Rudyard Kipling’s poetry is the first thing he reaches for when he fancies a good read.But if he ever did glance over the first few lines of Kipling’s “If”, he might feel it could have been written with him in mind.It’s the one that starts – “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. . .”We’ll stop there because, to be honest, classic work that it is, it does drone on for a bit.And those opening lines do, pretty much, show the ability demonstrated by the Dundee United gaffer over the opening weeks of the season.As his new team struggled to get going during a difficult Betfred Cup group campaign, Csaba was as disappointed as anyone.But he remained calm, didn’t panic and showed an understanding of the criticism that came his way from a support he knows is as desperate as he is to see the Tangerines back where they feel they belong.Most important of all, he stayed firm in his belief the changes he’s been at the centre of over the last few months were both necessary and the right ones.And while that process still has a long way to go before it’s been successfully completed, after two big Championship wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle, now there are at least concrete signs United are heading in the right direction.The success in Dumfries just over a fortnight ago brought a first three vital league points and with them a needed boost to morale.After the toils in the Betfred Cup were followed by a hugely- disappointing home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline, that something was done to lift spirits was vitally important.Having done that, last Saturday saw United seize the opportunity to send a message to the rest of their division that they can live up to their pre-season billing as one of the promotion favourites.The 3-1 win over Partick Thistle, another side expected to challenge near the top, was as convincing as could be hoped for from a side that remains in the middle of the rebuilding process.From the moment defender Paul Watson headed the first of his two goals inside the first 10 minutes, they were in control.It did take them longer than they would have liked to seal the win via Watson’s second fine header in the 78th minute but by the end Craig Curran had added a third.Over the 90 minutes they bossed the proceedings and looked every inch serious promotion contenders.As well as having some exciting attacking talent like Fraser Aird, Yannick Loemba, Craig Curran and Pavol Safranko, the team as a whole turned in a strong display.Almost as importantly, and whether conscious or not of those words written over a century before, the manager kept his head. As was the case when he didn’t panic when things were not going so well a few weeks earlier, he was not going to get carried away by this performance.He knows there is a long way to go in this most difficult of leagues and as he poetically puts it himself, there will be more stones along this rocky road.But he will stay calm and focused and, for United fans, that has to be encouraging.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee star glen kamara earns finland call up for nations league games","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee midfielder Glen Kamara has been called up to the Finland national squad for their Nations League double header in September.Kamara has five full international caps to his name already and will hope to add numbers six and seven next month as the Finns take on Hungary and Estonia.\u0026mdash Dundee Football Club  August 28, 2018Their Group C matches take place on September 8 and 11 in Tampere and Turku respectively.Former Celtic striker Teemu Pukki, now playing for Norwich, has been recalled but there is no place for Dundee forward Ben Kallman after he made his international debut earlier this year.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united fans bid to raise funds for statue in honour of club legend jim mclean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans are preparing a fundraising scheme to build a statue in honour of club legend Jim McLean.The Steering Group, a coalition of most Dundee United supporter groups, has set up a crowdfunder page to raise £75,000 for a statue outside Tannadice.The group was set up to look into raising the cash for the commemoration, and is made up of representatives from the club itself, Dundee United Business Club, Fans United, ULT83, Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation and ArabTrust.Plans for the statue were first mooted last year.A spokesman said: “The Steering Group was set up by the Dundee United Supporters’ Liaison Group to investigate building a permanent monument to Jim McLean.“Look out for announcements over the weeks ahead once the group is able to confirm key details.”The spokesman anticipates it will take 18 months to raise the money.As the campaign is in its early stages, only a few methods have been decided, one of which is the sale of an exclusive print commemorating United’s 1983 Premier League title win.McLean’s trophy-laden era saw the side win both Premier League and League Cup and sweep aside some of the world’s best sides, including AS Monaco and PSV Eindhoven.Mr McLean, who recently turned 81, has been suffering ill health.

The boys need to start taking chances.“The fans have been brilliant to me in my time here as a player and as a manager.“Yeah, when things aren’t going well they are going to shout and show their disappointment and I get that because I am disappointed for my team.”What frustrated the manager most was the dominance his team showed in the first half in particular. They didn’t make the most of that, however, as the home side rode out the storm and then took their chance when it came.Neil added: “It’s so frustrating. I thought we totally dominated the first half bar the five-minute spell that St Johnstone had.“It’s another one of those where you feel you’ve played really well, particularly in the first half, and it’s a sore one to take.“Sofien Moussa has a great chance with a header. He headed it too straight at the keeper and he makes a save.“The goal he scored against St Johnstone last season at Dens was a more difficult header but this one was right at the goalkeeper.”Meanwhile, the Dark Blues have been linked with a move for former Dundee United man Danny Swanson.The 31-year-old has played four times for Hibs this season.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Junction-of-Balgowan-Avenue-and-Old-Glamis-Road-stock-image.jpg ","title":"significant section of major dundee road closes for five weeks for housing project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA significant section of a major road in Dundee will be closed for more than a month to enable the next phase of a new housing project to get underway.About 330 yards of Old Glamis Road is now shut northbound, beyond the street’s junction with Balgowan Avenue.It will be closed for the next five weeks to allow kerbing and drainage works to go ahead for the next stage of local firm H\u0026ampH Properties’ development on the western edge of Old Glamis Road.The closure does not affect traffic travelling southbound towards the roundabout.It will be the fourth phase in the project to create 85 homes on the site which lies between Old Glamis Road and Balgowan Avenue, many of which have already been snapped up.Plans to build on the land – now home to the newly-named Oban Terrace Avenue – were approved in 2008 and later extended in 2013.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"split second decisions costing dundee dear says manager neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“Split-second decisions” are costing Dundee dearly at the moment, according to Dark Blues boss Neil McCann.Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone made it three losses from three in the Premiership for the Dens men.All three were by a single goal with individual errors proving costly.On the opening day of the campaign, goalkeeper Jack Hamilton’s slip gave St Mirren all three points before Genseric Kusunga’s outstretched arm gifted Aberdeen a penalty and a 1-0 victory the following week.And then on Saturday, a combination of giving the ball away in midfield and Josh Meekings’ attempt to play offside set Tony Watt away to score.With the goals not coming at the other end, these mistakes are proving extra costly.Neil said: “It’s not the performances that are the problem but we seem to be getting punished for individual errors.“It’s the odd-goal again we’ve lost by on Saturday.“There was the goal at St Mirren, the handball against Aberdeen and then a poor decision defensively on Saturday.“It’s difficult, you just have to keep on working on things and make sure you are giving them information.“Ultimately it is split-second decisions the players make and they are either right ones or wrong ones.“We discussed some things in the half-time break about the area Watt likes to operate in.“He cheats and walks, he tries to live on the breakdown of the ball, trying to earn that yard and we coughed up the ball, made a poor decision defensively.“Watt got the run on us and finished it well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"community-officer-confiscates-mans-frosty-jacks-before-pouring-it-into-a-bin","story":"                          A PCSO has been branded a \"bully\" for confiscating a man\u0027 sealed bottle of cider and pouring it in a bin - claiming he wasn\u0026rsquot allowed to have it on the street."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-harassment-allegations-nicola-sturgeon-reacts","story":"                          NICOLA Sturgeon said complaints of harassment against Alex Salmond \u0026ldquocould not be swept under the carpet and had to be taken seriously by the Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-our-legal-eagle-answers-your-questions","story":"                          I got into trouble in 1983 and have a criminal record, albeit for one minor offence.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia. The objective of this expedition is to make real change to communities. The team will be installing clean water, building a play park and working in a rainforest eco-village. At the end of the expedition, the team will get the chance to enjoy the heritage and culture of this amazing country.The young people are involved in the planning and organisation of both expeditions. In addition, these young people from the 19th Argyll have committed to raising £10,000 \u0026#8211 30 per cent of the gross cost of their adventures \u0026#8211 during 2018/19.  To date £2,000 has been raised or committed with members of the team also securing part time employment to boost funds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strut your funky stuff","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/08/18, 1:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFord Line Dancers will soon be back strutting their stuff every Thursday.They will be back from August 30 in the newly-refurbished Ford Village Hall and welcome anyone, male or female, who is interested in joining.Line dancer Sue Grocock said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s a great way to exercise, and the beauty of this type of dance is that no partner is required neither is any dancing experience necessary as we will be going back to basics.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.

Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.

Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people. That is the best way to learn what makes the school tick, the young people and the staff tick.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services and a Haddington ward councillor, said: \u0026ldquoI was delighted when Susan Cook was appointed as headteacher of Knox Academy.  \u0026ldquoShe brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the school from her posts in Edinburgh, which include Trinity Academy.  \u0026ldquoI welcome her to the East Lothian team and look forward to supporting her at the school as the local ward councillor."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-headteacher-hails-magical-community","story":"  Claire Slowther took the helm on Monday after succeeding the now-retired Paul Raffaelli, who had been headteacher for more than a decade.  Mrs Slowther, previously one of the school\u0026rsquos depute headteachers, was looking forward to the new term, with pupils starting back at school on Wednesday.  She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny. It is a sunny, cheerful, caring place \u0026ndash within the classrooms, corridors and out in the community.  \u0026ldquoWhen parents come in, they are so friendly and supportive as well.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services, welcomed the new headteacher.  She said: \u0026ldquoI wish Claire Slowther all the best in her role as headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest.

Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody!

He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.

Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

They also have a relatively short lifespan of around 2,000 hours \u0026ndash approximately two years when used for around three hours per day.  The move is the final stage of an EU directive that has progressively banned less efficient light sources starting with traditional incandescent light bulbs in 2009 and halogen GU10 spotlight bulbs in 2016.  The last phase bans non-directional halogen bulbs, including standard pear or candle shaped lamps.  Halogen bulbs have stayed on the market until now because manufacturers argued that LEDs were not yet a viable replacement due to higher upfront costs, particularly for the brighter 60W to 100W-equivalent bulbs.  Some specialist bulbs such as those used in some ovens and cooker hoods are exempt from the ban because LED or other alternatives are not available or viable.  A government study found that UK homes have an average of 34 lights, with 10 of them  being halogen.  The Energy Saving Trust estimates that the typical halogen uses \u0026pound11 of electricity a year while a replacement LED would only cost around \u0026pound2 to use, and a halogen is likely to last for 2,000 hours compared with an LED\u0026rsquos 25,000 hours.  Stewart Muir, of the Energy Saving Trust, said: \u0026ldquoHalogen bulbs are now quite an old technology. They were first patented for commercial use in 1959, so they\u0026rsquove been showing their age for a while \u0026ndash mostly by inflating your energy bill.  \u0026ldquoLED bulbs\u0026rsquo running costs are a fraction of halogens\u0026rsquo and they last a lot longer too, so making the move to the newer technology is an easy decision even before the ban comes into force.  Greenpeace UK chief scientist Doug Parr said: \u0026ldquoRecent heatwaves and floods have clearly illustrated the reality of climate change and it\u0026rsquos now more urgent than ever to cut unnecessary fossil fuel energy use.  \u0026ldquoShifting away from wasteful halogens and creating a new market for cleaner, more efficient LED lightbulbs, saving people money in the process, was a valuable role of the EU in driving up environmental standards. We would expect any post-Brexit regime to do the same in UK.  A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: \u0026ldquoUntil we leave the EU, the UK Government continues to implement European regulations.  \u0026ldquoLED lightbulbs tend to be more energy efficient than conventional lightbulbs, which means that when combined with other energy efficiency measures, households will save around \u0026pound100 on their annual energy bills from 2020.

What is the ban?  From September 1 non-directional halogen lamps, including standard pear or candle-shaped bulbs, will be phased out, after incandescent bulbs went in 2009 and halogen spotlight bulbs, or GU10s, went in 2016.  Why are halogen bulbs being banned?  They are extremely inefficient in their use of electricity. Halogen lamps use around five times the amount of energy of LED lamps. The EU\u0026rsquos ban is part of its commitment to rein in CO2 emissions and reduce its carbon footprint.  Do I have to replace all my halogens now?  No. The advice is to replace halogens with LEDs as and when the old bulbs expire.  Will shops stop selling halogens on September 1?  No, they are allowed to continue selling halogens until they run out of existing stock but they are not allowed to order any more from September 1.  However consumers who consider bulk buying halogens before they disappear for good have been warned that they are simply throwing money away in energy costs in the long run.

However, in a small number of cases there may be a problem if you have halogen lights fitted in your ceiling which are connected to transformers.  According to Signify, the manufacturer of Philips LED: \u0026ldquoThe low wattage equivalent LEDs sometimes mean some transformers cannot detect that the light is actually switched on and therefore lights can flicker. In this case it is worth seeking advice from your electrician.  Which LEDs should I buy to replace my halogens?  Light bulb packaging tends to convert the old-style wattage into the \u0026ldquolumens measure for LEDs.  For example, an 8.5w LED bulb is equivalent to a 75w incandescent bulb, while a 13.5w LED is equal to a 100w old-style bulb.  Wattage measures power or energy, while lumens measure light output.  What about Brexit?  Lighting manufacturers by and large support the ban and are unlikely to produce special bulbs for the UK market alone. And EU rules still apply until Brexit has happened.  A spokeswoman for Signify said: \u0026ldquoAs the UK is still governed by EU ruling and we are still within the EU at the time of the imposed ban we cannot ignore the new regulation."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8484186.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"chelsea-manning-could-be-barred-from-entering-australia","story":"  Think Inc said it had received a notice of intention from the government to deny Ms Manning entry.  \u0026ldquoWhich after a little bit of research and speaking to our legal counsel, we understand is potentially an imminent refusal of her visa, Think Inc director Suzi Jamil told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

Of the 78 students due to begin studying dentistry there next month, 52 - 67% - are Scottish, down from 85% in 2012.  Over the same period, the share of overseas students among the intake has increased from 3% to 14%.  A similar pattern has also been seen at Scotland\u0027s other major undergraduate facility, Dundee Dental School, where the proportion of Scottish undergraduates among the first-year intake has reduced from a peak of 80% in 2012 to 63% in 2017 - although it has been as low as 40% at times, in 2010 and 2014.  The percentage of international students also went from 8% in 2012 14% in 2017, but peaked at 19% in 2015. Figures for 2018 were unavailable.  This mirrors the trend seen with medical school intakes, where the share of Scottish undergraduates studying to be doctors has fallen from 63% to 51% since 1999.  A spokesman for the British Dental Association  said: \"The Glasgow University figures show a worrying steady decline in the proportion of Scottish dental students in the past five years.  \"Scottish students are more likely to remain in Scotland and work in the NHS, therefore the University and the Scottish Government must ensure that Scottish applicants are not being disadvantaged compared with applicants from elsewhere in gaining a place to study dentistry at Glasgow.\"  Although dental students in receipt of a bursary are required to work in the NHS for one to five years after qualifying, depending on the amount of money they were given, most new dentists are free to leave Scotland as soon as their training is complete.  The number of places available to Scottish and non-UK EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government, based on projections of future workforce needs.  While Scottish and EU students do not pay tuition fees out of their own pocket, universities are reimbursed instead by the Scottish Government - at a current rate of \u0026pound1850 per year.  In comparison, Glasgow Dental School charges overseas students \u0026pound39,500 a year in tuition, adding up to a total bill of \u0026pound197,500 over the five-year degree.  At Dundee Dental School, an international student will pay even more - \u0026pound203,300 over the five years.  This has previously led to accusations that foreign students are used as \"cash cows\" to prop up university courses and sustain the Scottish Government\u0027s free tuition policy.  The actual number of international dental students at Glasgow has increased steadily over the past decade, from three to 11, while the total number of places has declined from 95 to 78.  At Dundee, the overseas intake climbed from fewer than five in 2007 to a peak of 24 in 2014, before declining back to eight in 2017.  Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs said: \u0026ldquoThis is a similar situation to the declining number of Scots being accepted to study medicine.  \u0026ldquoBecause of SNP government policy, universities are being forced to take in more international students who pay fees for financial reasons.  \u0026ldquoThat means Scots are being squeezed out of their own universities.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not only harmful to their aspirations, but the future of the NHS, for whom international students are less likely to stay on and work after graduating.  Labour Health spokesman Anas Sarwar, a former dentist, added: \"This is an example of how the SNP government bungle workforce planning for our health service.  \"Earlier this summer, Labour said that the SNP government should review the cap on student places with a view to raising it.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said it was not true that Scottish students were \"squeezed out\" in favour of more lucrative foreign recruits.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe number of places on offer to Scottish and EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government on the basis of future workforce planning.  \"We are also permitted to recruit a limited number of international and rUK candidates but these places have no impact on the number of Scottish students studying Dentistry here.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow University said they could not comment as its Scottish and EU intakes were set by ministers.  Free tuition for EU students predates Brexit, when EU students were automatically entitled to live and work in Scotland. Around one in 10 of Scotland\u0027s dentists are from the EU and the BDA reported in April this year that UK dental practices are struggling to fill vacancies amid uncertainty over future visa rules.  The number of registered NHS dentists in Scotland dropped from 3670 to 3647 between 2016 and 2017, the first fall in five years and only the second year-on-year in 18 years.  A UK-wide BDA survey in 2017 also revealed that 58% of NHS dentists were considering leaving the profession within the next five years, and a third of members over the age of 55 were planning early retirement."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night. His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8479002.jpg?type=article-full","title":"top-civil-servant-sent-misleading-letter-on-right-of-parents-to-opt-out-of-p1-tests","story":"  Last week, Graeme Logan, a deputy director in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos learning directorate, sent a letter to councils stating parents did not have the right to opt out apart from \u0026ldquoexceptional circumstances.  Mr Logan quoted advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  stating: \u0026ldquoSolar have advised us that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments, explaining that all children ... will participate.  However, a spokesman for Solar told The Herald the body did not provide a view to the Scottish Government on the literacy and numeracy assessments.  He said: \u0026ldquoSolar has not advised the Scottish Government that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments. Solar does not have an agreed position on this matter and has therefore not provided any formal or informal view.  \u0026ldquoTo clarify, Solar works alongside other stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, on a number of matters, but we cannot and do not provide any stakeholder with legal advice.  Last night, the Scottish Government said they had worked closely with Solar during the development of the assessments.    A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoHaving asked Solar for a view, we received a response and communicated that to directors of education in good faith.  The confusion over where the opt out advice had come from provoked a backlash from opposition politicians.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said it was \u0026ldquoutterly unacceptable for parents to have been misled and called for an apology.  He said: \u0026ldquoParents and teachers who were appalled when Mr Logan told them pupils could not opt out of these tests will be further shocked to discover the letter was based on an assertion which does not appear to be true.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said the government \u0026lsquos position on P1 testing was in \"utter confusion\".  She said: \"Worse still, it seems the Scottish Government has issued misinformation to the directors of education and has therefore confused matters even more. This is wholly unacceptable.\"  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Logan\u0027s letter to be withdrawn immediately.  He said: \"It is absolutely unacceptable behaviour by the government and yet another incident from blundering ministers intent on  making life difficult for parents.\"  There was also concerns from the members of a campaign set up to encourage parents in P1 to opt out of the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent organisation Connect, described the revelation as \"shocking\".  She said: \"It is very disturbing that this misinformation was used to support the government\u0026rsquos stance on standardised assessments.  \"Schools acting on this advice might find themselves in direct conflict with parents at what should be an exciting time for new P1 families.\"  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, said: \"Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the P1 tests, but thanks to this strange letter many headteachers are under the impression that this right doesn\u0026rsquot exist unless there are exceptional circumstances.\"  A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said the episode was \"very concerning\" and confusing for parents and teachers.  She said: \"We fully support the right of parents to opt their children out of standardised assessments. Where parents have concerns or state a clear wish to opt their children out we would advise that parents make this known to the headteacher.\"  Jackie Brock, chief executive of Children in Scotland, said: \"There is no legal basis for insisting that P1 children be tested. There is also zero credible evidence that children will benefit from being tested at this early age.  \"It\u0027s time to call a halt to this wasteful and damaging approach, which is opposed by organisations across the education sector.\"  The government stressed that parents had no statutory right to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling - other than some parts of religious education.  The Scottish Government spokeswoman added: \"If a parent does not wish their child to take part in an aspect of teaching and learning, they can discuss this with their school. This is the same position as has existed for decades.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed - particularly when whole groups were assessed together."},{"url":null,"title":"angela-haggerty-let-the-orange-lodge-step-back-but-continue-marching","story":"  It released a statement last week declaring it had fallen victim to a \u0026ldquoreligious no-go zone after it was ordered to re-route a parade away from St Alphonsus church in Glasgow, after reports last month that a priest had been attacked and parishioners heckled as they left mass during an Orange Walk. In response, Glasgow City Council insisted the lodge change the route of a later march, which was again due to pass St Alphonsus church. Unhappy with the request, the lodge cancelled the march altogether.  In its subsequent statement, the lodge said: \u0026ldquoIn order to offer concessions \u0026hellip we identified the times of the service in the church and proposed times to avoid this. All of this was rejected. We were simply told that some streets are now no-go zones based simply and horrifically on religious beliefs.  \u0026ldquoThis is religious intolerance, nothing less.  It went on to suggest an alternative approach: that the parade should be allowed to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquos and parishioners should all come outside to greet the march. They could all \u0026ldquowish each other well and carry on with our own lives, it said.  I must admit, I didn\u0026rsquot realise the lodge had a sideline in comedy. The notion that an Orange march passing a Catholic church, where only recently a priest was reportedly attacked in similar circumstances, could magically become an exercise in religious harmony was truly brilliant. It\u0026rsquos impressive spin, I\u0026rsquoll give it that.  If it\u0026rsquos genuinely interested in improving relations with the Catholic Church as an institution and public perceptions of it, perhaps it should consider how Catholics feel about these marches.  As a Catholic who grew up on the Isle of Bute, I hadn\u0026rsquot encountered an Orange march in the flesh until I moved to Glasgow a number of years ago. However, I\u0026rsquod met and known plenty of people who would strongly identify with the lodge, which describes itself as the \u0026ldquooldest and biggest Protestant fraternity in Scotland, and organisation of people \u0026ldquobonded together to promote the ideals of our faith.  It would be an understatement to say I did not have good experiences with those people. It was abundantly clear that I was considered inferior and problematic. These views and attitudes may not reflect how the lodge would like itself to be seen in the modern age, but there\u0026rsquos no denying it exists among its followers.  During my first summer in Glasgow, I\u0026rsquod find myself awoken at the weekends by the banging of drums and the sound of flutes. It\u0026rsquos a very odd experience to wake to the beating of a drum I felt was designed to let me know my place. As I became used to the schedule of marches, I\u0026rsquod purposely avoid certain areas. On the day of the biggest Orange march in Glasgow \u0026ndash the week before the 12th of July events in Belfast \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod avoid going out altogether or leave the city. I know many other Catholics who do the same.  On one occasion, I stepped out of the house and accidentally right into the oncoming path of a parade. I initially froze, and then in a panic, ran. Was it likely that anything untoward would happen? No. But that wasn\u0026rsquot the point. These events instil a certain fear among many Catholics. The lodge can argue until its heart is content that there\u0026rsquos no danger, but it is simply wrong to dismiss how Catholics feel about it. We are a minority in Scotland and, according to hate crime statistics, a highly targeted one.  For me, it\u0026rsquos a no-brainer that the lodge should avoid being part of the intimidating atmosphere created by marches passing Catholic churches. If it is serious about exhibiting good relations with Catholics it shouldn\u0026rsquot be calling on us to step out of churches, while fearing for our safety, to help it prove a point.  But all of that said, there\u0026rsquos an element of the lodge\u0026rsquos concerns that I do sympathise with. Amongst the debate about all of this, it\u0026rsquos clear that some of the condemnation of the lodge does not originate from a place of concern about balancing religious freedoms, but rather of religious intolerance.  I may not like Orange walks, but in principle I support the right of its members and supporters to march. The Orange Lodge is an easy target for those who do not believe the state should accommodate expressions of religious freedom. Just as they\u0026rsquod decry Orange walks, these are often the same people who would have complained that the visit of Pope Benedict to Glasgow in 2010 cost too much money and disruption to justify.  And so, to an extent I actually do share the lodge\u0026rsquos concern, and that\u0026rsquos why I hope it will step back from this ludicrous determination to march past Catholic churches. In the end, all it will be is a gift to those who really want to see the end of the lodge, and it may be surprised to find that this attitude isn\u0026rsquot coming from Catholics."},{"url":null,"title":"baby-prawn-or-something-else-bake-off-fans-in-stitches-at-first-episode","story":"  Another highlight saw Terry enthrall, and terrify, viewers with an eerily lifelike biscuit creation of his own face in the first episode of the new series.

Speaking in Paris at the Mouvement des Entreprises de France conference, Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoWith exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal.  The Cabinet Office Minister explained that the suggested alternative models did \u0026ldquonot meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered.  \"So, Mr Lidington urged, \u0026ldquowe need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.\"  He then warned: \u0026ldquoI truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.  But the Cabinet minister also sought to allay fears within the EU27 that Britain\u0026rsquos desire to have a close relationship on goods but a looser one on services would reduce red tape for British businesses, enabling them to undercut their continental competitors, and give them a \u0026pound6 billion Brexit dividend.  \u0026ldquoOur proposals would ensure a level playing field, declared Mr Lidington, \u0026ldquowith commitments on areas like state aid, environmental, social and employment protections and other regulatory standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe understand that the EU is concerned that we could lower our standards to gain a competitive advantage but these concerns are completely unfounded. Like France, we view economic growth, consumer and worker protection and sustainable development as going together hand in hand, not as trade-offs.

He insisted the UK had a \u0026ldquoUnionist Parliament, as indicated in the latest Westminster votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill.  \"For all the din you get around parliamentary votes, actually it was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don\u0027t just have a Conservative and Unionist government but we also have a Unionist Parliament.  \"Because some of those amendments - in fact all the amendments - that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border on the Irish Sea, Parliament clearly supported the Government\u0027s position.

Now the pupils at one school have voted to turn their back on their daily fashion parade after voting overwhelmingly to adopt a uniform of for the first time.  Youngsters of Westhill Academy, Aberdeen, even turned their backs on the chance to opt for a more smart-but-casual outfit of polo tops and sweaters, and instead picked formal shirts, ties and blazers for their daily attire.  The school has had a permanent \u0027come-as-you-please\u0027 dress-code since it opened 1979, but plans were made to change tack for the start of this academic year.    The pupils voted for shirts over polo tops   Alison Reid, the new head teacher at the 1,000-pupil secondary school, decided to make the switch after noticing a growing interest in uniforms among her pupils.  She said: \"I took over as head teacher in August this year, and from when I was appointed I saw there was an appetite for introducing a uniform at the school.  \"Instead of taking the decision to introduce one I decided to have a consultation which asked all the stakeholders in the school if Westhill Academy should have a uniform.  \"I thought this was a good idea as I felt like I was hearing just one side of the argument.  \"When I spoke to some of the pupils in the school their biggest concern was when they were representing the school at events and didn\u0027t seem to have an identity.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchool uniform policy \u0027creating inequality amongst children\u0027  Ms Reid added: \"The school\u0027s been open for 39 years, and we had hoodies and a dress code, but this is the first time that they\u0027ve had an actual uniform.\"  The results of the vote were decisively in favour of bringing in a smart uniform, with pupils backing the proposal by three to one.  Students were consulted throughout the process and the new uniform came into force on the first day of the new academic year last Tuesday.    Sajiyah Zahara, an S2 pupil at the school, said she thought herself and her classmates look \"a lot smarter\".  She said: \"When I found out that we were actually getting a uniform, I was quite excited.\"  Orlagh Fraser, an S6 pupil, added: \"It\u0027s definitely different, because you don\u0027t have to think about what you wear in the morning, which is definitely a good thing.\"  However, S6 pupil Shaan Singh was originally against the idea.  He said: \"I did say that I didn\u0027t want it, but after wearing it, I feel like it\u0027s better.  \"Previously I was at another school where we did have to wear a uniform and I wasn\u0027t a big fan of it.  \"When I came here we were given a bit more freedom, and I didn\u0027t want that to be taken away, but I\u0027ve come around to the idea.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchools told to ditch blazers in purge on expensive uniform  Uniforms have become a thorny issue for some families in recent years, with the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee urging schools to step back from insisting upon expensive blazers and other items when setting out their dress code in an effort to spare less-well-off families budgets.  This year Headteachers were also told to stop sending pupils home if they have missing or dirty school uniform, after a wide-ranging inquiry into the impact of poverty on education.  Yet this follows a resurgence in school uniform within the state sector, with many adopting expensive policies of the private sector such as the introduction of more formal clothing.    Each of Scotland\u0027s 32 councils are responsible for the schools in their area, and there is no national policy on uniforms.  The Scottish government said that about 120,000 families would benefit, with eligibility decided at a local level.  Annual costs for the change will be about \u0026pound12m, with costs split between government and individual councils.  The debate between uniforms and casual clothes has been further complicated in recent years by moves to shift to a gender-neutral dress code which no longer requires girls to wear skirts and sport trousers instead.

She said: \"Given how much we consulted them over the course of last year, we got all that done and dusted before the start of this year.  \"All the conversations that we had with pupils and parents are in the past now, and the consensus was that they were ready to go when we came back.  \"So far, we\u0027ve had pretty much 100 per cent in uniform.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7845554.jpg?type=article-full","title":"no-decision-yet-from-sfa-over-whether-to-stick-with-hampden","story":"  The seven-strong Scottish FA board met for several hours on Wednesday, but could not\u0026nbspcome to a conclusion.

Its Public Performance Measure  \u0026ndash which records services arriving within five minutes of their scheduled time \u0026ndash has sunk to 88.2 per cent, below the target of 92.13%.  It is the third period in a row that the figures have been a record low for Abellio, with opposition parties piling pressure on new SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow transport secretary Colin Smyth said: \u0026ldquoMr Matheson\u0026rsquos honeymoon period is over and it\u0026rsquos time for him to get a grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos railways as passengers face more delays yet are expected to pay more for tickets.  \u0026ldquoWhen the SNP handed the franchise to Abellio, they said it would be a \u0027world leading\u0027 deal, but the reality for Scotland\u0026rsquos hard-pressed passengers has been anything but with hikes in fares, overcrowding, delays and stop skipping.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to bring this SNP rail chaos to an end and return our railways back into public hands.  \u0026ldquoFranchising has failed passengers and staff and that\u0026rsquos why Labour is fighting for publicly owned railways which will serve the many, not just the few.  PPM measures punctuality and reliability, with trains falling foul of the target if they are more than five minutes late.  But using a stricter measure which records any arrivals more than a minute late, half of all trains in Scotland\u0026rsquos busiest stations were delayed.  At Edinburgh Waverley, less than half of services were on time. At Glasgow Queen Street, just 55.8% were.  Abellio took over the ScotRail franchise in 2015, but Scottish ministers are now putting together a public sector bid for the railways.  Last week it emerged the state-owned company behind CalMac is exploring bidding for the ScotRail franchise when it ends in 2025.  A ScotRail spokesman said it knows performance need to be better and it shares the frustration of its customers when things don\u0026rsquot go according to plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe investment we are making in new and upgraded trains, and our recruitment drive to increase the number of people working on our frontline, will help us significantly in enhancing the day-to-day running of services.  \u0026ldquoWe are building the best railway Scotland has ever had and service performance is a huge part of this delivery. Everyone at ScotRail is working together to deliver these improvements.  It is understood almost half of ScotRail\u0027s performance issues related to infrastructure, which is the responsibility of Network Rail.  Signalling failures at Yoker and Rutherglen East Junction, as well as flooding at Dalmuir, were among the top incidents to hit services.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs has been stated on many previous occasions ministers expect the ScotRail Alliance to work closely together to build on lessons learned going forward.  \u0026ldquoWe have already secured the right for a public sector operator to bid for a rail franchise in Scotland \u0026ndash after being denied by previous UK Governments \u0026ndash which will enable a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises for the benefit of passengers and best value for the public purse.  \u0026ldquoWe should not lose sight of the transformational process underway on our railways including the infrastructure enhancements, as well as the introduction of new and fully re-furbished rolling stock with the additional services that they will provide.  \u0026ldquoIn recent years 160 extra carriages were added to ScotRail\u0026rsquos fleet with an extra 200 to follow in the next 12 months giving a 50% increase in carriages since 2007."},{"url":null,"title":"eus-michel-barnier-blinks-as-he-offers-britain-a-unique-post-brexit-partnership","story":"  The unexpected remarks from the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator caused a sterling spike against the euro and the dollar.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 4:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 4:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 4:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 4:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 4:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

As the sun sets on yet another record-breaking Edinburgh Festival Fringe, perhaps it\u0026#8217s time to consider a little reduction surgery to save it from itself.                All the recent chatter about expanding the Fringe beyond its current slack boundaries concerns me. If anything, we should be looking to shorten the leash on this ever-famished beast.            I used to adore the Fringe, and still do in many respects. I am also highly aware of all the many benefits it brings.            But, as the years roll on, the buzz, colour and vibrancy it generates becomes harder and harder to detect through the thick fug of commercialisation and obnoxiously large crowds.For the first time in years, I stayed away.The party atmosphere the organisers strive to achieve every year may exist in the minds of the visitors who knowingly expect chaos before they arrive, but, for many residents, it’s beginning to feel more like an annual occupation.READ MORE: Call for longer Edinburgh festival to ease room cost crisisWe know a different Edinburgh, a majestic city unburdened by the indignity of placing fairground wheels adjacent to its most prized civic monuments.            Latest Fringe figures, meanwhile, reveal that almost a million more people booked shows this August than this time a decade ago. Records are being broken every year.From one perspective, this is great news, but the reality is this unbridled growth merely diminishes the experience for guest and host alike.Yet Edinburgh seemingly isn’t concerned by this profits, after all, are growing too. Opposition voices are drowned out by the persistent slapping of backs and the unwavering faith of those who believe the Fringe can do no wrong.Fringe organisers are becoming increasingly obsessive about ensuring that this year’s festival be bigger than the last, as if maintaining the long-held ‘world’s biggest arts festival’ title can guarantee quality alone.            A notable elephant, or should that be heifer, in the room here is Underbelly. Since the events firm planted down its hooves in the early 2000s, the Fringe’s character has shifted considerably.What deserves to be a world-class alternative arts fest is slowly being churned into a homogenised, cog-driven carnival that primarily serves to maximise gate receipts above all else.If the Fringe cannot be tamed in size, perhaps we should consider reducing its run-time. Three-and-a-bit weeks is an awfully long time to be loaning out your city centre.But that wouldn’t aid the great paradox, as touched upon by Fringe Society chief executive Shona McCarthy, who pointed out that ever-inflating accommodation costs mean the bread-and-butter Fringe acts, the “life force” behind the 71-year-old stramash, are increasingly being priced out during August. She, quite rightly, considers that a more serious threat to the future of the Fringe than Brexit.READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe chief: Accommodation prices will ‘kill life-force of festivals’            Even those who are supposedly in charge of Edinburgh cannot control the machine, as illustrated perfectly a couple of weeks back when council leader Adam McVey made an embarrassingly unsuccessful attempt to have a wall of black, vista-blocking barriers removed from Princes Street. While the Summer Sessions concerts they were erected for were not part of the Fringe, McVey’s climb-down was of K2 proportions the coda here being that the tail is well and truly wagging the dog.The annual commercial takeover of central Edinburgh is wearing thin. The Fringe needs to take a long look in the mirror before it becomes irreconcilable with its own original philosophy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791233.1535522965!/image/image.jpg","title":"sir malcolm rifkind uk must stay eu ally to oppose any russian aggression","story":"        It is in the UK\u0026#8217s strategic interest to ally itself with the EU to oppose any Russian aggression, writes Sir Malcolm Rifkind.                Britain and our European neighbours share at least one thing in common. There are times when neither of us can see the wood for the trees.            The past two years of Brexit negotiations have been consumed by interminable exchanges on budget contributions, internal markets, WTO rules and financial services.            We are left with the wider world assuming that Napoleon was right and that we are, after all, a nation of shopkeepers and not much else. It also implies the same for the French and the Germans, who seem to be having much the same obsessions.But, in the longer term, the greatest challenge of Brexit may not be trade but peace and security in Europe.A deal of some kind with the EU remains highly likely but is not certain. Equally uncertain, however, is whether, through benign neglect, both we and the EU allow Europe as a whole to be weakened in a globalising world and our joint security to be compromised at a time when Russia is resurgent and China is emerging as the new superpower. It is, of course, Britain, through our referendum decision to leave the EU that bears the prime responsibility for this serious threat having emerged, but the EU nations have as much interest as we do in dealing with it.There are two separate dimensions to the geopolitical challenge we will face. The first is the defence and security of Europe at a time when Vladimir Putin is a serious menace and Donald Trump is, at best, ambivalent about his commitment to Nato and the defence of Europe.The second issue is whether Europe’s voice in the wider world will be heard and listened to by the US, China, Russia and other global powers when an emerging common EU foreign policy will no longer have the military weight and diplomatic experience of the United Kingdom to support it. It is not only the UK that now risks irrelevance in global foreign and security policy, it is the European Union as well.            Some take comfort from the fact that the military defence of Europe is the responsibility of Nato and not the EU and that this will not be directly affected by Brexit. That has considerable truth if it comes to a stark question of peace or war.READ MORE: Russia warns UK: ‘No one should threaten a nuclear power’Yet the security of Britain and Europe does not depend on Nato alone. It requires, also, political stability, economic growth and diplomatic strength. It also requires the closest European co-operation in ensuring that Europe’s military capability is of the highest order. Without the UK any longer able to veto it, EU countries may now wish to go forward with their proposal to have a EU command and control headquarters operating alongside Nato, to handle relatively modest military operations in support of the UN or for humanitarian purposes. This is a proposal that Washington has opposed. Time will tell whether such a change would help or harm Nato.            Even more important will be European countries, including the UK, drawing closer together to maximise their combat and deterrence capability, both to support the US as part of Nato or, in the longer term, to ensure Europe’s ability to defend itself if US resolve were ever to weaken. Such a strengthening of Europe’s military capability is quite simply impossible without the direct involvement of the UK.Together with France, we are Europe’s sole possessors of nuclear weapons without which an aggressive Russia could blackmail Europe over the decades ahead. Furthermore, global trade and economic security requires European nations to have the capability to protect their own territorial seas, and our common merchant sea lanes in the Atlantic, the Gulf and elsewhere.READ MORE: Leader comment: Russian democracy fades under its ‘tsar’The Royal Navy, even in its current reduced state, remains Europe’s paramount naval and maritime power a position that will be further enhanced when the two new aircraft carriers come into service.The second strategic issue is how Europe is to project its foreign policy interests in the wider world unless the UK is around the table with Germany, France and other European states when crisis issues are being discussed. The two great successes of European foreign policy have been the financial sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, and Europe’s sanctions on Iran that helped make possible the nuclear deal with that country. Neither could have been achieved without the City of London’s financial strength and involvement.            The Iran deal was negotiated by the permanent members of the UN security council. But Germany was, also, included, in a 5+1 group, to demonstrate to Iran the unity of the international community. In the same way there will need to be a EU+UK forum available when future crises need to be addressed.It is more than a truism to say that Britain is leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. Long before the EU existed, Britain always joined with other European nations to prevent tyranny or aggression in Europe. We helped defeat Napoleon in 1815, rather than assuming that it was nothing to do with us. We declared war on the Kaiser, who hoped we would stay neutral, in 1914 and on Hitler in 1939. We did so not because we faced invasion at the beginning of those crises but because we recognised that there is no strategic threat to continental Europe that is not also a threat to the UK.Britain’s strategic interests will not change in 2019 when we leave the EU. They will remain the same as those of France and Germany. That is the geopolitical reality that neither we nor our EU partners must ever forget. Whether the UK is in the EU or outside it, Britain needs Europe and Europe needs Britain if we are to maximise our diplomatic strength in a wider world that will be, increasingly, dominated by Americans, Chinese and Russians.It was once remarked that lawyers and missionaries make the worst diplomats because with law and faith it is difficult to make the necessary compromises. That is why we have politicians. That is why Angela Merkel and Emannuel Macron, as well as Theresa May, must be flexible and must compromise. If the “rules” make that difficult, change the rules.As Churchill remarked, politicians should never commit suicide as they might live to regret it.Sir Malcolm Rifkind was Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary between 1992 and 1997"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790947.1535459163!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots airline loganair extends global reach","story":"        Scottish carrier Loganair has signed a partnership agreement with the world\u0026#8217s largest airline by number of destinations it serves.                Turkish Airlines operates scheduled services to 304 destinations in 122 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.            The “interline” agreement will allow customers in the Loganair Highlands and Islands network to book a single ticket, via their travel agent, to long-haul destinations when connecting through Edinburgh Airport – saving on an air passenger duty  charge of as much as £78.            Passengers will have the added advantage of being protected should their connecting flights be disrupted.Kay Ryan, Loganair’s commercial director said: “This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland, added: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland.“Our partnership will allow our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of north and west Scotland to 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s “Better Connected” programme. Deals have already been signed with Air France, KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, giving customers the ability to through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich.            Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers a number of benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.In June, Loganair revealed that it had plunged almost £9 million into the red following the break-up of its franchise agreement with Flybe and subsequent competition.The cost of the Glasgow-based airline “flying solo” again brought a bill of about £3m, while delays in newly-negotiated codeshare agreements with partner airlines and travel agency booking channels going live led to a £2.1m bill.            Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791951.1535573458!/image/image.jpg","title":"former first minister alex salmond resigns from snp","story":"        Alex Salmond has resigned from the SNP to avoid a damaging split opening up in the party amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.                The former first minister has been embroiled in controversy since it emerged last week that two claims had been made against him dating from his time in office.window.twttr =              Mr Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him, with papers lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday.            In a statement, he said he intends to apply to rejoin the Scottish National Party once he is able to clear his name.READ MORE: Alex Salmond begins legal action against Scottish GovernmentThe ex-SNP party leader recorded a video message explaining the reasons behind his resignation hours before the announcement was made public. The full unedited transcription reads as follows: “I have been a member of the Scottish National Party for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as First Minister of Scotland. I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service.“Apart from a political spat back in the 1980s, that has been a period of continuous membership. I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. They have been the defining commitment of my life. But today I have written to the National Secretary of the Party resigning my membership.            “I read carefully Nicola Sturgeon’s statement on Sunday and watched her television interview of a couple of days ago. She made it clear that the SNP have never received a single complaint about my personal conduct in my many decades of membership. And the Scottish Government have confirmed that they did not have any such complaint before this January, more than three years after I left office as First Minister. That is the record of 30 years of public service. So let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.READ MORE: Alex Salmond demands full inquiry into harassment ‘leak’ in government letter“I believe that all such issues must be treated seriously, confidentially and through a fair process. In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants. It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.“It seems obvious that Nicola feels under pressure from other political parties to suspend me from SNP membership, given recent party precedents. For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.            “However, I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with Parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack. Most of all I am conscious that if the Party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division.READ MORE: Letters: Nicola Sturgeon is right not to suspend Alex Salmond in face of allegations“In my letter to the National Secretary I state that it is my absolute intention to reapply for SNP membership just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name. I hope that is by the end of this year. In the meantime I would urge no one else to relinquish their SNP membership.“My entire focus for the next few weeks is preparing for Judicial Review, against the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, the initial stages of which began yesterday. My intention is to secure fairness because that is necessary to clear my name.“I am enormously grateful for the messages of support and encouragement I have received,including from people of other political persuasions. I can assure them all that I will keep on going.             “The costs of a Judicial Review in the highest court in the land are huge. Many have asked how they can help directly. Therefore I have established a crowd funder to assist with costs. All sums received will contribute exclusively to progressing the Judicial Review and any money left over will be used to support good causes in Scotland and beyond.“Finally, I will continue to serve the independence movement in whatever role and whatever capacity I can. It is a rare thing to be devoted to a cause more important than any individual, it is a precious thing to cherish it and my intention now - as it has always been - is to protect and sustain that cause.”Mr Salmond posted a video of his statement on Twitter, in which he also posted a link to his Crowdfunding page along with the comment “Salmond puts Scottish independence first. Help support the costs of Alex Salmond’s Judicial Review in the Court of Session.”Nicola Sturgeon has reposnded with a statement, which said: “I feel a huge sadness about this whole situation. Alex has been my friend and mentor for almost thirty years and his contribution to the SNP and the independence movement speaks for itself. While the decision to resign has been Alex’s alone, I understand why he has chose to separate the current questions he is facing from the day to day business of the SNP and the ongoing campaign for independence.“These last few days have been incredibly difficult for the party and, I am sure, for those involved in the complaints that have been made to the Scottish Government. I appreciate that they will have been difficult for Alex too.“However, the hard fact remains that two complaints were received by the Scottish Government that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet. Complaints must be investigated without fear or favour, regardless of the seniority of the person involved.“I know party members will be upset by this news, just as I am. I also know there are many questions that can only be answered in the fullness of time. It is important now that any legal processes are allowed to take their course.“In the meantime, I agree with Alex that the cause of independence, to which both he and I have dedicated our entire lives, is bigger than any one individual. And the work we must do to achieve independence is more important now than ever.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 30 Aug 2018 4:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HOUSING-KYLE-1.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We must build on this while retaining those positive traditions and values that help to define us and which have withstood the test of time and adversity.\n“The visit of the Pope Francis can and should contribute to the new and positive relationship which has been developing between the Irish state and the Catholic Church,\" she explained. \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27463  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south.- Conor Murphy\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity to address the deep hurt caused by the abuses of the church and engage with victims and survivors, Sinn Féin\u0027s Conor Murphy has said. \nThe Newry and Armagh MLA and former minister will be Sinn Féin\u0027s representative at a reception for the Pope at Dublin Castle on Saturday which will also be attended by An Taoiseach, ministers, the diplomatic corps and other representatives of civil society. \nSinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson will also attend the event and Sinn Féin will be represented at each of the public events in the Pope\u0027s itinerary. \nProtests will also be held to coincide with Pope Francis\u0027 visit and Sinn Féin representatives will attend the Stand for Truth solidarity vigil at Dublin\u0027s Garden of Remembrance on Sunday in support of victims and survivors on clerical sex abuse. \nSpeaking to An Phoblacht ahead of the visit, Conor Murphy said that while Pope Francis\u0027 visit is a significant event which will be welcomed by many Catholics, it will be a difficult occasion for many, particularly those who have been affected by abuse at the hand of the church. \n\"There is no doubt that this visit by Pope Francis\u0027 to Ireland is hugely significant. It is only the second visit by a Pope to Ireland and has generated huge interest, particularly in recent weeks and days. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from right across the island are expected to travel to Dublin and Knock for the Papal events and countless more will be watching the events in the media. \n\n\"While for many this will be an occasion of celebration, for a significant group in our society it will also be a very difficult and challenging time. \n\"Many Irish people have suffered and have been deeply hurt by the abuses of the church over many decades, particularly the victims and survivors of child sex abuse and those who suffered in industrial schools, mother and baby homes and the Magdalene laundries. \n\"Many of them will have a very different view of this visit and I am very conscious of their views and acknowledge how difficult it will be for them,\" he said. \nConor Murphy said the Papal visit provides an opportunity for the Catholic church authorities to address the issue of abuse. \n\"For decades the Catholic church sought to cover up the horrendous abuse and this only compounded the hurt and suffering of victims and survivors. \n\"Hopefully this visit will provide an opportunity for that deep hurt to be acknowledged by the church hierarchy. But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8615705.1535445232!/image/image.jpg","title":"cullybackey college students celebrate great success in gcses","story":"\nStudents at Cullybackey College have received their long awaited GCSE results.   \n\n                \nFor the Year 12 students, these results represent the culmination of five years of hard work and dedication often involving modular examinations and Controlled Assessment pieces.   \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nCullybackey College student Kyle McGrath and his mum.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOver 63% of students were able to secure at least a grade C in their subject entries.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr David Donaldson, the College Principal was keen to highlight the many individual successes within Year 12: “At Cullybackey College our primary aim is to create opportunities for our students to succeed and that has been clearly evident today.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I am delighted to congratulate them for achieving results that reflect their hard work in conjunction with the professional support of our dedicated staff.  \n\n“In particular, I would like to say well done to Annie Millar, Lucia Bernatova and Chloe McGregor for achieving a superb set of results.” \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nCullybackey College student Erin Crawford and mum.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nAnnie achieved four A*s and six As whilst Lucia managed to get two A*s, six As and one B Chloe McGregor was awarded four As, four Bs and twoCs.   \n\nSome other great performances of note included: Jade Higgins Aaron McPeake Erin Crawford Jordyn Moore Jack Weir Chloe Brown.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Tim Manson, Vice Principal, added: ““It is pleasing to note that our three-year average for GCSE passes at C or above has risen to 69% this year.  \n\n“This shows the consistently high performance that our students are achieving over a wide range of subjects.” \n\nA large percentage of pupils will be returning to embark upon A Level studies and the College would also like to formally wish those leaving all the very best in the future career paths they choose to follow.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8616533.1535465707!/image/image.jpg","title":"dup man to step down from council role","story":"\nAn elected member on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council has announced he is to resign from political life next month.\n\n                \nCllr Nigel Kells took the decision to step down from the local authority following changes in his personal life.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCllr Kells was elected to represent the Antrim DEA in 2014.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSpeaking to the Newtownabbey Times, Mr Kells said: “I am stepping down because I cannot commit my future to Antrim town and I feel that someone in elected office should be giving 100 per cent of their commitment to the constituents who have elected them. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I have always tried to do the right thing during my time in elected politics and repay the faith of those who elected me by representing them with all my ability. \n\n“Due to changes in my personal life, I believe the right thing at this point is to allow one of my DUP colleagues the opportunity to establish themselves in the area before the elections next year.”\n\nHe added: “Antrim and it’s people will always hold a special part in my heart and I hope the work to explore Antrim’s unlocked potential continues in my absence. \n\n“I will be remaining a member and supporter of the DUP and I wish all our candidates well in the upcoming elections next year.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCommenting on social media, Nigel said: “I will remain your representative, contactable in the usual ways until the end of September.\n\n“My resignation triggers a selection process within the party.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615613.1535442232!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising abseil in aid of action ms","story":"\nA fundraising abseil was recently organised by the staff at Thompson House Hospital in aid of Action MS.\n\n                \nA team  including neurologist Dr Stella Hughes, Nurse Sarah McCallan and administrator Laura Fisher scaled the dizzy heights of the Europa Hotel.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children.

Championships clicked into gear at the weekend with a mixed bag of results for city teams.\nIn the Bathshack Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, St John’s booked their place in Group Two alongside Rossa and Loughgiel as they defeated Ballycastle 2-21 to 2-13at Corrigan Park in their second leg tie to win 59-37 on aggregate.\nThe Johnnies wasted no time in adding to their 14-point pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein demands eu

Fein has called for the creation of a EU constituency for Northern Ireland post-Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nSinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said it was crucial that Northern Ireland citizens retain democratic representation in the European Union, especially as the majority of Northern Ireland voted to remain.\n\nSinn Fein published its submission to the Constituency Convention dealing with the upcoming European elections and the number of Irish seats increasing in the face of Brexit, which includes the creation of a constituency for the north which would have two seats.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Ms Anderson called the constituency vital and said it was important Northern Irish people were not treated as second class citizens.\n\n\n“Let us not forget that the north did not vote for Brexit.\n\n“British and Irish citizens from the north of Ireland deserve representation in the European Parliament and this is what we are proposing today.” - \n@M_AndersonSF\n \npic.twitter/Urc5E0cYCR\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“Sinn Fein believe that it is vital that the citizens of the north continue to be represented in the European Parliament.\n\n“What we are asking for is to ensure we have representation from Derry to Kerry.\n\n“We are not asking for voters in the south to sacrifice existing representation, merely help preserve that right for those who did not vote for Brexit but are now forced to accept the ramifications of others’ shortsightedness.\n\n“We are willing to work with the Commission to tease out the idea of representation for the north, but we are here today to stand for EU citizens in the north and their rights which some would see stripped away.”\n\nMs Anderson said the party were willing to work with any of Ireland’s political parties in order to see the constituency created, and said the proposal required a hand of friendship.\n\n“We’re willing to work with An Taoiseach, and let us remember that the Taoiseach has already told us that no Irish government would ever again leave behind the people of the north,” she said.\n\nIn their proposal document Sinn Fein referenced Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin who said in January 2018: “Why would people object to Northern Ireland continuing to have representation in the European Parliament?”\n\nAs well as Fine Gael TD Sean Kelly, who said in June, that the idea was “worth exploring”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe border between Londonderry and Donegal at Bridgend \n\n\n\n\nMs Anderson claimed Brexiteers were taking Northern Ireland over a cliff, and labelled comments by Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that people should be “inspected” at the border post-Brexit, as dangerous.\n\n“The comments are a reflection of the attitudes within the Conservative government, he is reckless, he is wrong, he is an absolute idiot.\n\n“We do not want the damage that is going to be caused by Brexit, we do not want the north to be collateral damage, we were in a terrible place, war is a terrible place and we’re out of that.\n\n“We the people of Ireland, and north of Ireland, were told that the constitutional position of the north would not change unless we consented to it, and we did not consent to the wreckage that is going to happen as a consequence of Brexit.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lawyers kincora home should be

Lesley-Anne McKeown/PA.\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry report rejected allegations that the UK security services knew what was going on and, instead of intervening, used the information to blackmail the establishment figures involved.\n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: “It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.”\n\nThe retired judge added: “It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.”\n\nMr Kerr, who claims he was abused inside Kincora and at other locations in Belfast and London, was due to give evidence to the inquiry but withdrew his co-operation at a late stage after claiming key state documents related to the home were not disclosed to his legal team.\n\nA statement from his lawyers said: “On his behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings by way of a judicial review of the failings of the OFMDFM, the Northern Ireland Office  and the PSNI to investigate Kincora in a manner consistent with human rights standards, which Sir Anthony Hart stated would not be applied to The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry  which reported its conclusions and recommendations in 2017.”\n\nThis point was argued before the Court of Appeal at the start of the HIA Inquiry.\n\nThe law firm added: “It is a point that will now be subject to challenge again in light of the flaws and failings of the HIA Inquiry.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 1000 people sectioned in northern ireland over","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Even with older people. It is actually the thing that people raise with me. It is a great thing that people are talking about it, it shows the stigma is being chipped away. \n\n\"It is reflected in an increase in demand for services but that is not matched by an increase in support for mental health services.\"\n\nThe release of information comes amid an increased focus on mental health services in the province. \n\nEarlier this month campaigners said officials in Northern Ireland did not share their urgency over funding for counselling. \n\nA group representing 40 groups and individuals met with Dr Sloan Harper and his colleagues from the Health and Social Care Board to demand greater counselling services. \n\nThe joint call to boost counselling services at GP practices is backed by over 40 GPs, counsellors and mental health charities, as well as over 2,000 individuals.\n\n\n\n\nOfficials \u0027lacking urgency\u0027 over mental health counselling in Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Northern Ireland \n\n\nThe figures released on Tuesday give figures give a wider picture of mental health and learning disability services in Northern Ireland. \n\nAs of February 17, there were 630 people being treated as inpatients in mental health hospitals across Northern Ireland. \n\nJust over three quarters of these had been in the hospitals for less than six months, while 16 residents have been inpatients for 10 years or more. \n\nOn the same date, a count showed 113 patients being treated as inpatients in learning disability hospitals in Northern Ireland, with 37% having been resident for less than six months, while 21 patients - or 18.6% - have been resident for 10 years or more. \n\nA person can be sectioned under the Mental Health Order if their symptoms are of such a severity that inpatient treatment is considered the best option. \n\nThe Order recommends a person be first approached about seeking voluntary treatment before any action is taken. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts delays in belfast centre after primark blaze","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They have been the defining commitment of my life.\n\n“But today I have written to the national secretary of the party resigning my membership.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Salmond indicated that his resignation was to avoid potential divisions within the party.\n\nHe stated: “It seems obvious that  Nicola  feels under pressure from other political parties to suspend me from SNP membership, given recent party precedents…\n\n“I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with Parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack.\n\n“Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division.”\n\nHe added that it is his “absolute intention to reapply for SNP membership “just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name”.\n\n“In the meantime, I would urge no one else to relinquish their SNP membership,” he added.\n\n\n\npic.twitter/4lkyKFZcdK\n\n— Alex Salmond  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, emerged last week.\n\nThe Daily Record newspaper published what it claimed were details of one of the complaints over the weekend.\n\nPolice Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints have been passed to the force.\n\nThe Scottish Government this week confirmed there are no recorded complaints about Mr Salmond from before January this year.\n\n\nStatement. \npic.twitter/PrNfXPCfKx\n\n— Nicola Sturgeon  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe reiterated his strong denial of the allegations in the video message, saying: “Let me be clear again.

In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,” Mr Salmond said in the message.\n\n“It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.”\n\nHe said his “entire focus” is now on preparing for the judicial review proceedings at Scotland’s highest civil court and he has launched a crowd-funding campaign to help with costs.\n\n“My intention is to secure fairness because that is necessary to clear my name,” he said.\n\n\nWill Nicola now be launching a crowdfunder for the Scottish Govt’s legal costs against Salmond?

But he later hinted the timing of the Brexit talks this autumn may change.\n\n\nWatch live: \n@DominicRaab\n answers EU Committee’s questions on \n#Brexit\n \nhttps:t.co/kema81kfhW\n\n— Lords EU Committee  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Barnier told reporters in Berlin after a meeting with German foreign minister Heiko Maas: “We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country.”\n\nAddressing peers, Mr Raab said he would be in Brussels tomorrow ahead of meetings on Friday, adding: “I’m confident that a deal is within our sights. We’re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.”\n\nHe added: “I think it is important as we enter the final phase of the negotiations in the lead up to the October council and the possibility that it may creep beyond that, we want to see some renewed energy.\n\n“We’re bringing the ambition and the substance of our white paper on the future relationship and also I think some pragmatism to try and go the extra mile to get the deal that I think is in both sides’ interests. We need that to be matched obviously, it’s a negotiation.”\n\n\n\nWe don’t beg and I certainly don’t beg\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Raab struck a bullish tone during his exchanges with peers, who aired their concerns and sought greater detail on issues including the Northern Ireland border issue, the proposed new facilitated customs arrangement, the current state of talks, plus preparations for a no-deal scenario.\n\nLabour peer Lord Liddle said: “We’re begging for this, because without it we know we will suffer grave industrial consequences.”\n\nMr Raab responded: “That’s hyperbole. We don’t beg and I certainly don’t beg.”\n\nThe Brexit Secretary also hinted that on the financial settlement, a no-deal scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU.\n\nAfter a mobile phone sounded in the committee room, Mr Raab joked: “It’s probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.”\n\nHe added: “The financial settlement, as it’s calibrated in the withdrawal agreement, reflects a whole range of considerations not just the strict legal obligations and if we left with no deal then not only would there be a question around quite what the shape of those financial obligations were as a matter of strict law, but secondly on the timing.\n\n“Remember that the timing of payments is actually – we overlook it on our side – rather important on the EU side because of the way money is distributed, but… I don’t think it could be safely assumed on anyone’s side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.\n\n“As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.”\n\n\n\nWe\u0027re not going to see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a possible no deal scenario, Mr Raab said: “It wouldn’t be a walk in the park but it wouldn’t be the end of the world… My focus as I hope you will see is that overridingly on intensifying the negotiations because we want a strong deal, because we want a good outcome….So really with the no deal scenario as difficult as it is to anticipate what precisely could be the trigger for it there’s a range of possibilities and we’ll be ready for all of them.”\n\nMr Raab would not be drawn on the percentage risk of a no deal, but he added: “I’m stubbornly optimistic.”\n\nSpeaking about the Northern Ireland border, Mr Raab said: “What I can say is we’re both committed to a solution and there is a lot of interesting, innovative technical work to make sure we resolve it.”\n\nHe added: “We’re not going to see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea.\n\n“We’re not going to do anything which would imperil the Belfast Agreement. We want to make sure, in a positive sense, that the solution works for the communities on both sides.”\n\nMr Raab expressed confidence in the City post-Brexit, adding: “I think ultimately if we ended up with some of the worst case scenario outcomes that some people have suggested, so that the EU would take this as an opportunity and, by the way I don’t believe this, to try and either hive-off large areas of the work that’s done in London or punish the City, I think the only winners would be the other global centres in the top 10 like Tokyo and New York.”\n\nResponding to Mr Barnier’s comments, a Government spokesman said: “Both the UK and the EU are committed to reaching the best deal possible for both sides.\n\n“We have put forward our proposals for this deal in our white paper and we stand ready to work at pace with the EU over the coming weeks.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"halogen lightbulb ban to take effect","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They were first patented for commercial use in 1959, so they’ve been showing their age for a while – mostly by inflating your energy bill.\n\n“LED bulbs’ running costs are a fraction of halogens’ and they last a lot longer too, so making the move to the newer technology is an easy decision even before the ban comes into force.”\n\nGreenpeace UK chief scientist Doug Parr said: “Recent heatwaves and floods have clearly illustrated the reality of climate change and it’s now more urgent than ever to cut unnecessary fossil fuel energy use.\n\n“Shifting away from wasteful halogens and creating a new market for cleaner, more efficient LED lightbulbs, saving people money in the process, was a valuable role of the EU in driving up environmental standards. We would expect any post-Brexit regime to do the same in UK.”\n\nA Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Until we leave the EU, the UK Government continues to implement European regulations.\n\n“LED lightbulbs tend to be more energy efficient than conventional lightbulbs, which means that when combined with other energy efficiency measures, households will save around £100 on their annual energy bills from 2020.”\n\nSteve Wrapson, head of product marketing at Signify UK \u0026 Ireland – the manufacturer of Philips LED, said: “The gradual ban on halogen bulbs demonstrates a Europe-wide commitment to energy saving and reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n“Not only does this present an opportunity for households to benefit from reduced energy bills, it introduces consumers to the array of colour, quality and design options when switching to LED.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"the halogen lightbulb ban what you need to know","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Halogen lamps use around five times the amount of energy of LED lamps. The EU’s ban is part of its commitment to rein in CO2 emissions and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n\nDo I have to replace all my halogens now?\n\n\nNo. The advice is to replace halogens with LEDs as and when the old bulbs expire.\n\n\nWill shops stop selling halogens on September 1?\n\n\nNo, they are allowed to continue selling halogens until they run out of existing stock but they are not allowed to order any more from September 1.\n\nHowever consumers who consider bulk buying halogens before they disappear for good have been warned that they are simply throwing money away in energy costs in the long run.\n\n\nWill the LEDs fit existing light sockets?\n\n\n\n💡⚡️GOOD NEWS: The EU is finally about the phase out wasteful halogen light bulbs. Here\u0027s how much you can save by switching to LED lights at home 👇\nhttps:t.co/RJAwMiawTC\n \npic.twitter/tzPBIggaG4\n\n— Coolproducts.eu  \nAugust 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, yes – LEDs can easily slot into existing fittings. However, in a small number of cases there may be a problem if you have halogen lights fitted in your ceiling which are connected to transformers. \n\nAccording to Signify, the manufacturer of Philips LED: “The low wattage equivalent LEDs sometimes mean some transformers cannot detect that the light is actually switched on and therefore lights can flicker. In this case it is worth seeking advice from your electrician.”\n\n\nWhich LEDs should I buy to replace my halogens?\n\n\nLight bulb packaging tends to convert the old-style wattage into the “lumens” measure for LEDs.\n\nFor example, an 8.5w LED bulb is equivalent to a 75w incandescent bulb, while a 13.5w LED is equal to a 100w old-style bulb.\n\nWattage measures power or energy, while lumens measure light output.\n\n\nWhat about Brexit?\n\n\nLighting manufacturers by and large support the ban and are unlikely to produce special bulbs for the UK market alone. And EU rules still apply until Brexit has happened.\n\nA spokeswoman for Signify said: “As the UK is still governed by EU ruling and we are still within the EU at the time of the imposed ban we cannot ignore the new regulation.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry country park looking actors spooky flair star halloween events","story":"\nA Derry outdoor pursuit’s facility has put out a call for local actors with a flair for all things spooky.\n\nCreggan Country Park is looking for experienced performers aged 18 and over to star in their Halloween events.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor more information email \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt man enlisted help pop icon britney spears dublin concert","story":"\nBy Orla Mullan\n\nMOST people can only dream about getting a chance to work for top US pop icons such as Britney Spears.\n\nHowever, for one Magherafelt man, that dream became a reality last week.\n\nChris Graham, owner of Barbers of BT45 was chosen to cut all the male backing dancers’ hair before Spears’ Dublin gig on August 20.\n\nThe ‘Piece of Me’ concert, held in 3Arena, was part of the star’s first world tour in seven years and was an immediate sell out, attended by thousands of fans.\n\nThe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity came about following a meeting between Chris and the US pop sensation’s team at Brighton Pride earlier this month.\n\nChris, who was attending the UK’s biggest pride festival, said: “I had worked in Disney World ten years ago and was in Brighton attending her concert with past Disney friends who knew her team. We were invited to join them all backstage. It was incredible, we were on their tour buses, seen all the supporting acts, and got to experience what behind the scenes of a festivaI is actually like. I was talking to her team and they asked me what I did for a living.  When I told them I was a barber, they said they might need someone to cut their hair during the Dublin leg of Britney Spears’

Matty Young, Cathal McCormack, Marty McErlean and Megan Ludlow.  Unfortunately, Megan was unable to make the trip due to a prior engagement, but the other lads were delighted to take on their biggest job to date.\n\nChris, a former student of Holy Family Primary School and St Pius X College in Magherafelt, said it was a great ‘honour’ to be chosen to work for ‘one of the biggest selling pop artists of all time’.\n\n“The boys who work for me have all been trained by me and they were so professional throughout it all.  I couldn’t be prouder of them.  The dancers were so happy with their haircuts and it also gave the boys their first glimpse of working within the world of celebrities and session styling.”\n\nChris, who has 15 years’ experience in the barbering industry, opened Barbers of BT45 almost five years ago and since then he has seen the business go from strength-to-strength with the opening of Barbers of BT80 in Cookstown, Salon 45 and the BT45 Barbering Academy, having trained over 120 students since it opened.\n\nA former Disney World employee, Chris has also notched up barbering experience in Australia.\n\nJust last year he launched his very own range of products and is currently in negotiations to have them distributed throughout Ireland.\n\nLast night Chris revealed that Britney Spears’ tour management team have been in contact again about future projects, however he is keeping shtum until all is finalised.\n\n“It’s great that we have got a lot more opportunities out of this.  It just shows you that one opportunity can open so many doors,” he

unused water is a time consuming process for our cleansing and recycling teams so we would appreciate everyone’s co-operation.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

Crafts workshop for kids.\n\nEvent organisers will also position Recycling Advert walkers around the course who will engage with members of the public on how they can apply the principles of recycling in their everyday lives.\nThe project is part of Council’s wider Zero Waste Strategy which has the ultimate aim of making the City and District a sustainable region.\n\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\n\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories and is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and full event details are available at

The words “I want to be an organ donor” are simple, but what an inspirational difference they could make. \n\nThis Organ Donation Week  the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is centred on encouraging people to talk to those closest to them about organ donation. Many people don’t realise that their family’s support is needed for organ donation to go ahead.\n\nApproximately 140 people in Northern Ireland are waiting on life-saving transplants and approximately 6,000 people in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately every year around 14 people in Northern Ireland die waiting for an organ transplant, highlighting the real shortage of organ donations.\n\nDr Declan Grace, Lead Clinician for Organ Donation at the Western Trust said: “Organ donation transforms and saves lives and the Western Trust is encouraging everyone to join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones that they wish to be a donor, so that they are aware of their wishes.\n\n“Deciding to become an organ donor is entirely your decision but it does affect your family. After your death, your next of kin will be consulted on whether your organs can be donated, even if you carry a donor card, and any decision they make will be respected. When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S. Donor Line 0300 123 23 23. Telephone lines are open 24 hours a day all year round.\nDownload a form from \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n, print it and return it by Freepost\nRegister when applying for a Boot’s Advantage Card.\n\n\nPictured above: Highlighting the need for more people to sign up to the organ donor register and telling your family your wishes is: Maria Coyle Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation and Dr Declan Grace Lead Clinician for Organ Donation in the Western Trust.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth festival reaches its finale","story":"\nElin Manahan Thomas will be performing at the Machynlleth Festival.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8106823/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nCelebration of Welsh composer at Machynlleth\n\nAnn Murray will be leading a workshop at the Machynlleth Festival.

late scare at Newry on Monday night to progress to the next round and a clash with fellow Division 2 side Carryduff for a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe Blues had a late injury worry when veteran defender Conor O\u0026rsquoToole was withdrawn with a finger wound. Early on, Mark Poland used the big spaces at Pairc Esler Newry to register Longstone\u0026rsquos first three points while Loughinisland\u0026rsquos player of the first half, Conor Megoran, got the Blues off the mark. Roaming half back Dean McLaughlin hit the post in a rare charge forward before resuming his key role in marking Longstone\u0026rsquos talismanic Mark Poland.\u0026nbsp\n\nChris Turley pulled of a great save to deny Daithi Young before Rory Mason converted a free to leave only one between the teams.\n\nHowever, the Division 2\u0026nbsp top scorers have threats all over the field and a great team move saw Stefan Mason finish to the net to Brendan Mason\u0026rsquos side in front for the first time.\u0026nbsp\n\nPoland got one back before the impressive Declan McClements replied and when the dangerous Megoran struck to the net, the lead was increased to five points.\n\nA quick break up the field saw Hughes get one back for the \u0026lsquoStone, but a super effort from the sideline from Rory Mason reinstated a five point lead.\n\nJust before the break the tricky Michael Ireland shook off the shackles of Paddy Megoran to find the net to make a game of it before Declan McClements scored with the fist to give the Blues a three point lead at the break.\n\nIn a tense second half Longstone started the brighter and had all the possession, but were unable to convert this to scores and a free from Rory Mason stretched Loughinisland\u0026rsquos lead to four.\u0026nbsp\n\nAmbrose Rogers pulled one back and Ireland, via a free, closed the gap to two.\n\nAs possession became vital and the fog closed in, the tension seemed to get to the attackers on both sides and a point from Declan mcClements and a free from Rory Mason was scant reward for such endeavour.\n\nLongstone piled on the pressure and points from Hughes, Trainor and Ireland left the minimum between the sides.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn a nail-biting conclusion to the game Rogers had the chance to send the game to extra-time when Longstone were awarded a free seven minutes into four minutes of added time, but his effort drifted wide and Loughinisland live to fight another day.\n\nLoughinisland 2-8\n\nLongstone 1-10\n\nMORGAN FUELS SFC\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ardian’s art exhibition in Newcastle  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA MAJOR sale of Irish art takes place at the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa this weekend.\n\nThe exhibition features the work of Adrian Margey who has been hailed as \u0026ldquoone of the rising starts of a new generation of Ulster artists.\n\nAdrian\u0026rsquos work is in high demand at home and overseas.\u0026nbsp This particular exhibition places a strong focus on the landscape and landmarks of Co Down and the Mournes area.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nAdrian has two distinct styles.\u0026nbsp One he labels as \u0026lsquotraditional\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash inspired in the main part by the Irish Impressionists.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe other he labels loosely as contemporary.\u0026nbsp It is characterised by bold colours and strong form which echo the aesthetics of modern living.\u0026nbsp This style makes reference to the Na\u0026iumlve School and Fauvism and has been influenced by time spent in South America.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nThis exhibition will celebrate the landscape and landmarks of Co Down and the Mournes.\n\nContemporary and traditional depictions of Murlough Bay, Newcastle, Annalong Harbour, St John\u0026rsquos Point, the Cooley Mountains, Rostrevor and Dundrum Bay will take centre stage.\n\nVisitors to this stunning new exhibition will also enjoy dramatic Belfast cityscapes and interpretations of the artist\u0026rsquos beloved North Coast.\u0026nbsp Representations of traditional Irish musicians and dancers will also be on show.\n\nAdrian will be in attendance all weekend to discuss his work and is now accepting commissions.\n\nOpening times are Friday, August 24, 6pm to 9pm Saturday, August 25 and Sunday, August 26, 11am to 8pm, and Monday, August 27, from 11am to 6pm.\n\nAdmission is free and everyone is welcome.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

Fortunately, on-one was injured.\n\nHowever, local people were puzzled that the nearby coastguard services did not promptly answer an emergency call and the incident led local councillor George Flinn to call for a review of rescue procedures.\n\nMr Flinn was given his answer this week in a frank letter from the coastguard service, which admitted there had been a 17-minute delay.\n\nHe was told in the letter, read to Down councillors, that the RNLI is currently reviewing the type of life craft and the methods used along the Down coastline and it will be taking into account the incident at Coney Island.\n\nThe letter pointed out that it was ironic that the coastguard had identified the Killough area as a likely accident spot on that day because of the water sports being held as part of the village\u0026rsquos festival weekend.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe failure of radio units meant they could not assist the young men in canoes at Coney Island. The unacceptable delay of 17 minutes has caused us concern, the letter stated.\n\nBut the letter ended by warning that people who disregard advice and put to sea in unstable craft in bad conditions usually preclude rescue attempts.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash Bulldozers moved in at the weekend to begin work in Newcastle\u0026rsquos new street widening scheme \u0026mdash and one of the first landmarks of the seaside resort to get the chop was the street wall at Central Promenade.\n\nThe scheme, which should eliminate Newcastle\u0026rsquos chic-a-bloc summer traffic jams, will take more than a year to complete.\n\nIn the meantime diversions and changes in traffic flow are in operation, the main change being at Bryansford Road, which will now carry two-way traffic, and at the main access to Donard Park, which will now become an exit only, with entry beside Patton\u0026rsquos Bridge.\n\nCASTLEWELLAN \u0026mdash A Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, has offered a \u0026pound200 reward in an all-out bid to catch the thieves who stole several thousand pounds from her on Saturday.\n\nA shocked Mrs Smyth told the Recorder that over \u0026pound5,000 worth of assorted furniture was taken and that she may have little chance of recovering it.\n\nThe burglary, described by Mrs Syth, as a \u0026ldquowell organised and large scale operation, occurred in the early hours when she was asleep at her home in Ballywillwill.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy husband and I were awakened by a notice outside.

In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly.

If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night.

The tower will be removed between November and April.\n\nFor many local people the dismantling work marks the end of an era.
