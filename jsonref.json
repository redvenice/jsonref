She\u0027s, just amazing.And with that he was sent home to enjoy the rest of his ketamine trip and in the sober meeting he had with Mary McAleese in the future she treated him like he was her biggest fan.However, we would not recommend taking ketamine at work, Seamus O’Reilly obviously had the luck of the Irish with him that day.Got my days wrong and ended up alone in a room with my boss and the President of Ireland while I was on ketamine.Way the gig worked, you’d either get Fri or Sat off. This week it was Fri, happy days. My manager, let’s call her Dympna, pipes up on the phone: “So, when you come in this evening, just a few things to remember”. I’m like, hold on Dympz, I’m off this eve, jog on. She corrects me.“Remember I said you could get all of Saturday off if you just worked 2 hours tonight?”. And of course THEN, I did suddenly remember, she’d said it to me as I was leaving the building and my conscious work brain was doing somersaults to get out of the place.She could have told me I was to have my foreskin tattooed with a harpoon and I would have given her a smile, thumbs up, and a flurry of yeps to get out of the place. I was eighteen. On minimum wage, and – bear in mind this is really saying something – my absolute minimum effort.All good. Except for the one thing.At that very moment, I was in a mate’s house on Dame St, relaxing with (I thought) nothing to do for the evening.Now you have to remember that, before dabbing and fortnite, kids used “drugs” to get high and I was, occasionally, adjacent to them.I was a fairly sheltered kid before college, and didn’t even drink til I was well into my late teens, never smoked even. I was very green. So too, coincidentally, was the homebrew ketamine that said pal was making IN HIS OVEN when I arrived.My pal had gotten it in liquid form and, for some reason, it had been dyed green – he has subsequently told me he thought it was a St Patrick’s Day promotion, and I’ve always thought it a charming entrepreneurial flourish on the part of his enterprising ketamine wholesaler.(Ketamine wholesalers are often vets, and the stuff originally for cats. People always say horse tranquiliser, either to make it sound more sordid or more badass, but ketamine is used on many animals, and vets have more use for cat tranqs than horses. Not quite as sexy is it?)Anyway, for want of a better idea, I took him up on his offer of a line of this thick, vaguely slightly clumpy bright green powder, knowing I had nothing else to do for the evening. Felt nothing. Had a tiny further bump 10 mins later. It was at this point that my phone rang.FLASHBACK ENDS, WE’RE BACK IN THE ROOM. So I’m definitely sweating after the call, not like instant come-up, more worried ABOUT the come-up. Never done this in my life, I’ve no idea how it’s going to feel. But, absent any other idea, I get my stuff together and head to work.On way to work, starts kicking in. You know when the roof of your mouth starts politely folding your brain in half, and your chest flutters like a cathedral filled with bees? I was holding it together but knew if I stopped concentrating for one second, I would become time itself.By the time I reach work (twenty mins later) I am sweating like microwaved bread, eyes on hinges, convinced my fingernails owe me money. I have an overwelming urge to yawn, just to get the memories out WHEN in comes Dympna with the rota for the evening.D: Thanks again, know it’s short- oh, you look a bit hot and bothered, did you run here ha?”D: Yes, Mary McAleese is in to see this season’s programme of events.My role is pretty weird, I have to stand in the corner and then every 15 mins, INTERRUPT this live-wire pair to offer them drinks, which protocol dictates they must refuse. I have barely processed any of this before I’m grabbing a tray and heading upstairs.The tray, btw, contains a white wine, a red wine, a G\u0026ampT, a whiskey, a rum and coke and some mineral waters. Always found that mix weird. Imagine the President of Ireland seeing the rum and coke and going “oooooh nice one, ta – now tell me about this Latvian choir again”.Right now I can hold it together when stimulated, when the adrenaline and fear is keeping me just ticking over – I’m weird but with it. Problem is, my job is now to stand silent and motionless in a room on my own until the President of Ireland arrives.Time passes on my own. Empires crumble and glaciers dissolve, stars die and oceans melt, out on the dusty planes of mother earth, hot bursts of young love gift the miracle of life children are born, raised, stricken infirm and die of old age.And then Mary McAleese walks in.By now, having been alone with my thoughts for the entire Cretaceous period, I am no longer mildly weird but deeply, extravagantly deranged. As the President of Ireland walks in, with my boss’s boss’s boss’s boss, my first impulse is to greet them like I own the place.It would be rude, surely, to not acknowledge their presence? Out of order even. Best thing to do would obviously be to say “hello guys” like it’s my home and I live there, in this big white room, where I stand in the corner, alone, holding a tray of drinks, like you do, at home.Anyway, by the ine grace of the infant Christ, they somehow do not hear me say this, and begin their itinerary round the room. I clench my entire head and focus on not shouting across the room to let them know that they should always feel at home here in this room of ours.I become extremely aware of my hands, and how I haven’t felt them in a very long time. They’re detuned to static , which would be worrying even if they weren’t holding a tray of drinks filled with noise and judgement. I hold no faith or creed other than “do not drop these plz”.Just when dropping everything seems to become less urgent, I realise it’s time to go over and offer these motherfuckers some fucken drinks, let’s get this party started woooooooI begin walking over to them and I move so abruptly that the glasses clink and they turn to look at me. I did this too fast. Now I’m thinking wooooah slow down there martina hingis, so I self-correct to a much slower speed. Watching my breath, nice and casual, you got this buddy.Guys. GUYS. Now, I’m moving far too slow. I started at this speed and I’m to embarassed to change and now it’s gonna take me like 5 mins to cross the room. They are watching me, frowning and sweaty, traversing the 5 foot between us like it’s a wooden plank on the Crystal Maze.I’m moving so slow my legs are cramping. I think they’re wondering why it’s taking me so long. It’s way harder than walking at normal speed. I’m shaking so the drinks are making noise again. For what feels like minutes.Anyway, I offer them the drinks and they say no.Do this another two times – how long was this presentation anyway, is this what the President does all day? Give her a brochure and a carryout ffs – and they say no. By the end, I’ve calmed down a bit in physical side (sweating, shaking) but I still feel completely batshit.At one point I clearly remember believing that my mind had escaped my body and was watching me hold the tray of drinks from the wallspace behind my head. Only out-of-body experience I’ve ever had.At the very end, they do accept a drink. It was at this point she spoke to me.Just some inane pleasantries, to which I reply with some off-the-hook pablum about work and college, at which point she says“Oh, is that a Northern accent I detect?”Dawgs, you know I’m down for the Nordie solidarity vibe, but this is the last thing I need right now.“Yeeerrrsh” I say, with a goalkeeper’s glove in my mouth. She starts talking about her experience coming down to study here, how it can be a real scenic change, but the making of you if you keep your eyes open to new experiences.I can tell she definitely means green ketamine.She’s a lovely woman, and very open and generous with her time, giving me ample space to answer her questions which I mostly do with sheepish, one-or-two-word answers. Finally, she asks me if Dublin is everything I thought it wou-Me: YES I LIKE IT I THINK IT’S GOODI’d been paying such fierce attention, I’d mis-timed my reply AND badly modulated my volume. She actually recoiled a little. I think the head of the venue actually stepped back and said “jesus!”.Mary McAleese flinched for what seemed like half a second, then flashed her best your-mum’s-sound-mate smile and replaced her white wine on my tray. The boss man nodded at me, they walked out of the room and I waited a few seconds before making my way downstairs to the kitchen.So at this point I’m thinking, wellll, I’m definitely fired but this will one day make a great story on an Nazi-riddled microblogging platform. I make my way to the staff area, wipe my sopping face and check my phone. I had only been in the room for 35 minutes.Dympna pads in all smiles, thanking me for my help at short notice. She sees that I’m a bit freaked and says, almost with a wink, “you could have told me you’d be like this, by the way”I’m thinking, of course, Dympna gets what’s up, it’s the service industry, people mistime their vibes, I bet this isn’t the first time she’s seen some-“I had no idea you were such a huge fan of Mary McAleese”I’m sorry what again was that did you meanThe boss man had indeed related the events upstairs to Dympna, but rather than a frightened waif hepped up on cat tranqs, he’d seen a political nerd deeply, irretrievably starstruck by contact with the 8th President of the Irish Republic, Mary McAleese.Presumably a political nerd with a gland problem, and low-grade artritis in both legs, and a tendency to welcome people into their workspaces, but a political nerd all the same.Me: Oh, yeah well, you know, it’s embarassing. She’s, just amazing.And you know what, she kinda is. She was always very nice to me each of the subsequent times we met – me doling out the drinks, her asking me how Dublin was getting on, all the while the other staff eyeing me to see how I was dealing with such close contact with my hero.I’d gurn and fret, play up to it when she’d be coming in, “oh what am I like”. I’d bat away suggestions I fancied her from the more ribald members of the changing room, and laugh along with the usual jibes, safe in the knowledge my nerdy affect had saved my bacon.So take ketamine at work, it’s great.MORE: How teachers are fighting to teach young students about mental health in primary schoolsMORE: This is what poor breeding for vanity can do to dogs"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kate-oates-e1525263167788.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"coronation street boss kate oates clarifies her exit decision reveals huge spoilers and addresses backlash","story":"(Picture: ITV)Coronation Street chief Kate Oates may have overseen a very busy era for the thriving soap – not only has it increased its episode output to six weekly editions and expanded its set, adding an entire new street – but ratings have increased massively and the reach to 16-34 year olds is the highest since 2006. No mean feat considering the competition from Netflix, catch-up TV and hundreds of channels. Her stay at the Street has not been without heavy discussion, with some questioning whether her approach to darker storytelling suits the show but there can be no denying that more people are watching than ever and she leaves the show in a much stronger state than she found it.As she heads on to pastures new and takes over prime time drama Bancroft, we sat down for a good chat with Kate about her time in the show, her final storylines coming up and also allowed her the chance to set the record straight on her departure and have her final thoughts on the ‘is Corrie too dark?’ debate.I was most nervous about what we talk about when we tackle a story like this – imitative behaviour which is someone doing it because they have seen it. I took some private, personal advice on that from a couple of friends who work in mental health.I also just had to think about my own experiences with my training with Samaritans. I also strongly believe that not talking about it isn’t working so I went through a whole process and had to think “how would I feel if…?” But I think it’s more important to raise the subject and try something else.Yeah, I’m all right about that side of things – I have gone from being very thin skinned to much thicker skinned! I have been asked by a researcher before appearing on Lorraine whether there were any low points to my time on the show and I thought “actually, no – without wishing to sound too twee about it, it all helps and it all counts and I will use it all in my career at some point”. I am very well supported – so many nice people have my back.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision(Picture: ITV)It kind of almost collided by accident to be honest – all of those issues with male mental health. Sometimes as a producer you would think “hang on, we’ve got a lot of stories that cover that vibe at the moment” – but that was a really good thing. We decided to cluster them and talk about it from all different angles because it is important and the figures are staggering and they are tragic.Things do need to change. I find it interesting that they are all different men with very different issues and approaches to life. Their support networks are all very different and in some cases those support networks work brilliantly and in others, people don’t know there is a problem.This is true to life. They all felt like natural character trajectories – the characters all held up to these journeys and as a theme for the show, it worked quite well.Not particularly – I still think it should be story led. With Donna in Emmerdale for example, when I spoke to Verity, she was brought back to play this final story – it was Ross’ and Marlon’s story really. Whenever you kill a character, it has to be more about the story that is left behind. For example, a character like Katie – Sammy is a brilliant actor who had been in the show for ages and also a really good friend – what that story gave was year’s worth of story for Robert and Aaron. Sammy had made the decision to go and it’s about what powers us forward – you always have to be thinking when you have six episodes to fill, what is going to drive that narrative.I was aware of the number but if I look at each of them inidually, I can justify every single one – I don’t think any of them were wasted deaths and all of the actors rose to the challenge. I have always worked with people who were gracious and generous – they always come in and do the job, even if it is challenging. There hasn’t been the same level of mortality in Weatherfield – but the key thing is about what it gives you afterwards. We’re not trigger happy, I promise – we always consider each death carefully.Yes. I suppose a way you could look at it is I could have completely avoided it if I wanted to – plenty of producers don’t want to get involved or talk to the press and that’s completely fine that’s their wand. In a social media society we live in, people always have an opinion on everything – sometimes the things I have responded to, I have got a dry sense of humour – sometimes when people are mean about me on Twitter, I have my own methods on how I might deal with that (laughs). But that’s just because that’s just how I respond to certain opinions.What I have been grateful for from the press is being able to have the chance to explain something or put something in context. In theory, drama shouldn’t have to explain itself because people watch it and it should exist on its own merit. But sometimes it’s nice to give context and explain where we are coming from and what we hope to achieve.It has been a bit of a surprise but I am very well supported and it has taught me a lot about resilience. I feel a little bit tougher that I did two years ago and that’s okay – I also understand that it’s part of the game I’m never necessarily playing a game but I do have a job to do and have to tell stories important to me and I know that others have to create their own careers off of that too.I think there will be a lot less interest in me and that’s no bad thing. I think it’s important to remember that out of the millions of Coronation Street viewers, the overwhelming majority haven’t got a clue who I am. There is a small percentage of people who do – most people don’t care and just care about the drama in front of them.With any drama, some people will immerse themselves and want to know all the IMDB credentials and some people couldn’t care less.When Iain MacLeod is here, he will have the same kind of thing I imagine and I am sure he will handle it brilliantly and I am looking forward to just concentrating on the script and the story. But as I say, sometimes it’s a luxury to be able to speak publicly and clarify things so it’s a double edged sword and I am very comfortable with that.Yes, you have to leave stuff in the story cupboard – I did that in Emmerdale with my team. The Ashley story was started under me but don’t forget, that was pitched by Maxine Alderton, that wasn’t my idea.Robron was also something I was able to leave and that’s something which grows which is fantastic. What I like about Iain and his work and why I’ll be interested in his work at Corrie – he did things with those stories that I wouldn’t have done.The Ashley point of view episode, I could watch that as a creative piece and think “hats off, I would never have thought of that”.I think that’s why he has succeeded with those stories and why I can watch him as a creative in his own right and think – “okay, that’s exciting!” I am sure he will do the same at Corrie. For my professional sensibilities, I want to leave good stuff and be proud when I go – don’t forget, my stuff will have my name on it ’til the autumn it’s my reputation and I care very deeply about that.But I care very deeply about the show as well and I have said before, you only look after these programmes for a period of time and then you hand them on.That is very much the job – if you just want to burn through stuff just to put your name on it, you won’t make many friends.MORE: Coronation Street’s male suicide story for Aidan Connor is a brave and necessary move that will save lives(Picture: ITV)I suppose all I would say is that I am sad that they were conflated because from my point of view and my bosses’ points of view, that genuinely wasn’t the case.Anyone who thinks that I pay too much attention to controversy hasn’t been paying much attention to the way I work and what I do. It’s pretty clear that I don’t cave easily and I love my job and I have been so privileged to do it. I genuinely don’t mind the stuff that comes out around it – it’s all part of the beast that is Coronation Street.I am really excited about the next job and I know that I will look back on this period of my life and be choked by how lucky I have been to do it. I come out feeling robust and hungry for the next thing.I love that soap can do that so I absolutely would work on soap again because I love the pace and I love how people talk about it. I feel very comfortable in it, I understand it, I like the people who work in it, I like the people who write about it – I just like it. So of course.One of the things I am most proud of is when you look at our reach of 16-34 year olds a couple of weeks ago around the big Phelan stuff, it was higher than it had been since 2006. That is pre Netflix, pre tablets and all of that kind of stuff – we have all of that competition now and yet it was still higher than in 2006. That makes me think, brilliant! The future of soap is just about people rising to the challenge – you’ve got to roll with the punches.When the network says, we want six a week – I left Emmerdale when it was doing seven a week – the figures were fantastic. So you go “all right, let’s do this. We need to have an extra meeting this week, we have to make sure these stories are at the top of their game. We have to justify it.” There is a side of it which means that people in my job – I don’t want to say burn out as that sounds negative – but reach the end of the process for themselves.Maybe that happens a little sooner but I think the shows are guarding against that – when you look at what Emmerdale is doing at the moment, there’s a couple of producers running it. Jane Hudson is incredible and I have worked with both Kate and Laura and they are amazingly talented, creative women.(Picture: ITV)That’s all about ensuring there is energy and creative ideas coming through all the time. The production side will have to evolve slightly, the writers will just have to keep bringing it and I think the viewers also have to allow the changes to happen organically but equally, we need to listen to their critique. It doesn’t just Teflon off me when people say it’s not funny or warm anymore or we miss this or that – we do really think about it and we try very hard.Those critiques have helped me through my whole process here and have been very valuable to me but I do think soap has a good future because I am leaving the show with the ratings in good form and higher than when I got here and when I get frustrated about negative press, that’s what I want to say – the ratings are higher, it’s sort of end of discussion, they’re the facts!If I was leaving the show with declining ratings, I might have given a different answer but I’m not – and I have enjoyed every moment. And there’s been such a great team around me, it’s not just me.Oh I thought you meant when I “snapped” at Holly! My boyfriend was sitting at home saying “that’s not Kate snapping!” (laughs). Well, Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby are coming in for a bit of fun and part of Helen Flanagan’s exit story.We’re kind of replaying a bit of a trick we have used before because Rosie has already been on shows but it will be great comedy.Phil and Holly will play themselves – I had a couple of hopes where I thought I could get them to slightly play against type! They’re such good sports – I am very happy. That’s the benefit of being in a big production company like ITV – I know Emma Gormley who runs daytime – she’s an amazing, successful person and a good friend of mine so I was able to give her a ring and she said: “yeah, that sounds fun!”I would love that! I think he would kick ass.(Picture: ITV)We have some amazing stuff with Jim McDonald. He’s going to be coming back with a lot of resentment because of what Steve did – from his point of view, he has been rotting in prison and no one cares. We also played a story 18 months ago where it seemed like Steve might have inherited a genetic disease from his dad but no one went to see Jim to ask if he was okay. We have a great story to play with that.Things get massive for the Metcalfes – they will be big right up until Christmas. I can’t promise they will still be the Christmas story as Iain is taking over from me but they have huge material for them that will see Tim and Sally at their best.We have Lewis – king of cads! He is returning – I would have him for as long as Nigel Havers would want to stay as he works brilliantly with Sue Nicholls and I love that existing dynamic that he played both mother and daughter. It’s perfect and I love everything that they have done with Sophie Thompson as none of them have overplayed it.I was anxious about that story as it’s about a medium talking about Richard Hillman. If you are going to tell that truthfully, you have a woman whose husband was a serial killer, then you have a stranger coming in but you’re playing it for laughs – how can you expect Helen Worth to play that honestly? But the writers were brilliant and were able to unfold it so it feels very truthful in the moment and we will just spin it in a bit of a different way after that. Sophie does everything with integrity – she was perfect for it.We also have Steve and Tracy – you’ve got to love it. I see them as a bit of a fiery Jack and Vera. They fit into old school Corrie but they are not old school actors – they are fresh with it. Kate Ford benefits from a much more rounded type of storytelling. She is fantastic.  When you look back at the layers she has played alongside Deirdre, Blanche, Amy, Steve and so many other relationships, there is such depth to this character. We can still see the darker side of Tracy, she’s still a superbitch – but a much more believable one.(Picture: ITV)I always liked their reunion. I didn’t always have Steve and Tracy in my head – it came about later in the day – but I always had it in my head that Steve and Michelle couldn’t see out his indiscretion. His thing with Leanne was a story I inherited – it gave me lots of mileage. What we played was Michelle losing that child and then the truth coming out – and what happens after that? Kym and Simon work brilliantly together but I just don’t believe she would forgive him after that – the dynamic needed to break up because of that and we had to go with something else. I can’t pretend that Steve and Tracy was my game plan from the start but it has grown and I think it works.Again, I probably refer back to my earlier comment about not being afraid of controversy – it’s more important to reflect the truth. If you tie things up with a bow, there’s a danger people take away from that: “it’s all right then, we don’t need to talk about this anymore, it’s done.” But it’s not done. There are lots of things within that story that we couldn’t show on screen. If I were going to show that story in court, I’d have been fascinated to have played the truth of it – I hope he doesn’t mind me name dropping here but I am really good friends with (Judge) Robert Rinder and I talked to him about the story and he spoke to me about how he might cross-examine someone on the stand or how someone else might.Rob is a massive supporter of the storyline – he’s a great friend and sounding board. Duncan Craig from Survivors Manchester did the same when he took us through the kinds of questions someone might be faced with on the stand. It’s hard and it’s brutal and you question whether we are set up in the best place to get these convictions? If it were a 9pm drama and we saw David Platt on the stand talking about what had happened to him, a barrister might cross examine him with a huge level of detail to try and discredit him – it is really intimate and makes you think “I never thought about it that way and how it could be spun”.I think it’s important not to artificially tie things up – I believe that David’s perpetrator wouldn’t be convicted in this instance. David got rid of all of the evidence. We will have to tie the storyline off – it will find an ending which will surprise people. David will get a catharsis and some acknowledgement but he might not get that legally. In soap, a lot of the justice often comes from the community – Phil Collinson used to call it the court of Coronation Street and I completely get that.(Picture: ITV)I can say that Phelan was biblical on those sea walls – he imposes his own biblical imagery and there is definitely that in his exit. We have collided stories like we did last May with Who Pushed Ken, Bethany’s story and Nick’s exit. We’re doing that again – they’re the richest stories for me. It’s difficult in these set weeks when there’s one event and everything else feels like you are just waiting for the moment – Connor gives it his all as always it’s such a good week, I’m proud of it.That’s a great question to end on but also the hardest. In a way, it all passes in a blur – it’s so busy. Without wanting to sound twee, it’s such an incredible experience – there aren’t many people as privileged to have done what I have been doing. If you had asked me ten years ago if I’d be doing this job, I’d have laughed and hidden and not thought it were possible – I’m so lucky. I feel incredibly lucky and I look back on it with nothing but fondness – even the challenging bits.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/954573250.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david haye just ten pounds heavier tony bellew rematch","story":"Tony Bellew and David Haye weigh in ahead of Saturday (Picture: Getty)A lean David Haye weighed in just ten pounds heavier than Tony Bellew for their rematch.Haye was almost a stone heavier than Bellew for their previous encounter 14 months ago, but tipped the scales at 15st 10lbs 2oz (220lbs) ahead of their second encounter.Bellew too was aiming to be lighter for the showdown and he weighed in at 15st 4oz (210lbs).Bellew and Haye enjoyed an amicable final face-off compared to the melee at yesterday’s press conference.There were no punches thrown this time, but there were plenty of words exchanged as Haye hurled insults at a smiling Bellew."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10363174.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"kendall jenner frees nipple rocks lace dress swanky tiffany party","story":"Kendall Jenner opted for a see-through dress (Picture: Getty)Kendall Jenner rocked a see-through dress as she headed out in New York.The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star looked incredible as she attended the launch of Tiffany \u0026amp Co.’s Paper Flowers jewellery collection – freeing the nipple in a white mini-dress.And she was joined by some famous faces for the lavish bash, including Cara Delevingne and rumoured girlfriend Paris Jackson.But, while eyes may have been on Kendall’s slightly transparent dress, or those very see-through heels, we have some serious questions about her mini handbag.Kendall looked incredible in the risque outfit (Picture: Getty)Like, what do you even put inside it?And where do you keep your phone, gum, lipstick, and Oyster Card?Kylie Jenner’s sister recently made headlines after opening up about her sexuality, putting all those rumours about her dating life to bed once and for all.Speaking to Vogue, the 22-year-old explained whether she identifies as gay or bi, explaining: ‘I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know!

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.          Pictured: The rear view of York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk complete with conservatory\u0027It\u0027s not too late!\u0027 Meghan Markle\u0027s brother Thomas pens...Royal Wedding: The American traditions Meghan Markle will be...Share this articleThere were not enough bathrooms and nobody had an en-suite. Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/10/4BD80ABD00000578-0-image-m-8_1525425832384.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":null,"title":"Starbucks new Frappuccinos alarming calorie count","story":"David Haye\u0026#8217s net worth revealed ahead of Bellew v Haye fightTony Bellew\u0026#8217s net worth revealed ahead of Bellew v Haye rematchLast Man Standing: Fox in talks to revive Tim Allen\u0027s ABC comedy showRoyal Wedding condoms revealed ahead of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s big dayHow to change your Twitter passwordWho are Sam and Mark?

The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/28/16/05CC4332000003E8-5444853-Theresa_May_and_Jean_Claude_Juncker_agreed_the_outline_of_a_divo-a-6_1519834166574.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

The images were captured by eight New York Times photographers who worked for the parks department while on strike from the newspaper. Photographer Paul Hosefros captured the above image of a boy sucking his thumb while sitting on a platform at an abandoned ing area at Red Hook Pool in 1978          New York City Parks Director and Curator of Art and Antiquities Jonathan Kuhn told DailyMail.com that the images were never published and it\u0027s unclear what their purpose was going to be. Photographer Neal Boenzi captured the above image of a man roasting a pig inside what\u0027s believed to be Brooklyn\u0027s Prospect Park          Kuhn has selected 65 images for an exhibit titled, \u00271978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project\u0027, at Central Park\u0027s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018. Photographer Gary Settle captured the above image of young kids playing on a jungle gym inside what\u0027s believed to be Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens          Kuhn spoke with five of the six living photographers and most of them vaguely remember the project because they\u0027ve taken thousands of photos during their lengthy careers. Photographer Neal Boenzi snapped the above image showing young women walking on the splintered boardwalk at South Beach on Staten Island          \u0027When I probed them about their methods of photography, they\u0027re looking for that unexpected moment of surprise, of unguardedness, and so that\u0027s also what interested me about these pictures,\u0027 Kuhn told DailyMail.com. Photographer Paul Hosefros captured this image showing a group of boys flexing their muscles at Coney Island in BrooklynKuhn has selected 65 images for an exhibit titled, ‘1978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project’, which will be held at Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018.Of the historic discovery, Kuhn told DailyMail.com that it ‘was clear the artistic value was high’ with the images which were captured by Neal Boenzi, D. Gorton, Eddie Hausner, Paul Hosefros, Bob Klein, Larry Morris, Gary Settle and Joyce Dopkeen, who was the first woman hired as photographer for The New York Times. \u0027These were really top notch photojournalists who were combining a sort of documentary sort of feel but were also sort of combining artistic sensibility. The photos are all color which is good because, I suppose the predominant motive of photographing at that time would have been black and white,\u0027 Kuhn said.It\u0027s unclear how long they worked for the Parks Department or how much they were paid. Kuhn spoke with five of the six living photographers and most of them vaguely remember the project because they\u0027ve taken thousands of photos during their lengthy careers.\u0027When I probed them about their methods of photography, they\u0027re looking for that unexpected moment of surprise, of unguardedness, and so that\u0027s also what interested me about these pictures,\u0027 he said.\u0027Sometimes they\u0027re using telephoto, sometimes their subjects clearly knew they were being filmed, in which case they used their seasoned photo journalists who could gain the rapport of their subjects.\u0027But more often than not, they are capturing them without their knowledge so there\u0027s a sense of real use.\u0027           \u0027I\u0027ve always been intrigued by how parks represent our society at large. You know, I guess the subways are another venue where everyone is brought together in a different way, but in these pictures clearly represent to some extent a revolving demographic of New York. But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity,\u0027 Kuhn added. The above image shows the Fiesta Folklorica at the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, Manhattan. This is one image in the collection where it\u0027s unclear which photographer captured this historic moment          Joyce Dopkeen, the first woman hired as a photographer for The New York Times, captured the above image of park revelers at park in the Bronx. For years she worked as the only female photographer for the newspaper          The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park. Photographer Gary Settle captured the above image showing a woman happily holding her shoes while walking in the water at the Unisphere inside Flushing Meadows Corona Park in QueensThe New York City Parks and Recreation Department employs their own staff photographers who go out each day and capture images inside the city\u0027s parks. But those images are \u0027more official and show construction or playgrounds or openings and so forth,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So these images from the Times photographers are very different,\u0027 he added. \u0027I\u0027ve always been intrigued by how parks represent our society at large. You know, I guess the subways are another venue where everyone is brought together in a different way, but in these pictures clearly represent to some extent a revolving demographic of New York. But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity.\u0027Some are obvious and common, like people swimming at the beach, some are less common like cricket or a guy roasting a whole pig – which by the way is not a legal thing to do in the park.\u0027The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park.          Kuhn noted: \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978.\u0027 Photographer D. Gorton captured the above image of a boy petting a cat during the Cats on Parade inside the Central Park Mall in Manhattan          Photographer Paul Hosefros snapped this image of two boys playing handball at Seven Gables Playground in Queens          Photographer Paul Hosefros captured the above image of a young woman resting after swimming at Red Hook Pool in Brooklyn          Photographer Ed Hausner captured the above image showing a family trying to salvage a picnic table inside of an unidentified park One of the many captivating images in the exhibit shows a little boy barefoot and sitting on an abandoned ing board at an empty pool in Red Hook.\u0027The pool is filled with liter, wood and debris and this boy climbed up onto the ing platform barefoot, which I don\u0027t think we would let someone do this today,\u0027 Kuhn stated.\u0027Clearly this picture tells you a lot. It\u0027s saying that this place was no longer fulfilling its function, it\u0027s telling you that there was no body minding the pool at the time and that they let a young kid in. And yet he\u0027s sort of there sucking his thumb in this poignant picture.\u0027 Other images show women in their swimsuits walking along a boardwalk, children playing on a playground, teen boys running while playing handball and more. \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So the narrative I saw with the images though starkly was that here\u0027s this year considered one of the worst in the city\u0027s fiscal history, in terms of it\u0027s ability to manage itself, and yet people are still joyful in many of the pictures and engaging actively with their parks. \u0027Sort of creating a sense of that they are essential no matter what.\u0027 1978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project will be on show at Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"Six story deep sinkhole length two football fields opens New Zealand cow farm","story":"A sinkhole the length of two football fields and the depth of a six-story building has opened up on a New Zealand farm  A worker stumbled upon the chasm before dawn when he was rounding up cows for milking on the farm near the North Island town of RotoruaHe says the area often develops sinkholes due to degrading limestone rock beneath the ground\u0027s surface.GNS Science volcanologist Brad Scott told Newshub the sinkhole was three times larger than any he\u0027d seen before. He says an underground cavity would have developed over decades.Tremain says he\u0027s planning to install a fence so livestock don\u0027t fall into the sinkhole.

Why would you do that to an animal,\u0027 said David Hamilton, who opted to walk up the steps with his wife Diana after disembarking from the 2,550-passenger MSC Musica, on a seven-day round trip from Venice.\u0027We are shocked to see this happening. We didn\u0027t think for a second about riding a donkey up steep steps, it is so unfair on them.\u0027          Donkeys line up to climb a steep section of stairs with the tourists on their backs during what can be ten-hour shifts          Some donkeys carry tourists up the cobbled steps while others rest on the side of the path in Santorini          A group of donkeys wait behind a barrier as they stand ready to be called for another tiring journey up the steps           Some tourists chose to walk instead of subjecting the donkeys to the long climb up the steps on the island of Santorini          One of the tourists sits on the back of a donkey as it makes its way up the steps during one of its eight to ten-hour shifts          A donkey carrying a tourist and her baggage turns a corner as it climbs up the steep and difficult steps in Santorini          A tourist poses for a picture with one of the donkeys which carries them up the steps towards the town of FiraEfforts by the UK charity, the Donkey Sanctuary, and local animal welfare groups have won some improvements for the animals but, despite mounting pressure - including TripAdvisor comments branding it barbaric and archaic - a ban on the donkey trade seems distant.Friends Caroline Tiernan-Locke and Cassandra Douglas instantly regretted being persuaded to take the donkey ride.\u0027We were in the harbour and went to have a look at the donkeys and they literally hustled us into a line and onto the donkeys before we realised what was happening. We immediately knew it was wrong,\u0027 said Caroline, a 33-year-old marketing manager from Bristol.\u0027I just had this feeling I\u0027d done something wrong all the way up. I didn\u0027t realise how long the journey was and it must be terrible for those poor animals to do it day in, day out, through the summer. I wish I\u0027d done more research about it then could have avoided it.\u0027But they are very skilled at getting you into the line and saying it\u0027s only a ten-minute trip but it took more like 20 minutes and the donkeys looked very unhappy.

It was horrible. The donkey in front of me buckled and went down and the guy was just screaming at it to get moving again. He didn\u0027t seem to care about the animal at all.\u0027 Santorini has turned its donkeys into a money-spinning feature. Soft toys, t-shirts and trinkets bearing donkey motifs are sold in gift shops at the top of the steps and around the main town of Fira, the island\u0027s capital. The island brews signature yellow and red donkey beers and donkey riding tours are marketed in travel agencies.But there has been growing animal welfare concerns and in 2017 German tourist Susan Chopin was trampled to death after one of the donkeys bolted and charged into tourists who were walking up the steps. The 67-year-old, who was on a cruise with her husband and another couple, had just celebrated her birthday.The animals who walk up in lines of two to ten, offload at a \u0027donkey station\u0027 just before the summit of the steps and then return for their next load, often bumping into walkers or squeezing them into walls that look over steep drops.Santorini, which stretches to 77 square kilometres and has a population of 25,000, has grown in popularity to the point where Mayor Nikolos Zorzos has limited the number of cruise ship passengers that can disembark to 8,000 a day from a peak of 18,000 in 2016 because of over-crowding.           The Donkey Sanctuary charity paid for cloth screens to create shade for the donkeys at the top of the walk          A group of tourists, some of them carrying bags, make their way up the island of Santorini on the donkeys\u0027 backs          A pair of tourists wearing sunglasses are pictured with the donkeys carrying fellow visitors to the island in the background          Some tourists criticised the practice after visiting the Greek island with one choosing to walk and saying it was \u0027cruel\u0027          The donkeys and the tourists on their backs leave the sea far below them as they climb the 520 wearying steps          Cruise ships are pictured in the background on the shore of the island of Santorini where people ride donkeys on the steps          Some of the donkey merchandise is pictured with the name Santorini on soft toys sold at a gift shop"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/17/4BBFD92400000578-5691875-image-m-39_1525451670364.jpg","title":"U S judge questions special counsels powers Manafort case","story":"    Tense hearing: Judge T.S.

MailOnline has approached Vatican and Saudi authorities for comment but they have not yet responded. Saudi Arabia\u0027s anti-extremism Etidal centre hosted Cardinal Tauran last month as the crown prince pushes for inter-religious exchange in the ultra-conservative Sunni kingdom.There are no Christian churches in Saudi Arabia, the only country in the region without one. The Vatican has previously spoken of its wish to provide the Christian population of Saudi Arabia with the ability to worship. Campaigners win the right to launch a fresh legal bid to...Army Green Berets have been helping Saudi Arabian-led...Share this articleDuring the visit earlier this year Riyadh-based Etidal, the Arabic acronym for the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, discussed with the cardinal its use of media and technology to \u0027disrupt extremist recruitment and promote tolerance\u0027, a government statement said.\u0027I think we have two enemies: extremism and ignorance,\u0027 Tauran was quoted as saying in the statement, while lauding the centre that was established in 2017.\u0027I don\u0027t believe in the clash of civilisation but rather in the clash of ignorance. Most of the time people react because they don\u0027t know who you are or who they are.\u0027Tauran, seen as an energetic promoter of dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and Islam, also met Saudi King Salman in the capital.

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/14/4BD8735900000578-0-image-m-18_1525438847174.jpg","title":"Royal wedding George Charlotte expected page boys flower girls","story":"Put your princess in a pretty as a petal dress like Charlotte in Little Alice LondonClick to check it out!Prince George and Princess Charlotte were pictured making their way inside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary\u0026#39s hospital with dad William, ready to meet their new baby brother.Charlotte was her usual excitable self as she arrived at the hospital waving to the cameras and she looked adorable in a blue dress by Little Alice London.

Elderly New York society doyennes walked through the collection with private guides, stopping for a second to admire the Monets and Picassos, as tour groups crowded by the ornate porcelains and decorative arts, ning centuries and continents, craning their heads to catch a glimpse.But then, this is no ordinary collection, and it will certainly be no ordinary auction.Spread across three floors of Christie’s salerooms is the sprawling private collection of David Rockefeller, the billionaire banker and globetrotting philanthropist who died last year at 101. The last surviving grandchild of the oil magnate and America’s first billionaire John D Rockefeller, David Rockefeller spent much of his life collecting exceptional works of modern art, which will now be sold to raise money for the family’s preferred charitable causes.Branded as a once-in-a-generation chance for global collectors to buy some of the world’s most significant pieces still in private collection, some predict the auction, which will take place over three days next week, could be the first to raise $1bn in total.“This is not just a New York event,” said Jonathan Rendell, Christie’s deputy chairman. “It’s a world event. It is an exceptional sale.”Among the collection’s highlights include Picasso’s Fillette à la corbeille fleurie (Young Girl with a Basket of Flowers), one of the finest portraits of his rose period. The painting had hung in the living room of Rockefeller’s grand Manhattan home on the Upper East Side for decades. He bought it from the estate of Gertrude Stein in 1968, meaning the painting has only had two owners. It was described in Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast, the memoir of the author’s time in 1920s Paris, as hanging in Stein’s Left Bank apartment.The piece is expected to sell for over $100m.Also on sale is Monet’s Nymphéas en fleur (Water Lilies in Bloom), an important work in the artist’s series of water garden paintings. The work is distinguished by the fact that all the lilies are in full bloom, and was brought to New York after Rockefeller, with his wife Peggy, who died in 1996, purchased it from a dealer in Paris in 1956. The painting had hung at the couple’s Hudson Pines estate in Sleepy Hollow, near the bottom of grand, winding staircase, and is estimated to sell for between $50m and $70m.The collection also includes a number of works from American artists including Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe and Willem de Kooning – most of them valued at over seven figures. Diego Rivera’s masterwork The Rivals, painted in 1931 in a makeshift studio aboard the steamship that brought him and Frida Kahlo to New York, will also be on sale – valued at up to $7m.“Encountering the quality of these paintings has been a fantastic journey for all of us,” Rendell said. But even among these eye-watering estimates there is a sense that Christie’s has veered on the conservative side. Following the $450m sale of a painting by Leonardo Da Vinci at the end of last year, a price that shattered auction records, some predict the auction’s banner items will go for much higher than the estimated price.Rendell would not be drawn on the issue. “I will wait until next week and then I’ll say if it was a conservative estimate. This week, the estimate is what the estimate is,” he said.While the greatest monetary value lies in Rockefeller’s modern art, the collection extends to an array of extraordinary artefacts, from a dinner service Napoleon took with him into exile on the island of Elba in 1814, to a 13th-century Syrian incense burner unique in that it has Christian and Islamic decoration. The burner had sat on Rockefeller’s desk until his death.The Rockefellers purchased many of the pieces over their decades of collecting for relatively small prices, only to see the valuation balloon in recent years as the market surged.Nonetheless, in a bid to keep the sale as accessible as possible, hundreds of items, including costume jewellery and furniture, are being placed in an online auction where bidding starts as low as $100.To many in the art world, next week’s auction marks the end of an era. Rockefeller, who had long pledged to sell his entire collection and donate the proceeds to a group of chosen charities, was the last in a line of tycoon collectors whose primary mission was to patronise the arts through their purchases.“It was the stagecraft of his life,” said Evan Beard, national art services executive at US Trust, Bank of America’s private wealth management ision. “But the folks who will be buying a lot of this material will be a new breed of collector, where they have at least one eye on the financial component. Art for them is an extension of their financial life.”Beard said he represented a number of buyers planning to bid on some of the most lucrative items in the catalogue. A group of which were hedge fund managers, “trophy hunting clients”, aiming to put together some of the great private collections in the world.“Many of these folks think of themselves as the next generation. So you’ll see some bidding just because of the cultural capital that is contained within these works,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6476f63dd33daa7361670359b2e034bf96f7593/0_94_2999_1799/master/2999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=037836eb78f824721aa2846d7082b032","title":"bold and bored the 1960s american dream in pictures mario carnicelli","story":"Fashion students, flashing signage and queuing punters make up peripatetic Italian photographer Mario Carnicelli’s take on the US"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0009a08d6911faf332e69d04208959b9c52c5ce7/14_155_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=300e56930ad572041e51ca5a2383524f","title":"the end of the french intellectual by shlomo sand review","story":"The quality of French intellectual life has plummeted, argues an author who targets such recent media stars as Michel Houellebecq and Alain Finkielkraut On 16 November 1980, Louis Althusser strangled his wife at the elite École Normale Supérieure in Paris. The Marxist philosopher was never arrested for the crime but instead spent four years at the Sainte-Anne hospital. Why? According to Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, such was French deference to its intellectuals that the establishment, including the justice minister and ENS alumnus Alain Peyrefitte, ignored the law. The supposition was simply not allowed “that a philosopher of Althusser’s status could have deliberately committed a murder so he had to be automatically considered mentally unbalanced”.Twenty years earlier, Jean-Paul Sartre benefited from similar attitudes. In 1960, the existentialist called on French soldiers to refuse to fight in Algeria’s war of independence. In response to those demanding Sartre’s prosecution, President de Gaulle said: “You do not arrest Voltaire.”For those of us who live on the other side of the Channel, French regard for intellectuals is puzzling. If, say, Germaine Greer had strangled her partner, or Richard Dawkins had incited fellow atheists to burn mosques and churches, you would suspect, they would be detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure, albeit with fat advances for their prison memoirs. Why the difference? Sand suggests anglophone anti-intellectualism is Protestantism’s legacy: since we got rid of Catholicism’s clerical hierarchy, we’ve been loth to replicate that authority with its secular counterpart. France’s intellectuals, by contrast, “have inherited both the role of the court jester, able to say whatever was in their minds without being punished, and of the priest, serving as intermediary between the believer and ine truth”.Sand starts his history with the Dreyfus affair and ends it, nauseated, in 2015, as the French establishment marches in solidarity with murdered workers at Muslim-baiting magazine Charlie Hebdo and there are calls for Michel Houellebecq to be inducted into the Académie Française for his novel Submission (one that imagines France busted down to a mere province of a Mediterranean caliphate). “The modern Parisian intellectual was born in the battle against Judeophobia, the twilight of the intellectual in the early 21st century is happening under the sign of a rise in Islamophobia,” Sand argues.Though many books have been written about the decline of the French intellectual, Sand’s is a welcome addition since it is written, not by a navel-gazing insider, but by someone by turns seduced and revolted by that Gallic neologism, les intellocrates. Now a professor of history in Tel Aviv, Sand started his working life making radio sets in Israel before studying in France and his blue-collar past haunts his thinking. His early scholarly work was on French syndicalist Georges Sorel, for whom workplace self-organisation was key to socialist revolution. Sand inherits his doubts that workers need to be led to communist paradise by soft-handed Left Bank scribblers.But first, when Sand read Albert Camus, Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, he was seduced. “I was bowled over by the romantic levity of those who lived from writing, by the idealisation of this intellectual commitment in the service of just causes, and against the enchanting backdrop of the City of Light.”Later, he was revolted. He came to believe that De Beauvoir and Sartre’s pro-Jewish posturing after the war was born of bad conscience for doing nothing effective to fight nazism or help Jews. Indeed, during the Nazi occupation, De Beauvoir signed a form denying she was a Jew in order to keep teaching at a lycée, while both she and Sartre neglected their former lover, Bianca Lamblin, a Polish Jew who holed up from the Gestapo in the south of France for the duration of the war. Sand snarls: “The ardent discussions on authenticity and existentialism in the cafes of Saint-Germain-des-Près left them no time to take an interest in the existential experience of their abandoned and persecuted lover, whose grandfather and aunt were murdered in the camps.”De Beauvoir’s Jewish lover Claude Lanzmann, too, gets indicted for his 1985 documentary Shoah. The film invites you to believe, Sand argues, “that the persecution of Jews (and of Jews alone) only took place east of the Rhine, and particularly in Poland, a country so ‘unintellectual’ and ‘antisemitic’”. The Jews interned by the French authorities at Drancy on their way to Auschwitz did not figure in Lanzmann’s portrait of the Holocaust, one that, for Sand at least, “so well agreed with the image that Parisian literati wanted to give of themselves”.What Sand’s book lacks, despite its refreshing absence of deference, is a sense of what made French intellectual production since the war so compelling. Lévi-Strauss, Barthes, Kristeva, Lacan, Derrida, Cixous, Deleuze and Guattari are scarcely mentioned and Foucault only gets a cameo. The Maoist philosopher Alain Badiou once told me that, while British postwar philosophy has its “côté somnifère” (its soporific aspect), French intellectual life in the same period has been a wild adventure. I’d like to read that adventure story, but Sand doesn’t tell it.Instead, he explores the embarrassing truth that, while in the new millennium the quality of French intellectual life has plummeted, its reputation remains. He bracingly compares media-friendly intellectuals such as Houellebecq, Éric Zemmour and Alain Finkielkraut to Nazi-collaborating writers such as Robert Brasillach and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle. Like such past figures, Sand argues, they cling to a France that is “totally imaginary” and yearn for it to be purified of the Other. In 1940 that meant Jews, in 2018 Islam.For Finkielkraut, author of The Unhappy Identity, the collapse of France’s educational system and high culture explain his homeland’s decline: “We no longer teach that the colonial project also sought to educate, to bring civilisation to savages,” he wrote. For Zemmour, author of The French Suicide, the problem is France has become too feminised, hedonistic and inidualistic. For both, as for Houellebecq, into France’s decadent vacuum steps the scary Other in the form of the racist projection of their own fears – the macho, barbaric Islamist bent on destroying everything French intellectuals, ostensibly, have held dear.Perhaps it takes an outsider Jew to diagnose the sickness of French intellectual life. Near the end of the book, Sand looks at a cartoon of Muhammad published in Charlie Hebdo, “a cruel-looking bearded figure wrapped in a white jellaba, his eyes hidden and holding a long pointed knife”. He has seen that image before. Where? In the Jew-hating cartoons published in the 1890s in La Libre Parole to whip up antisemitic sentiment during the Dreyfus affair. “It is surprising to see how much the ‘Semitic’ Jews of the past resemble the ‘Semitic’ Muslims of today: the same ugly face and the same long and fat nose.”No wonder, then, that when some 4 million French people joined the march for Charlie Hebdo’s murdered court jesters three years ago, Sand was not one of them. He is not the kind of guy to sport a “Je suis Charlie” badge – his admiration for French intellectuals, such as it is, does not extend to self-identifying with Islamophobes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695f1a455396a5a4404759148c7c4e38bf06d7c6/16_144_3948_2370/master/3948.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2821a77280e14c0b7d066fbff16c1829","title":"balearic islands bank on sun to kickstart power drive renewables","story":"Local government wants to convert totally to renewables by 2050 but plan will not be easyAs thousands of holidaymakers fly into Menorca this summer, a glance out the window will illustrate the past and future of the island’s energy system.In the picturesque harbour of the capital, Mahón, where cruise ships dock alongside a marina full of luxury yachts, sits a pollution-belching, oil-fired power station inaugurated by Gen Franco more than half a century ago.On the other side of this Mediterranean isle lies row upon row of solar panels, tucked between traditional dry-stone walls.The Balearics, like many islands, are overwhelmingly reliant on costly, dirty fossil fuel imports for power, heat and transport. Wind, hydro and solar power provide about a third of Spain\u0027s electricity needs. Renewables grew rapidly in the country during the noughties but installations crashed in the face of government policy changes between 2012 and 2015. Retrospective changes to some schemes also put off investors. But the government held two auctions of renewable subsidies in 2017, which were mostly won by windfarms and solar projects, which are due to come online by 2020. Spain is second only to Germany in Europe for installed wind power capacity.Francina Armengol, the president of the Balearic government, said: “It’s not a political act, we haven’t done it to win votes. We believe it’s the right thing.”Large new car parks – the islands have some of the highest car ownership levels in Spain – will be ordered to fit solar power. New diesel cars will be banned from 2025, electric cars will be supported by charging points and street lights will be switched to LEDs.It will not be an easy transition. There are local and national obstacles to this vision. While the governments in the Balearics and Madrid, together with the tourist industry, energy companies, unions and ecologists are publicly agreed on the end destination, there are disagreements over the timetable.Citing energy security, Madrid has rejected the Balearic government’s proposal to gradually close the sizeable Es Murterar coal power station in Mallorca and fill the gap with existing gas capacity.Endesa, the company that runs coal, gas and oil plants on the islands, has suggested a compromise, with Es Murterar being mothballed but not dismantled. Some of the station’s 300 workers are unconvinced, despite promises of retraining and new job opportunities in the renewables business. “There will be no light and no jobs,” said one employee during a break outside the plant, which is adjacent to a natural park and only a few minutes’ walk behind the hotels and sandy beach of Alcudia Bay in the north-east of the island.There are also significant local challenges to the obvious alternative of more solar power.Residents have campaigned against solar projects because they are a blot on the landscape and because solar firms want agricultural land. As Marc Pons, the Balearic government’s energy minister, admits: “There is a lot of sensitivity in rural areas.”The main conservation group in Mallorca – GOB Mallorca – welcomes small solar schemes, especially on rooftops, but the spokesperson Margalida Ramis said it opposes large-scale solar farms that “are not about community but profit”.Scale, however, is necessary to make solar economics work here and to overcome other local challenges – such as land-leasing, which costs five times more than on the mainland.Jordi Quer, who runs a solar firm in Mallorca, is frustrated but determined. “We are just waiting for a solar industry here,” he said.In the meantime, local government is trying to kickstart the industry. Solar arrays have been fitted on scores of public buildings, from schools to hospitals. A further hurdle is the Balearics’ regulated energy market. The islands’ fossil fuel power station operators receive a €250-300m annual subsidy to compensate them for keeping residential energy prices the same as on the mainland. Solar park owners do not.Teresa Ribera, a former Spanish climate minister, said the use of public money should be an argument for “the best and cleanest options, not to waste the money in dirty options”.In Menorca, there are some more hopeful signs. Mahon’s oil power station is expected to switch to cleaner gas within two or three years. Conxa Junalola, the town’s mayor, said residents were “very worried” about the impact on their health from burning oil.While there is a core of local people opposing the solar park, which still awaits permission from Madrid for a grid connection, it is backed by the island’s influential green group. GOB Menorca wants to see more big solar farms, adapted to the landscape.And it is not only islanders calling for more renewables. Research by the tour operator Tui, a major presence on the islands, shows holidaymakers want hoteliers to use renewable energy.Madrid, which is believed to prefer expanding renewables on the mainland and upgrading undersea cables to export more of it to the Balearics, insisted it was not blocking the islands’ green plan. Talks between the Balearics and national government had been described as “productive”. Spain was advancing more renewables and decarbonising its energy system, an energy ministry spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"labour fudge brexit local elections leave remain corbyn","story":"It’s the May bank holiday weekend, and all is just as tradition demands. The sun is shining, the local election results are in, and Ken Livingstone is on the television talking about Hitler. To complete the spring picture, partisans and pundits are out in force, frantically spinning or interpreting the results of last night’s council contests in England, hoping to ine what the votes in 150 local authority areas portend for the nation’s future.So Tories can celebrate that not only did they hold on in key London boroughs that had seemed vulnerable, they also made gains outside the capital, from a bellwether like Redditch, in Worcestershire, and across the West Midlands, to Basildon and Peterborough. Labour can comfort itself with gaining Plymouth, and the fact that in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster it won more seats than at any time since 1986. But both parties would surely be wrong to read too much into any of these results, given that we’ve all seen how a completely different picture can emerge a matter of weeks later.Now, it’s true that you’d expect an opposition party to be trouncing a government in power for eight years and rocked by serial resignations, a visible inability to handle Brexit, and the shaming scandal of Windrush. But we know that Corbyn didn’t have the broadcast attention that clearly helped him last year, and that plenty of voters are simply not that engaged by local ballots. People may want to declare we’ve reached “peak Corbyn”, but it’s a stretch to do that on the basis of these results.Instead, you can make small, discrete observations about specific local situations. I’ll offer just one, related to the row over antisemitism in Labour. Plenty of those who’d always insisted the whole thing was invented, and a smear, also said that the mainstream Jewish organisations did not speak for the Jewish community when they sounded the alarm, that they were guilty of exaggerating the fears they claimed to represent, and that many Jews were, in fact, quite happy with Corbyn-led Labour. Well, now we have some pretty compelling data suggesting otherwise. In Barnet, but also in parts of Salford, Bury, Gateshead and Leeds, Jewish voters, including many who’d long backed Labour, told canvassers they could not vote for the party. And they didn’t.Labour’s base is more split, thriving with the younger, the more educated and the urban, many of whom are passionately anti-Brexit, while trying to hold on to older voters in post-industrial towns who backed leave with enthusiasm. There was more evidence of that fault line on Thursday, as Labour advanced in pro-remain Trafford but fell back in pro-leave Nuneaton and Derby.Until now, Labour has sought to ride these two horses at once, with the policy of “strategic ambiguity”. Last June it seemed to work, as Labour held on to its leave-voting seats even as it picked up remain strongholds like Canterbury and Kensington. But strategic ambiguity could be about to run out of road.The calculation here is not chiefly electoral, and certainly not based on these latest results. Rather it is based on both principle and practicality. Put simply, Labour will soon need to come off the Brexit fence – both because it should do and because it will have to.The practical urgency is that a series of Commons votes are looming in which Labour will have to take a clear stand. Even ahead of the crunch decisions in October, the Lords will vote on Tuesday on an amendment that would keep Britain in the single market. If that passes and comes before the Commons, would the Labour front bench move against it? If they did, what would their anti-Brexit supporters make of that: Labour acting to keep Britain out of the single market, with its protections of environmental and workers’ rights? The one option that won’t be available to the party leadership is more fudge.The principled case is more obvious. Labour is a pro-European party and understands that leaving both the single market and customs union would be a disaster for this country. It can argue that leaving the EU while staying in those institutions, in a kind of Norway-plus arrangement – with acceptance of free movement in principle, while working to modify its effects in practice, as other EU members do – would be a fair reflection of the 52-48 verdict of 2016. Out, but a little bit in.But wouldn’t that be electoral madness? What about all those leave areas represented by Labour MPs? As it happens, polls show that even among those Labour voters who backed leave, a plurality want Corbyn to commit to permanent membership of the customs union and single market. After all, breaking from those bodies was not on the ballot paper.Ambiguity served Labour well for a while. But it has outlived its usefulness and could soon become actively harmful, a worst-of-both-worlds position that pleases neither leavers nor remainers. Those who want Brexit will vote for the real thing, which means voting Tory those who oppose it will start looking around for a party that will do the same.

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040.”The motor industry responded angrily to the news, saying it was disappointed to see policy being communicated by leaks.Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports.“We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance.”When the 2040 ban was announced last summer, shortly after a similar plan by France, the UK government declined to be drawn on whether it covered hybrids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/996adf00ada88848473d7b07c548fcbc9e5b2622/0_0_4500_2995/master/4500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5bdd6cc90aa2afac516d64058e123acd 1760w","title":"afc wimbledon mk dons league one different directions","story":"AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons will always live in each other’s shadow, destined forever – or at least for a long while – to be mentioned in the same breath. Both clubs were born of the decision to allow the original Wimbledon FC to be uprooted and moved to Milton Keynes in 2002, since when one has struggled to maintain its status and the other fought to catch them.Two years ago they stood for the first time on the same rung of the footballing ladder, as MK Dons tumbled out of the Championship while Wimbledon came through the League Two play-offs to secure their sixth promotion. Over the last seven days they have been separated once again: last weekend MK Dons lost 2-0 to Scunthorpe and were relegated on Tuesday Wimbledon drew at Doncaster to guarantee survival.“It’s something that’s built up a lot,” says George Williams, the MK Dons full-back and reigning player of the season (he will reign for another year, as this campaign has been so disappointing the prize has not been handed out). “As a player you’ve just got to get on with your job. We’re disappointed to be relegated and it doesn’t matter to us who finished above us. For us it’s not focused on any particular team – we’re disappointed we finished below everyone. We wanted to finish top of the pile.”Erik Samuelson, Wimbledon’s chief executive, sighs when the question is put to him. “We don’t make that comparison,” he says. “It’s the media and, to be fair, fans. My consistent message is we will not have our achievements measured by comparison with anyone else.”Before the season’s final fixture the clubs are separated by four places and 10 points but their campaigns could hardly have been more contrasting. Wimbledon were among the favourites for relegation, constrained by one of the ision’s more humble budgets, while the well-funded MK Dons were expected to challenge for promotion Wimbledon have had the same manager since October 2012, while MK Dons are on their third since the turn of the year.“Robbie Neilson had a really good end to last season and that’s why we all had really high hopes for this year and why we were one of the favourites to go up,” says Williams. “It just never got going like it did last season. There were a lot of changes and for one reason or another it didn’t work out.”Though the club started reasonably, and were mid-table in October, Neilson was sacked in January when they first hit the bottom four. “Dan Micciche came in, which was a bit of a surprise for some people because he didn’t have a lot of experience,” Williams continues. “He did really well with what he had and we started playing really good football and had a stint in March where it looked like we were getting out of trouble. We didn’t get the results but in terms of style of play we’d come on leaps and bounds.”Micciche was sacked last month, having won three of his 16 games in charge. “I want to apologise to our supporters and the city of Milton Keynes,” said the club’s chairman, Pete Winkelman, who admitted to “two bad managerial decisions”. Keith Millen, Micciche’s assistant, has guided them through the remainder of the season and started to plan summer recruitment but remains a caretaker Exeter’s Paul Tisdale is current favourite to take permanent charge. “We will have one of the biggest budgets next season and we need to get a manager that we all start believing in again,” Winkelman said.The curtain comes down on the Dons’ season at Shrewsbury, who with a comparatively minuscule budget have won more than twice as many points and are preparing for the play-offs.“I think the club, everyone from the players and staff to the fans, are at a real low point right now, one of the lowest points the club’s ever been at,” says Williams. “But you’ve got to face it head on and build an optimism around the place. It’s an opportunity to create something again. There’ll be a lot of optimism for next season. It’s a chance to build success here.”Meanwhile at Wimbledon the board and Neal Ardley, the manager, met on Wednesday to discuss their summer plans. “Because of the stability here players recognise they’re not signing for a manager who next week might be gone,” says Samuelson. “When they stop to think about it, that’s important. Players want stability – they also want good money but they want stability – and that is something we can offer.”Their campaign ends at Kingsmeadow with a game against already relegated Bury and they hope to have only one further full season in their current ground before moving back to their original home borough of Merton. Having received planning permission for a new stadium in December, they expect it to be ready midway through 2019-20.“I regularly say: ‘A football club without ambition, what’s it doing?’ says Samuelson. “When we set up we said our target was to stay in fan ownership, to get into the Football League and to go back home to Merton. We’ve done two of them and we’re on the verge of doing the third. So you start to think, what’s your next target? It was League One and we made it. The next target is the Championship. Let’s get there and see what happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b4f19553b5f29fae7e0528f804142b80a5fa899/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192319277d810aabd512bd3ec2821aa0","title":"real madrid regal curse dynasty bernabeu","story":"The defining image of this Real team isn’t a priestly boot room or the intellectualism of total football. The defining image of this team is Cristiano Ronaldo’s absOh. He’s here again. The man with the rapacious desire for annihilating success in his eyes. In the end it was a strange kind of glory for Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday evening as Real Madrid progressed precariously but also, somehow, inevitably to another Champions League final.There has been a lot of talk about Ronaldo’s stripped-down role in his late prime. But this was a performance of such minimalism it might have been etched on a grain of rice, a vision of the ultimate endgame some years from now whereby Ronaldo is wheeled on to the pitch by a litter of footmen, emerging from his bathing machine to patrol a roped-off zone around the penalty spot, sampling the air, occasionally dropping into a series of “muscle poses” while in the background a football match takes place.This is, of course, a tribute not a criticism. Even within these narrowed lines Ronaldo runs and shoot and leaps more than anyone else, just as even on an off-night you still felt Madrid couldn’t have won without him, a player who walks ahead of this team like an imperial standard.And so here we are. Real Madrid are one win away from four Champions Leagues in five years, a run of success that would make the late Ronaldo years the most dominant club-football era of the modern age.There are a few things worth saying about this. The first is that while Madrid’s success is thrilling it is also essentially meaningless. This is a success that defies patterns and systems, escapes beyond any kind of workable formula others could adopt.What is the moral of this story? What is the philosophy of this Madrid team? How should anyone else attempt to repeat it? Sign Ronaldo? Play in white shirts at the Bernabéu and imitate that conquering imperial-meringue demeanour?At times it feels like a kind of pop-art triumphalism, no more than a perfect surface. The defining image of this team isn’t a priestly boot room or the earnest intellectualism of total football. The defining image of this team is Ronaldo’s abs.In the middle of all this winning, Madrid have outlasted the teams around them who were supposed to define the age. Barcelona meant something: the club of nurture and Cruyff-ian collectivism. The Bayern Munich of 2013 meant something, fruits of that vast German production project, a social experiment that could be studied and admiringly replicated.And yet it is Madrid whose name blocks out the top line in the history books, a Madrid that even escapes the galactico mould of bought success, the spine made up of a £10m goalkeeper, some shrewd defensive gambles and a pair of sublime central midfielders signed on the cheap.Again, this is not an attempt to criticise, but a comment on the basic idea of meaning in sport, that craving we have for narrative. A couple of weeks ago I found myself engaged in a heated outburst on this subject during a  Football Weekly podcast with my much-cherished colleague Barry Glendenning.Barry was talking about Tottenham’s losing run in semi-finals. In the course of which I found myself disturbed by the suggestion this is some kind of hex, a shared fear, something passed down through the generations like – I suggested – a witch’s curse.People who listened to the podcast were upset by this heated discussion. It rumbled on over social media. The following day some passers-by spotted Barry in a pub and chanted “witch’s curse” at him, behaviour I cannot possibly condone unless people really want to do it, and which is not funny or proof that I was right.I see now what had unsettled me was the suggestion of a lack of order, the idea this can be explained away because some teams win and some lose. I wanted science. Instead I got people tweeting “witch’s curse” at me the whole time and always out of context. Witch’s curse has become my Lineker’s shat-on.Even worse, this week has been spent writing about precisely this subject, the fact some teams do just seem to win. That the inverse of the witch’s curse, a shared regal magic, seems to hang over the greatest club dynasty in football. All of which is obviously not funny or even the slightest proof that Barry is right.At which point we just keep coming back to Ronaldo and the idea of the compelling personality. Madrid win because of graft and talent. But to win to this degree suggests something more, a strange kind of chemistry between Madrid’s victory-as-destiny aura and Ronaldo’s own overwhelming will to power.In game mode he can even seem a little inhuman, a being created from nylon and liquid metal. Ronaldo’s breath smells of presidential motorcade. His hair is made of gold-leaf weave. When he sweats he sweats a blend of antique cologne, chinchilla tears and human hope. It is an extraordinary human construct, a galvanising force of image and will that has driven his team on to a kind of ultimacy.Some will recoil at the idea of Total Ego-Ball, the perceived selfishness of a player whose only real goal is to make his team win. But it is also oddly reassuring that the idea of the winning personality should remain intact though football’s rising tides of finance and nation-state ambition, a triumph of meaningless, exhilarating human will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93f43e8beb852b5f3873447cc68df4123fc59b01/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43d39853a8d25674e214dc61dff88718","title":"brighton v manchester united premier league live","story":"Davy Propper goes straight back into the Brighton line-up after serving a three-match ban for the straight red card he was shown for a foul on Huddersfield Town’s Jonathan Hogg.

By Colin CrummyClaire Ratinon, 34, was working in TV production in New York when she stumbled across Brooklyn Grange, an acre of rooftop farm seven storeys up in Queens. “I looked across at the Manhattan skyline while standing among kale, peppers and tomatoes, growing in the middle of the sky, and fell in love,” she says. Ratinon, from Surrey, started volunteering, picking tomatoes and getting sunburnt. It sowed the seed of something: “It was the calmest, cleanest place in the city and somewhere my soul was saying, this is where you need to spend more time.”Brooklyn Grange appeared at the right time in Ratinon’s life. After three years living in the US, she had begun to question what she was eating. The urban farm, where everything is grown organically, showed Ratinon a different way of food production. She took time off work and spent several months there with other apprentices, learning how to grow crops organically, before moving back to London in late 2014. There, she sought out growing communities and trained as a patchwork farmer at the Hackney-based social enterprise Growing Communities – growing salads at one of nine small market gardens – and as a beekeeper and gardener at the Bee Friendly Trust charity. She was also the lead gardener on Farmopolis, an ambitious arts space with a garden created from thousands of donated plants from the 2016 Chelsea flower show.There is huge potential in urban food growing, she says, and she is determined to be at the forefront. “Urban soil is some of the richest we have because it isn’t subjected to the pesticide and fertiliser that industrialised systems mete out on the countryside.”With organic growing, she says, “you are producing food without taking anything else away. Your whole practice is about working with nature and enriching the environment at the same time as feeding people. I feel very passionate about that.” In the meantime, she is spending the summer on an organic farm in Wiltshire, harvesting asparagus. Ratinon is also drawn to the therapeutic potential in urban farming. “When I walk into an urban growing space there’s a sense of relief,” she says. “They feel like some of the safest, most beautiful spaces I’ve been into.”Favourite plant Tomatoes. They taste approximately one thousand times better than any you’d get in the supermarket. Tumbling Toms can be grown really easily.Hates Slug pellets. I get why people use them for their ornamentals, but not accepting you have to share your garden with the natural world really bugs me out.Next big thing For growing to become part of mental health care as an alternative therapy.Alexander Hoyle, 25, is a horticultural hit on social media with 25k followers on Instagram. They are drawn to his daily updates from his day job as plantsman at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London. His posts of roses, bluebells and the occasional peacock celebrate the traditional English garden in an intoxicating blend of blooms and borders.Real life is not quite as rosy. “It’s an absolute nightmare for dating,” Hoyle says of his dedication to the role, “because you have to find someone who is like-minded. They have to love plants, and that can be tricky. Even though they think it’s romantic and wonderful, there’s the reality of having to look after the plants – and sometimes the plants come first.”Hoyle’s love affair with the English garden dates back to a childhood spent in the Cotswolds. His late mother was a gardener, the family patch part of the National Garden Scheme. “It’s just there,” he says of the desire to dig. “You suddenly want to be outside, you have a sense of pride and ownership.” So he worked at a local nursery during school holidays and visited Chelsea with his grandparents. (“I was in awe,” he says.) He went to plant fairs, collected pelargoniums, and at 16, began studies in horticulture at Pershore College, Worcestershire.It was Hoyle’s first gardening job, age 11 at a local 17th-century manor house, that settled the matter. “That got me going at first it was mowing grass, clearing up fallen fruit and squashing lily beetles,” Hoyle says. “The vicar used to pay me 20p a beetle. I had small hands that caught them quickly.”After completing his first horticultural course, Hoyle spent two years working at Aberglasney Gardens in Carmarthenshire, west Wales. The head gardener was Kew-trained and encouraged Hoyle to take up further study. He studied the Kew Diploma for three years before securing a permanent position there, helping to manage the Rose Garden, the Great Broad Walk Borders, Palm House pond and Victoria Gate entrance. These are some of Kew’s choicest spots, which Hoyle shows off to his online following.Hoyle’s passion has taken him around the world. A tour of rose gardens in America included the White House, accessed through American gardening friends. He is preparing for a similar rose-centred tour of Australia and there is a book in the works.He’s clearly set for big things, but for now, he says, the plan is to stay at Kew. “I consider myself a plantsman, finding solutions and working with designers,” he says. Just don’t describe any of this as a day job. “When I meet new people, they say, your job’s great. And I’m like, no, no that’s my life.”Favourite plant Roses. They’re an essential part of the English garden.Hates Bad pruning. When people hack trees or leave a plant that’s really suffering. A good cut is really important.Next big thing Big borders mixed borders where you plant trees, shrubs, bulbs, all together in one space.Huw Richards’ most popular Facebook post is a 60-second tutorial on how to grow vegetables, which has been viewed 6.6m times. “I was sharing a method of growing beans where you grow them in a rain gutter and slide them out into a raised bed,” says the 19-year-old. “People seemed to love that and it just completely blew up.”His YouTube channel, Huw’s Nursery, shows how to grow organic produce at home for a fraction of the supermarket cost, with tips on picking hard-to-reach fruit (130k views), cheap soil nutrients (388k views), and growing potatoes the lazy way (1m views). The site has 82k subscribers.Richards built his social media profile while boarding on scholarship at Llandovery College. A head boy there, he gardened, filmed and edited in his spare time (he’s produced more than 400 videos). He was awarded a £5,000 grant to promote sustainable food, won a national young entrepreneur award and made £12,000 by his 18th birthday. He listens to the podcasts of entrepreneurial self-help guru Gary Vaynerchuk while in the garden. “Gary’s been the biggest influence in my life,” he says. “He’s very strategic and tries to push positivity. His mindset has really helped me develop.”Despite getting three Bs in his A-levels, Richards did not apply to university but dedicates most of his time to Huw’s Nursery while working part-time teaching gardening at his former school. The long-term plan is the big time. “I’d love to be a gardening presenter because I think I’d appeal to a younger demographic,” Richards says. “The average age of gardening presenters and writers is a lot older than I am. I’ve been doing this all by myself. I’ve had 20m views online.”Richards has met a number of production companies, a management agency and a publisher this year. But some opportunities he is minded to decline. “On my Facebook page, some older ladies wanted me to do a topless gardener calendar,” he laughs. “But I don’t think so.”Favourite plant Rainbow chard. It’s colourful, and although it has a short shelf life, it’s a really productive green – the stems are delicious with a bit of butter.Hates The low ersity of varieties in supermarkets. It makes people less excited about vegetables.Next big thing Swede, because it makes a great alternative to mashed potatoes. It goes really well with stronger-flavoured foods and grows well in our climate.The powerful partnership of Tamara Bridge and Kate Savill, both 30, is rare in usually male-centric gardening circles. Both run inidual, award-winning garden design practices, but also collaborate on show gardens. In 2017, they pooled their talents for a BBC Radio 2 Feel Good Garden at Chelsea this year they are back to create an artisan garden for a craft gin company. “Architects work together in big practices so why should it be different with garden designers?” says Bristol-based Savill.The pair met in competition at RHS Tatton Park flower show in 2015 where they were both up for Young Designer of the Year. Bridge won, and Savill was awarded a gold medal – not bad for her first show garden. The two hit it off when they spent three weeks living side by side in a camper van (Bridge) and a tent (Savill) at the show. “It started off just Tamara and me in a field, two girls cracking on for weeks,” says Savill.Collaborating has been a great creative experience, says Bridge, whose practice is based in Norfolk. “Partnerships can be seen as quite a sparky relationship, but we are the opposite, we get calmer.” They consult each other on their inidual projects and say working together only adds to the sum of the work, even if Savill tends to have the final tweak.“Kate waits till I’ve gone off site,” Bridge laughs. “I get quite stressed about changing things on site so she’ll wait until I’ve gone and sneak in.” In her defence, Savill always makes her partner aware of the alterations.For their Chelsea show, Bridge and Savill are heading a team of 22, which splits squarely on gender lines: the construction side is exclusively male, the planters mostly women. The construction team gets paid first and the planters only if budget allows. The women, therefore, tend to be volunteers. It’s accepted practice generally, say Bridge and Savill, but it’s beginning to get their goat. “Why is it acceptable for a project to run like that?” says Bridge. “The next time we do this it’s at the top of our list of things that won’t happen. It does make me quite cross.”Favourite plant Bridge: I love a wild strawberry. Chives are great because the flower is edible and you can pull it off and sprinkle it on your salad for a spring onion taste.Hates Bridge: bad lawn edges. I like a nice crisp edge with no tufty bits. If you have a flowerbed with an edge on the lawn, it needs to be neat and tidy.Next big thing Savill: crazy paving is making a big wave at the moment.Lachlan Rae is living the good life on a grand scale. The 25-year-old gardener lives in a cottage on the private Auchendolly estate, near Aberdeen in Scotland, with his wife and three young children, all under the age of six. “It’s a lovely big garden for me to take ownership of,” says Rae, who is originally from Dumfries. “You walk out of the door and you’re at your work. It’s a nice way to live.’Working alone or with his wife, Sian, Rae insists on traditional horticultural practices where possible. “I like to think of myself as an arts and crafts gardener. There’s no automated watering, it’s all watering cans. Instead of using plastic canes everywhere, I cut hazel twigs up in the woods and use that for staking plants to keep the environmental footprint down.”Rae left school at 16 and took seasonal work as a Christmas tree cutter and then a self-employed gardener, where his lack of expertise exasperated him. “People were asking me questions I couldn’t answer.” After taking a local gardening course he enrolled on the horticulture with plantsmanship course at the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh. The academic grounding helped Rae win last year’s Young Horticulturalist of the Year, a national competition run by the Institute of Horticulture which tests the scholarly mettle of gardeners under 30 across categories that include horticultural science and practice plus plant, pest and weed identification.These wider aspects of gardening often go overlooked, says Rae. “There’s a lot more to horticulture than just gardening there’s a lot of science and it’s artistic,” he says. ‘I don’t know that the message is out there about the range of jobs. Gardening is just seen as pushing a wheelbarrow about all day. Schools are at fault it’s seen as a career for the no-hopers.”Rae moves to a new role this month as head gardener on Wiston Estate, in West Sussex. He will be in charge of a four-person team, all under 25, that will maintain 17 acres of public gardens. “It’s just what I need, a new challenge.”Favourite plant Cercidiphyllum japonicum, also known as the katsura tree.

Stepping into one should feel like a holiday from life. “When I design someone’s garden, it’s important to look at what inspires them and what kind of environment they feel happiest in,” says the 25-year-old RHS Young Designer of the Year 2017. “People draw from their experiences of being on holiday or from their childhood, time spent in nature. A lot of my work is an interpretation of that happy place in the garden.”Bujauskaite’s award-winning garden, Studio Unwired – shown at last year’s RHS Tatton Park flower show – drew inspiration from her own happy place, the Baltic coastline of her childhood. She created an outdoor working space informed by the earthy, serene summers of the Lithuanian seaside.Bujauskaite knew from childhood that she wanted to pursue design. She attended the Fine Arts School in Lithuania from age 12 until her family moved to Northampton in 2008, and she took a 3D design course in Milton Keynes followed by one in Landscape Architecture at Birmingham City University. There she was awarded the Landscape Institute’s John Knight award twice, for degree and master’s projects.The personal connections in Bujauskaite’s work first surfaced here her master’s explored the benefits of garden spaces for patients in palliative care. “I was 17 when my mum passed away from cancer. I had to spend a lot of time in a hospice with her and I wished there was a garden to walk out into and just spend some time in,” she says. The therapeutic aspects of colour, texture and how a garden view can offer relief to patients are elements Bujauskaite would like to touch on again in future work. “A garden can change people’s experience of going through something sad or horrible,” she says.Favourite plant Grasses: at sales, people pick the bright colours and all the grasses are left behind, which I love most.Grow now If you live in a flat, grow herbs like rosemary or mint or anything flowering that would enliven the space.Next big thing Wabi-sabi, from Japanese culture, is seeing beauty in imperfection. The cracks in timber or paving can be beautiful, too, because they show the ageing or time passing by. Will Williams, 22, had a rude awakening to gardening. At 16, having left school, he got a job with a local landscape gardener in Sussex. The 5.30am start and 12-hour working days were a steep learning curve. “It matured me very quickly,” he says. “I remember a lorry dumped four tonnes of sand at the front of a terraced house. I was passed a spade and a bucket and told to get all the sand round the back. That was a long day.”He has advanced remarkably quickly since. His passion for gardening deepening, he took a local course near his family home in Sussex. At 18, having saved half the fees, with the remainder paid by his parents, Williams became the youngest diploma student at London College of Garden Design. He went it alone after graduating, specialising in residential garden design, freelancing for his “bread and butter”, then winning projects against industry veterans. “I had nothing to risk, and in five years’ time I probably would have, so it was the perfect time to show the industry what I’ve got at quite an early age by myself,” Williams says.Williams’ next show sees him up for the RHS Young Designer of the Year 2018 (the winners are announced in July). At One is a show garden about balance, pleasing to humans and attractive to bees, butterflies and bugs. His ultimate ambition is a main avenue garden at Chelsea flower show. And while he is still young (a landscaper once refused to work with him because he looked so fresh-faced), Williams believes starting so early has been to his advantage. “Lots of people are career changers so they might not have as much experience as I do,” he says. “This is all I have really known from the age of 16. My youth hasn’t stopped me yet.”Favourite plant The amelanchier tree.

After all, there is a significant minority who are quite badly affected by sulphites, yet there’s not nearly as much discussion about that as there is about, say, gluten intolerance.Sulphites feature in most wines whites more than reds, and sweet wines significantly more than both. They prevent oxidation (that is, they stop the juice turning brown), they keep wines stable (important when they have to travel) and they preserve their bright, fresh fruit flavours. The downside is that higher levels can, in some people, provoke headaches and breathing difficulties, though headache can of course also be triggered by the amount you drink.Even if a wine has no added sulphur (often referred to on the label as NAS), it may well contain some naturally occurring or “free sulphur” as a result of the fermentation process. It’s really the total level you need to be concerned about, which, under EU regulations, can be up to 400mg per litre in the case of sweet wines (200mg per litre is the maximum for whites and 150mg for reds). Natural wine bars will generally stock wines that are a good deal lower than that – in the case of Plateau in Brighton, for example, they aim for 30mg per litre.The bad news for those who are looking for NAS wines is that they are not that widely available, they’re generally quite expensive and, if you’re used to the bright fruit flavours of conventionally made wines, you may even not like them (that said, like low-sulphur wines, they generally benefit from decanting).There is, however, a device called Üllo that is designed to remove sulphites from standard wines (currently £69.99, plus extra for the filters). The makers aren’t specific about how, exactly, that works, but the good news is that, from a taste point of view, it has no impact and, if anything, clarifies and brightens wines poured through it. It made a slightly rough-and-ready Romanian syrah, for instance, taste quite a bit better, but that may have simply been the effect of aerating it. In the small print at the bottom of the home page, however, it says, “Üllo is not intended to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent reactions to sulphites”, which makes you wonder what the point of the device is. The website also advises those who suffer from an allergy or sensitivity to sulphites to consult a doctor before using the Üllo. All I’m saying is that it exists, so it’s an option.

Restaurants that make their own sourdough increasingly pepper their menus with the leftovers. And why not? I love coming across a crunchy golden breadcrumb in a salad, on a pudding, or as a crust, like here. Today’s anchovy-decked fish fillet is given a delicate layer of crunch with a scattering of crisp crumbs. Never throw out that stale loaf.Hasselbacks (baked sliced potatoes) are such a treat, but if you’re short of time, omit the slicing and roast the potatoes whole to cut down your prep time by 10 minutes.80g anchovies, drained1 heaped tsp capers1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2 egg yolks100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling4 fillets sea bream or other white fish1 small handful parsley 8 tbsp dry breadcrumbs1 tsp pul biber (Turkish chilli flakes)For the potatoes24 small jersey royals (about 1kg) 40g butterSalt and black pepper A few sprigs thyme, leaves picked40g olive oilPrep the potatoes first. Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Put a potato on to a tablespoon or wooden spoon and, using a small, sharp knife, make incisions at 2-3mm intervals along the potato without cutting all the way through – the spoon helps stop your knife cutting all the way down. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes.Melt the butter in a small pan. Put the potatoes in a baking tin, season with salt and pepper, and toss in the butter, thyme and oil. Roast for 35-45 minutes, (the time will depend on the size of the potatoes), basting the potatoes in the fat a few times during cooking.Meanwhile put the anchovies, capers, garlic, egg yolks and oil in a medium-sized bowl and blitz to a smooth emulsion with a handheld blender. Taste and check for seasoning – the anchovies will provide the salt, but a few generous grinds of black pepper will make all the difference. Line a baking tray with greased baking paper or foil, and put the fish fillets on top.Wash the parsley, pick the leaves (discarding the stems) and finely chop. Toss into the breadcrumbs and chilli flakes. Spread a heaped teaspoon of the anchovy emulsion over the skin of each fillet, followed by a generous layer of parsley breadcrumbs. When the potatoes are almost ready, drizzle the fillets with a little oil (about two teaspoons), then roast alongside the potatoes as the potatoes for 10-12 minutes (or longer, if you have a thicker fillet of cod or hake), until the breadcrumbs are golden and toasted and the fish gently flakes. Serve the fish and the golden potatoes with a crisp, green salad and a wedge of lemon.Thankfully, you will have some anchovy mayonnaise left, and it is wonderful on a chargrilled steak or lamb chop and great with crudités (think fennel wedges, red pepper and chicory). Try stirring a few tablespoons into a bechamel, too – you may never look at cauliflower cheese in the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2452c3b3ecdedfee0ad90c27acb0ee280103e1d/0_116_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c216ce3a8f0ee240818351377ed7313","title":"i had to guard an empty room the rise of the pointless job","story":"Copying and pasting emails. Inventing meaningless tasks for others. Just looking busy. Why do so many people feel their work is completely unnecessary?One day, the wall shelves in my office collapsed. This left books scattered all over the floor and a jagged, half-dislocated metal frame that once held the shelves in place dangling over my desk. I’m a professor of anthropology at a university. A carpenter appeared an hour later to inspect the damage, and announced gravely that, as there were books all over the floor, safety rules prevented him from entering the room or taking further action. I would have to stack the books and not touch anything else, whereupon he would return at the earliest available opportunity.The carpenter never reappeared. Each day, someone in the anthropology department would call, often multiple times, to ask about the fate of the carpenter, who always turned out to have something extremely pressing to do. By the time a week was out, it had become apparent that there was one man employed by buildings and grounds whose entire job it was to apologise for the fact that the carpenter hadn’t come. He seemed a nice man. Still, it’s hard to imagine he was particularly happy with his work life.Everyone is familiar with the sort of jobs that don’t seem, to the outsider, really to do much of anything: HR consultants, communications coordinators, PR researchers, financial strategists, corporate lawyers or the sort of people who spend their time staffing committees that discuss the problem of unnecessary committees. What if these jobs really are useless, and those who hold them are actually aware of it? Could there be anything more demoralising than having to wake up in the morning five out of seven days of one’s adult life to perform a task that one believes does not need to be performed, is simply a waste of time or resources, or even makes the world worse? There are plenty of surveys about whether people are happy at work, but what about whether people feel their jobs have any good reason to exist? I decided to investigate this phenomenon by drawing on more than 250 testimonies from people around the world who felt they once had, or now have, what I call a bullshit job.The defining feature is this: one so completely pointless that even the person who has to perform it every day cannot convince themselves there’s a good reason for them to be doing it. They may not be able to admit this to their co-workers – often, there are very good reasons not to do so – but they are convinced the job is pointless nonetheless.Bullshit jobs are not just jobs that are useless typically, there has to be some degree of pretence and fraud involved as well. The employee must feel obliged to pretend that there is, in fact, a good reason their job exists, even if, privately, they find such claims ridiculous.When people speak of bullshit jobs, they are generally referring to employment that involves being paid to work for someone else, either on a waged or salaried basis (most would include paid consultancies). Obviously, there are many self-employed people who manage to get money from others by means of falsely pretending to provide them with some benefit or service (normally we call them grifters, scam artists, charlatans or frauds), just as there are self-employed people who get money off others by doing or threatening to do them harm (normally we refer to them as muggers, burglars, extortionists or thieves). In the first case, at least, we can definitely speak of bullshit, but not of bullshit jobs, because these aren’t “jobs”, properly speaking. A con job is an act, not a profession. People do sometimes speak of professional burglars, but this is just a way of saying that theft is the burglar’s primary source of income.These considerations allow us to formulate what I think can serve as a final working definition of a bullshit job: a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence, even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.They are given some minor task to justify their existence, but this is really just a pretext: in reality, flunky jobs are those that exist only or primarily to make someone else look or feel important. A classic flunky is someone like Steve, who told me, “I just graduated, and my new ‘job’ basically consists of my boss forwarding emails to me with the message: ‘Steve refer to the below’, and I reply that the email is inconsequential or spam.”Doormen are the most obvious example. They perform the same function in the houses of the very rich that electronic intercoms have performed for everyone else since at least the 1950s. In some countries, such as Brazil, some buildings still have uniformed elevator operators whose entire job is to push the button for you. Further examples are receptionists and front-desk personnel at places that obviously don’t need them. Other flunkies provide a badge of importance. These include cold callers, who make contact with potential clients on the understanding that the broker for whom they work is so busy making money that they need an assistant to make this call.These are people whose jobs have an aggressive element but, crucially, who exist only because other people also employ people in these roles. The most obvious example of this are national armed forces. Countries need armies only because other countries have armies if no one had an army, armies would not be needed. But the same can be said of most lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers and corporate lawyers.Goons find their jobs objectionable not just because they feel they lack positive value, but also because they see them as essentially manipulative and aggressive. These include a lot of call-centre employees: “You’re making an active negative contribution to people’s day,” explained one anonymous testimony. “I called people up to hock them useless shit: specifically, access to their ‘credit score’ that they could obtain for free elsewhere, but that we were offering, with some mindless add-ons, for £6.99 a month.”These employees’ jobs exist only because of a glitch or fault in the organisation they are there to solve a problem that ought not to exist. The most obvious examples of duct-tapers are those whose job it is to undo the damage done by sloppy or incompetent superiors.Many duct-taper jobs are the result of a glitch in the system that no one has bothered to correct – tasks that could easily be automated, for instance, but haven’t been either because no one has got around to it, or because the manager wants to maintain as many subordinates as possible, or because of some structural confusion.Magda’s job required her to proofread research reports written by her company’s star researcher-statistician. “The man didn’t know the first thing about statistics, and he struggled to produce grammatically correct sentences. I’d reward myself with a cake if I found a coherent paragraph. I lost 12lb working in that company. My job was to convince him to undertake a major reworking of every report he produced. Of course, he would never agree to correct anything, so I would then have to take the report to the company directors. They were statistically illiterate, too, but, being the directors, they could drag things out even more.”These employees exist only or primarily to allow an organisation to be able to claim it is doing something that, in fact, it is not doing. The most miserable thing about box-ticking jobs is that the employee is usually aware that not only does the box-ticking exercise do nothing towards accomplishing its ostensible purpose, but also it undermines it, because it erts time and resources away from the purpose itself.We’re all familiar with box-ticking as a form of government. If a government’s employees are caught doing something very bad – taking bribes, for instance, or shooting citizens at traffic lights – the first reaction is invariably to create a “fact-finding commission” to get to the bottom of things. This serves two functions. First of all, it’s a way of insisting that, aside from a small group of miscreants, no one had any idea that any of this was happening (this, of course, is rarely true) second, it’s a way of implying that once all the facts are in, someone will definitely do something about it (this usually isn’t true, either).Local government has been described as little more than an endless sequence of box-ticking rituals revolving around monthly “target figures”. There are all sorts of ways that private companies employ people to be able to tell themselves they are doing something that they aren’t really doing. Many large corporations, for instance, maintain their own in-house magazines or even television channels, the ostensible purpose of which is to keep employees up to date on interesting news and developments, but which, in fact, exist for almost no reason other than to allow executives to experience that warm and pleasant feeling that comes when you see a favourable story about yourself in the media.These fall into two groups. Type one comprises those whose role consists entirely of assigning work to others. This job can be considered bullshit if the taskmaster believes there is no need for their intervention, and that if they were not there, underlings would be perfectly capable of carrying on by themselves.Whereas the first variety of taskmaster is merely useless, the second variety does actual harm. These are taskmasters whose primary role is to create bullshit tasks for others to do, to supervise bullshit, or even to create entirely new bullshit jobs.“Strategic mission statements” (or, even worse, “strategic vision documents”) instil a particular terror in academics. These are the primary means by which corporate management techniques – setting up quantifiable methods for assessing performance, forcing teachers and scholars to spend more and more of their time assessing and justifying what they do, and less and less time actually doing it – are insinuated into academic life.I should add that there is really only one class of people who not only deny their jobs are pointless, but also express outright hostility to the very idea that our economy is rife with bullshit jobs. These are – predictably enough – business owners and others in charge of hiring and firing. No one, they insist, would ever spend company money on an employee who wasn’t needed. All the people who are convinced their jobs are worthless must be deluded, or self-important, or simply don’t understand their real function, which is fully visible only to those above. One might be tempted to conclude from this response that this is one class of people who genuinely don’t realise their own jobs are bullshit.These holders of bullshit jobs testify to the misery that can ensue when the only challenge you can overcome in your work is the challenge of coming to terms with the fact that you are not, in fact, presented with any challenges when the only way you can exercise your powers is in coming up with creative ways to cover up the fact that you cannot exercise your powers of managing the fact that you have, completely against your choosing, been turned into a parasite and a fraud. All wanted to remain anonymous:“I worked as a museum guard for a global security company in a museum where one exhibition room was left unused. My job was to guard that empty room, ensuring no museum guests touched the, well, nothing in the room and ensure nobody set any fires. To keep my mind sharp and attention unided, I was forbidden any form of mental stimulation, like books, phones, etc. As nobody was ever there, I sat still and twiddled my thumbs for seven and a half hours, waiting for the fire alarm to sound. If it did, I was to calmly stand up and walk out. That was it.”Copying and pasting“I was given one responsibility: watching an inbox that received emails in a certain form from employees asking for tech help, and copy and paste it into a different form. Not only was this a textbook example of an automatable job, it actually used to be automated. There was some disagreement between managers that led to a standardisation that nullified the automation.”Sitting in the right place“I work in a college dormitory during the summer. I have worked at this job for three years, and at this point it is still unclear to me what my actual duties are. Primarily, it seems that my job consists of physically occupying space at the front desk. While engaged in this, I am free to ‘pursue my own projects’, which I take to mean mainly creating rubber band balls out of rubber bands I find in the cabinets. When I am not busy with this, I might be checking the office email account (I have basically no training or administrative power, of course, so all I can do is forward these emails to my boss), moving packages from the door, where they get dropped off, to the package room, answering phone calls (again, I know nothing and rarely answer a question to the caller’s satisfaction), or finding ketchup packets from 2005 in the desk drawers. For these duties, I am paid $14 an hour.”• This is an edited extract from Bullshit Jobs: A Theory by David Graeber, published on 14 May by Allen Lane at £20.

The Conservatives lost seats but were relieved to cling on to key councils. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had a “reasonable night, a good night”. Jeremy Corbyn celebrated seizing Plymouth council and said he was delighted by the result. One pollster estimated that a general election matching these results would see Labour with a similar number of seats to the 262 it scored in 2017, while the Tories would lose 12.Surprise success for two Green candidates against Conservative incumbents helped Labour become the biggest party in the Manchester council, one of its biggest successes of the night. I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations.The party celebrated as it took control of Richmond by gaining 22 seats and had some other good results. Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, said: It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.” But elsewhere Vince Cable’s party showed no signs of enjoying the sort of recovery that would see it turn into a strong force at Westminster.Ukip\u0027s vote collapsed and by Friday morning it held just two seats, 44 down on four years ago. General secretary Paul Oakley tried to put a brave face on things by comparing the party to the Black Death. It\u0027s not all over at all, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that\u0027s exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn\u0027t finished because Brexit is being betrayed. Dan Sabbagh and Andrew SparrowThe prime minister toured areas where the Conservatives had made gains – or seen off Labour’s advance. Greeted by cheering supporters in Wandsworth, she said: “Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed.“We won’t take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.”May later travelled to Dudley, another Labour target held by the Tories, who were boosted by the collapse of Ukip. “We’ve seen great results around the country, not just here in the West Midlands, but in London. We’ve taken Basildon and Peterborough and we’ve shown what hard work by Conservative councillors can do in delivering for people.”Justine Greening, the former education secretary, said the results revealed that Labour had reached “peak Corbyn”, since last summer’s general election.In spite of May’s claim that she wants to “bring our country back together”, the results also underlined sharp isions between England’s towns and cities and between leave and remain-voting areas.Prof John Curtice, the elections expert, pointed out that the Conservative party appeared to have made gains predominantly in leave areas, as it profited from the collapse of Ukip. “The electorate that it now has is disproportionately a leave electorate,” he said.The Liberal Democrats also benefited from a Brexit backlash, with huge wins in two south-west London councils, Kingston and Richmond, in areas with a heavily pro-remain vote. The party picked up dozens of council seats elsewhere, from Hull to South Cambridgeshire, where they took control of the council. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the results showed “a return to three party politics.”Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan, warned that losing ground in Bolton, Dudley and her own seat of Wigan underlined the fact that Labour’s message is failing to appeal to voters in towns, where years of job losses have eroded the sense of community.“People have looked to politics for some time to solve this and seen us obsessed with a city-centric model, which is reliant on the benefits trickling down,” she said.“Unless Labour gets to grips with that, the next election is far from secure, with Labour piling up the votes in cities, and the Tories having a near-monopoly on the countryside.”She added: “Whoever gets this town’s argument will win the next general election and the one after that.”In London, Labour performed more strongly in boroughs where it already had a healthy lead over the Conservatives when the seats were last contested, in 2014.Judged by the numbers of seats, Labour put in its best performance ever in a series of outer London boroughs, including Ealing, Croydon, Enfield and Waltham Forest.But the biggest blow for the party came in Barnet, its main target in the capital, where it needed to gain just one seat to take control. Instead, the north London council moved into overall Conservative control, amid Labour recriminations about antisemitism.Andy Burnham, Manchester’s metropolitan mayor, said voters had raised the issue of antisemitism with him on the doorstep and it was time for Labour to “knock it out”.“It is clear that antisemitism was a very real issue in this campaign, not everywhere, but in areas where particularly there is a large Jewish community,” he said. “That is true here in Greater Manchester. If you look at the Kersal ward in Salford, I was out there myself and it was a pretty sobering experience, to be honest, because the hurt and the anger is painfully real in those places.“So what I would say back to Ken Livingstone and others who have made this argument that it’s all a smear designed to just undermine Jeremy Corbyn, let’s hope that these elections draw a very firm line under these arguments and basically knock it out, because the truth of the matter is there is a very real sense of rawness in the Jewish community.”Grassroots campaign group Momentum said its thousands of activists had helped to boost Labour’s showing in a series of key areas, including Trafford, in Manchester, where the Conservatives lost control and Wandsworth, in London.“We’re very pleased to see healthy gains in areas where Momentum campaigned hardest,” said Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator. “This shows just how important it is to have an engaged, enthusiastic movement - people who will get out into the community and spread Labour’s message.”While early predictions that Labour could take Wandsworth proved over-optimistic, Labour sources pointed out that a few hundred votes in several swing wards could have clinched it. Corbyn said his party had come “within a whisker” of winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eaee1a6eef9a5af752dc07cd95f78aab40fbb0/261_174_3135_1881/master/3135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d383bb10c2d78d64b0e11e9d8374b0b","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Electoral Reform Society releases figure as local elections in England bring mixed results for main partiesThe former cabinet minister, Justine Greening, has hit out at her party colleagues in the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG), accusing them of behaving a “little bit like Russia ... vetoing things that they don’t like” during the Brexit deliberations.The rightwing group, led by the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, must understand that “no one is going to quite get their perfect outcome”, the former education secretary told Sky News.The sooner they all realise that and then work through the give and take and find a sustainable long-term solution on Brexit, the sooner we’ll be able to get on with the implementation planning around that which is urgent, and the sooner we’ll be able to get on with running the country and get on with the domestic agenda - for me the equality of opportunity - and the issues that are really at the heart of what I think people want tackled.Asked if the ERG was being given too much attention, Greening said:Well look, I think what we can’t have is a group of MPs who behave a little bit like Russia does on the Security Council - vetoing things that they don’t like.We have got to go forward on Brexit as a country together. That will mean give and take and people need to understand that, whatever wing of my party they are on, and whatever elements of the LeaveRemain debate they are on. I’m afraid no one is going to quite get their perfect outcome.She also told the broadcaster she was concerned the Brexit war cabinet would find itself out of step with the Tory party when it discusses what sort of customs arrangement it wants with the European Union post-Brexit.I think it’s time for the moderates in the party like myself to work with the prime minister on a sensible approach to the customs policy and a broader package and then make sure this is something we can get through Parliament.Here’s an update on the 146 councils out of 150 that have declared so far:There is no overall control in 21 councils (-1)Labour retains Hounslow, winning 33 of the available 60 seats. The Conservatives have won six seats so far, with 21 still to declare.Here are some analysis articles about the local elections that are worth reading.The pendulum is stuck. The traditional laws of political gravity predict a swing away from the party of national government in local elections, but it has been a while since British politics followed the obvious arc of precedent.If last night’s council election results conform to any pattern, it is the laudable habit that voters have acquired of giving party leaders cause to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on. There is no big national winner. Since the Tories were braced for a mauling and escaped without one, Theresa May will be feeling relatively relaxed today. Labour needed to demonstrate that last year’s general election gains were a staging post on the road to national power that destiny was calling Jeremy Corbyn. Destiny didn’t hang up the phone, but it has put the opposition on hold. Labour had ambitious targets – Tory bastions in London such as Westminster and Wandsworth – that did not fall.One pro-remain Conservative told me last night’s results were “a bit of a disaster for our side.” He said they would encourage Tories to see Brexit supporters as their core demographic and prioritise pleasing them. At the same time, he worried, Labour would now feel it has to go hunting lost Brexit support to make up vital electoral ground outside London.The more hardline amongst the Brexit-supporting Tory MPs might be emboldened by the overnight results in some pro-leave areas of England. Those who have been waving around letters to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, calling for a vote of no confidence in Theresa May, could in the tense weeks and months ahead feel that throwing the pieces in the air and seeing where they land, even if it heightens the risk of a general election, is not such a risk as some have suggested and preferable to what they see as a heavily diluted Brexit.The Conservatives have so far made 163 seat gains and suffered 165 losses. As a result they will likely end the day with a similar overall tally as the one they started with. Most, 89, of the Conservative losses were in London, and most, 132, of their gains were outside London. This differential in the Tory performance is part of a broader pattern whereby the Conservatives won more votes and seats in places which were more supportive of Brexit. As a result, the councils the party has won (Basildon, Peterborough, Redditch) are all places that voted to leave the EU at a rate of 61 per cent or more in 2016.The exception to this rule tells an important story linked to the row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Of the wards across the country where the BBC collected the votes, Labour is up by just 3 points where more than 4 per cent of the population is Jewish, but the party is up by 7 points on average elsewhere. This correlation had a particular impact in both Barnet and Bury where the Jewish population is relatively large. That Labour not only failed to take its (notionally) easiest target in London, but the Conservatives actually managed to gain six seats and take control of Barnet (where 38 per cent voted Remain) is quite remarkable.I first advanced the theory that Labour’s electoral coalition might simply be becoming less likely to turn up in off-years under Ed Miliband as a possible explanation for why Labour were underperforming relative to the opinion polls. Of course, that wasn’t true in 2015, but it doesn’t mean it won’t turn out to be true in the future. Labour’s coalition has been getting younger, more likely to live in a city and more erse pretty steadily since 2001 and it took a big leap forward in that direction in 2017. My feeling is that at some point that is going to mean that the predictive value of local election performances at general elections is going to change and change big. We may have reached that point already, but then again it may not. Mr Corbyn has a proud history of leaving commentators with egg all over their faces. He can summon up charisma when he needs it and has an extraordinary ability to keep battling on regardless of circumstances. He also has some huge advantages on his side. A Tory party that is deeply ided over the most important issue facing the country an establishment that thinks that Brexit is a Tory-made disaster a generational ide that has left people under 40 struggling to get their feet on the property ladder and a widespread sense that the country’s infrastructure, from the NHS to the transport system, is on the verge of collapse. Even so, Corbynmania is now officially dead.That’s all from me for today.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over.The Electoral Reform Society has warned of what it calls a “dark day for politics” after saying that almost 4,000 would-be voters were turned away from polling stations for not having the necessary ID in the five boroughs which tested out voter ID schemes on Thursday.The scheme, which could be extended nationwide in future elections, saw varying ID requirements in Bromley, Woking, Gosport, Watford and Swindon.Critics had warned the trail was targeting a tiny problem of voter impersonation at polling booths, and risked putting off more vulnerable voters who might not hold the necessary documents, for example older people and the homeless.Britain prides itself on being a leading democracy – but it is a dark day for politics when thousands of blameless people turn out to vote only to be refused.Our estimates, based on evidence gathered by electoral observers, reveal the shocking scale of the problem. These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.According to the BBC, the Conservative party has reinstated a candidate who won a seat in Sunderland who had been suspended over offensive social media posts, including one about Diane Abbott from several years ago.Abbott has posted a message on Twitter suggesting this shows the Tories are not taking the problem seriously.Here are some results that have come in in the last hour or so.Cherwell C No change C 12, Lab 3, LD 1, Vacant 1 Boundary change Lab up 1, LD up 1, C down 1, Ind down 1 New council: C 36, Lab 9, Ind 1, LD 1, Vacant 1 Manchester Lab No change Boundary change LD up 1, Lab down 1 New council: Lab 94, LD 2 A former mayor whose reinstatement gave the Conservatives control of a council by one seat has “sincerely apologised” over a racial Facebook joke which saw her suspended from the party, the Press Association reports. Rosemary Carroll, who made a post comparing an Asian with a dog last June, rejoined “as the votes were being counted” on Friday, giving the Tories narrow control of Pendle council in Lancashire.The post was shared in error but Rosemary fully accepted the potential upset caused and sincerely apologised. Having served her suspension period she rejoined the party and completed additional ersity training.Carroll, a former mayor of Pendle who represents the Earby ward, previously said she meant to delete the post but accidentally published it in error. Leader of the Labour group, Mohammed Iqbal, said the situation was an “appalling state of affairs”. He said:Here’s a councillor who brought shame on the borough on an international level and was welcomed back into the fold with open arms simply to grab control to the council. She turned up with a Conservative rosette literally as the votes were being counted.Dan Jarvis used his victory after being elected as Sheffield city region’s mayor to call for a wider devolution deal for Yorkshire. The post has only just been established, and the job does not yet come with agreed powers, an agreed budget, or even an agreed salary. He said:I say this because I believe that the issue of devolution goes to the heart of two of the most important strategic issues that our country faces - how we respond to the causes of Brexit and how we prepare for a post-Brexit Britain. If we are to find the right answer to these questions we must be prepared to reform every aspect of our political system.Labour has retained control of Birmingham council, the Press Association reports. It has got 51 of the 101 seats, with 14 two-councillor wards yet to declare.Birmingham, which is the largest council in Britain, is one of the areas that has had all-out council elections (with all seats being up for grabs, not just the usual one third) following boundary changes.These are from the BBC’s Kathryn Stanczyszyn.Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister, has told Sky News that he thinks the election results amount to a “stalemate”.

Later, he was driven around London for part of the night by the taxi driver who brought him to the address after his release from detention. He was placed in a hostel as a temporary measure.The disabled man was initially supposed to be released from detention six weeks ago but the Home Office continued to detain him as they were unable to identify suitable, wheelchair-accessible accommodation.The criticism from circuit judge Karen Jane Walden-Smith, sitting as a high court judge, is likely to be the first judicial rebuke received byJavid, who only became home secretary on Monday following Amber Rudd’s resignation.The Official Solicitor is involved with the case because the man lacks mental capacity. The disabled man is Jamaican and has been in the UK for 17 years. He was granted leave to remain before serving two years and three months in prison. The nature of his convictions were not disclosed in court.Following his release, the Home Office opened deportation proceedings against the man. A psychiatric assessment found that he lacked mental capacity and had PTSD and a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.He had been held in detention since last July, although the Home Office accepted that he was an “adult at risk”. Following a judicial review launched by the man’s solicitors, the Home Office authorised his release from detention on 21March.However, he was not physically released from detention until the evening of 2 May, the day before a court hearing in the case. On arrival at his allocated accommodation that night, he discovered steps leading to the front door, which was not opened by the occupants.Shortly before 10pm the man called his solicitor using the taxi driver’s phone, who advised that he should be returned to detention so that alternative accommodation could be arranged. The taxi driver said he had no authorisation to do this. The disabled man complained of back pain as a result of the journey and waiting around, and requested an ambulance be called. He also became agitated and threatened to break the taxi’s windows.The judge criticised the “lack of clarity about what was happening”. She said that alternative accommodation was found but the man said it was not wheelchair-accessible, so he was taken to a hostel in south London for newly arrived asylum seekers, where he remains. The Home Office has not yet found suitable permanent alternative accommodation that has sufficient disabled access.She ruled that the new accommodation must be wheelchair-accessible and give the man easy access to a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. She said if the Home Office failed to comply, the man could bring the matter back to court.“The secretary of state has acted very much last minute, at the last hour,” she said.The Home Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd09ace9622e9c89f95c322158ef6575bfff14a/37_305_5139_3084/master/5139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc2ed21e5dc551644fe50f7a5ab7c7c","title":"mendelssohn bred for date with destiny kentucky derby horse racing","story":"A few weeks after cantering to an 18-length win on a dirt track, the colt trained by world-record holder Aidan O’Brien bids to become the first European winner of the US’s greatest race“It dominates their sport,” Ryan Moore said this week, “in the same way that Cheltenham dominates ours from January to the beginning of March. It’s their most important race, a really significant sporting event in their country and people really get behind it. From January through to the first weekend in May, the Kentucky Derby is what American racing is focused on.”It is a fair comparison in all but the intensity. Cheltenham is four days, 28 races and 70,000 racegoers on Gold Cup day. The Kentucky Derby, in which Moore will ride Aidan O’Brien’s Mendelssohn on Saturday, distils four months of trial races and building anticipation into 120 seconds of action, for a crowd of at least 150,000 people. On the first Saturday in May, Churchill Downs is, fleetingly, one of the great sporting crucibles, a place where racing history has been made for 144 years, two minutes at a time. Between them, Moore, O’Brien and Mendelssohn will never get a better chance to write a chapter of their own.There are no end of fables attached to the long list of Kentucky Derby winners, which includes such legends as Secretariat, Citation and Seattle Slew. Even the casual horseplayers here can tell you about the Curse of Apollo, named after the only horse to win the Kentucky Derby without having raced as a two-year-old. That was back in 1882, a few weeks after Jesse James was shot, and dozens of horses, including top-class performers such as Curlin and Forego, have tried and failed to emulate him since. Two more, Justify and Magnum Moon, are close to the top of the betting for this year’s race.But at least it has been done. The curse of the Europeans, however, is absolute: in 143 runnings since 1875, no horse trained in Europe has ever won the Kentucky Derby. Even the America’s Cup was finally unbolted from its display case at the New York Yacht Club after 132 years. The US’s greatest horse race has yet to cross the Atlantic.No previous contender from Europe, however, has arrived in Louisville just a few weeks after cantering to an 18-length win on a dirt track, boasting a pedigree that says Kentucky in every generation, or representing a trainer who has just set a world record for Group One winners in a year.Enter Mendelssohn, the strongest challenger from a European stable since at least 1992, when François Boutin’s Arazi set off at odds-on but finished eighth. Mendelssohn is perhaps an even stronger contender\u0026nbspthan Arazi, for all that he is not sure to start favourite. Arazi had undergone surgery to both his front knees before his run in Kentucky. By contrast, Mendelssohn’s passage towards the Bluegrass State has been serene.It has also been plotted very deliberately by one of the greatest trainers the sport has seen, from the moment he was bought for $3m (£2.2m) by John Magnier’s Coolmore syndicate at the US’s most\u0026nbspprestigious bloodstock sale. O’Brien has had a handful of runners in the race, but Mendelssohn, a dirt-bred colt whose half-sister Beholder was a five-time Grade One winner on the surface, was a Kentucky horse from day one.His price tag, which made him the top lot at the 2016 Keeneland Select Sale, was a gamble, but a carefully calculated one. Scat Daddy, Mendelssohn’s sire, was starting to become established as an outstanding stallion of dirt and turf horses when he died in 2015.The first prize in the Kentucky Derby is about $1.25m (£920,000), quite modest by global standards, but if a colt from one of Scat Daddy’s final crops could win, he would be worth tens of millions of dollars as a stud prospect. Justify, who will challenge Mendelssohn for favouritism in a 20-strong field, is another son of Scat Daddy who could be valued in the high eight figures by Saturday night.So the stakes could scarcely be higher as Moore and Mendelssohn prepare for an all-or-nothing race around a tight oval track where no favours will be asked or given. About 10,000 thoroughbred colts were foaled in 2015 in the US alone and just 20 three-year-olds will go to post with a once-in-a-lifetime chance to win a Kentucky Derby.Moore, who described his only previous experience of the Kentucky Derby as “the best day’s racing I have ever experienced”, must know that he will never have a better chance to win it.“It’s a very hard race for anybody to win,” he said, “and Justify has looked exceptional and Magnum Moon has looked very talented as well. We know what we want to do, but there are other people who want to do similar things.“But he’s bred for it, it’s an American pedigree and he’s meant\u0026nbspto do the job. That’s what he\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwas bred to do, to win the Kentucky Derby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a88ea87ea1ba1f0980ec2ab1274be4f93782c2/80_197_3383_2030/master/3383.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61dfdef3e10308e88cf33d781012a948","title":"newcastle premiership finale play offs wasps sale bath","story":"Dean Richards’ side have confounded all expectations and made the play-offs while Sale and Bath will look to do similar on Saturday and squeeze into next season’s Champions CupNewcastle were the first winners of the Premiership in 1998 but since then they have largely floundered in the nether reaches, spending a season in the Championship five years ago. Under Dean Richards the Falcons have taken to the air again, qualifying for the play-offs for the first time and enjoying their highest finish in the Premiership since they won the title.They face Wasps in front of a sell-out crowd at Kingston Park on Saturday with third place the prize. It is only the fourth time since they won the title that Newcastle have finished in the top half of the table, and the first since 2001-02. Richards, who took over when they were in the Championship, was this week rewarded with a contract for another three years. “When you go into coaching, you want to see yourself in your team,” says the Newcastle and Scotland hooker Scott Lawson, who arrived at Kingston Park in the same year as Richards, 2012. “What you get with Newcastle is Dean Richards, resilient, full of character and buoyed by spirit and belief. We work hard for each other, never give up and want to make every match count.”At the start of the season Newcastle were quoted at 300-1 to win the title and fancied to finish 10th, ahead of Worcester and London Irish, but they are two wins away from claiming the trophy for a second time. While they will have to travel to the champions, Exeter, or their predecessor, Saracens, in the play-off semi-final, the Falcons have the best away record in the ision this season with seven victories.“It makes such a difference to go into the final round of the Premiership knowing that it is not the end of your season,” says the 36-year old Lawson, who was in the Gloucester side that lost to a late Owen Farrell penalty in the 2011 play-off semi-final against Saracens at Vicarage Road. “It is one of the best I have had in my career with Scotland winning the Calcutta Cup and I want it to go on a few weeks longer.”Lawson is 37 in September but is not contemplating retiring. “I am enjoying it too much. Dean and the coaches have built a strong squad at Newcastle and we can push on from here. I never expected to be recalled by Scotland at this late stage in my career and it was down to the way we are coached here. I want to carry on because I love playing.”The way Newcastle reached the play-offs summed up their season. They were trailing in their last two matches, at home to Sale and at Leicester, both top-four rivals, late on but found a way to win. They were 10 points behind with 11 minutes to go at Leicester last week, but kept their shape to record their first victory at the ground for 20 years and with the last play of the match.“We keep going,” says Lawson. “While we have secured a top-four finish, it is important to continue the winning run against Wasps and taking it into the semi-final. We will be away and we will not be fancied to get to Twickenham but no one expected us to make the play-offs. We have achieved some notable victories away from home and whoever we face will not be taking us lightly.”As well as deciding who will finish third, the final round will confirm England’s final two qualifiers for next season’s European Champions Cup. They are currently held by Leicester and Gloucester but Sale, who face the Tigers, are in contention and Bath, who entertain relegated London Irish, have a distant chance.Gloucester will qualify if they lose at Saracens and finish outside the top six through the Challenge Cup having reached this month’s final in Bilbao, taking England’s number to seven."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23cb66c45ad44338a82117a5facbf49d0cd6ee0/17_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6250bd4cc14064151f08a530400f6a3","title":"victoria pendleton abandons everest climb on health grounds","story":"Former Olympic cyclist advised to cut short expedition due to effects of oxygen deprivationThe Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton has abandoned an attempt to climb Mount Everest after suffering from the effects of oxygen deprivation.The cyclist-turned-jockey had set out for the summit with the TV presenter Ben Fogle and had reached the mountain’s second camp, 21,000ft (6,400 metres) above sea level, after spending weeks preparing for the final climb.But Pendleton, 37, started suffering the effects of hypoxia and was advised by her doctor to end her climb. Fogle is understood to be continuing the expedition.“Unfortunately after much deliberation I have decided not to continue my endeavour to summit Mount Everest,” the Olympian wrote on Instagram.“The weather conditions have offered the possibility of an early summit bid, as a consequence I have been unable to adhere to the prescribed rotation program and keep pace with the team without causing concern regarding my health at the higher camps, due to my lack of adaptation to the extreme altitude.”Pendleton said she was “incredibly disappointed” not to complete the challenge, “as I feel in great physical condition and was moving swiftly and efficiently through the icefall and across the glacier”.She added: “Whilst we were working and moving I was really positive and comfortable.

So much so that I required a light flow of oxygen that continued throughout the night.Mountaineers are advised to carry oxygen bottles on high-altitude climbs to prevent hypoxia, which can be fatal.Pendleton is one of Britain’s most successful female Olympians, having won a silver medal and two golds. She retired from cycling in 2012 and is now is now an amateur jockey. She told reporters in December she was taking part in the challenge because she was “probably having a midlife crisis”.She and Fogle, accompanied by Kenton Cool, reached base camp on 21 April after training in Nepal, the Andes and the Alps.Before the trip, Pendleton said her husband, Scott Gardner, the former Team GB sports scientist, would have preferred her not to climb the summit. “In an ideal world, he would like to be able to stop me, but he knows that won’t make me happy,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3c0420c93747a0b90b0d1435c211d8da44bc55/0_100_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a7f38f673f0a6f8555741da592657","title":"rachael young interview nighclubbing grace jones afrofuturism","story":"This year, Black Panther put afrofuturism in multiplexes – and there are plenty more artists of colour exploring inner and outer space, like artist and playwright Rachael YoungMore than ever before, black people are telling their own stories on British stages. Plays such as Nine Night at the National – in which a Caribbean family prepares to bury their recently deceased matriarch – have gained rave reviews. Everyday depictions of black life are now celebrated. But what about extraordinary black stories?For Rachael Young, whose show Nightclubbing comes to Camden People’s theatre next week before heading off on a tour of the UK, incorporating the extraordinary into the everyday became possible with the help of one thing: afrofuturism. A term coined in 1993 by cultural critic Mark Dery, today afrofuturism is defined as “a movement in literature, music, art etc, featuring futuristic or science fiction themes which incorporate elements of black history and culture”.Keisha Thompson, whose show Man on the Moon used afrofuturism to explore themes of family and mental health, expands on the concept. “At its core, afrofuturism uses the black experience to create work that is otherworldly, cosmic and surreal. For me, it’s about creative freedom. Using political pain and channelling it. Taking the experience of being ‘othered’ and subverting it into something otherworldly. It’s about using the knowledge of our ancestors to battle the erasure that we experience on a daily basis.”In Nightclubbing, Young (alongside musicians Mwen Rukandema and Leisha Thomas) bounces between telling two stories. One is the life of Grace Jones, whose groundbreaking 1981 album gives the show its title. The other is the imagined biography of the four black women who were turned away from the London nightclub Dstrkt in 2015. The incident gained widespread media attention and kickstarted a conversation about the racist door policies of many London venues. Rapper Stormzy even dissed the club on First Things First, the opening track on his debut album. For Young, the afrofuturist themes she works with today stemmed from thinking about these women, their lives and what they could represent. “The show came from the club incident,” she says. “Knowing what it’s like to be a black person from Nottingham – where you’re basically invisible – it hit me because I was like: what is this nonsense? Then I started thinking about these women being dark-skinned. I was wondering about which women get to transcend these things, and I got to a place where I found Grace Jones. Growing up, Jones was always this person that was always breaking away from the norm and doing her own thing, and she has always managed to be authentic. She’s dark-skinned, androgynous, and as she’s always been ahead of her time, she can be – is – afrofuturist.”Afrofuturism has hit the mainstream more squarely than ever before. Science fiction writers such as Octavia Butler have gained newfound popularity as literary feminists strive to be more intersectional, while in music, artists such as Flying Lotus, Solange, The Comet Is Coming, Thundercat, Erykah Badu, Sun Ra and Janelle Monáe are all part of the movement. Then there’s Marvel’s smash-hit superhero movie Black Panther, which imagines an African country untouched by colonialism, and thriving, away from the world stage. Young calls the film “revolutionary. I saw these strong female characters, dark-skinned black women, as warriors and inventors, things that we don’t ever see.” For poet and performer Vanessa Kisuule, who is currently working on a play with “elements of afrofuturism in it”, the appeal the genre has for black artists is obvious. “Afrofuturism frees our mind from the shackles of what a black artist ‘should’ speak on,” she says. “It is constantly assumed that black artists can only offer narratives that are ‘gritty’, urban and from our direct experience. I suppose the assumption is that we are so bogged down in our perpetual states of suffering that we haven’t the scope to think of much else. It is precisely because of this sociopolitical framework that black artists can have the capacity to dream up alternate worlds where we can, momentarily, transcend our current reality.”For Young, using afrofuturism has been a way to allow her imagination to create a new normal. “I was asked the question recently: does your work try to rewrite history? No, it can’t. What is important is how you galvanise the energy from history to move forward with what you imagine that future to be like. And that’s why afrofuturism feels like such a simple but hopeful thing. To be able to read about all these inventors, to see black people in sci-fi, to dream. It’s this that gives me the impulse to say: OK, things can get better? It’s a long way off, but maybe we’re starting to take steps towards that happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3432bbca881c7efea8106aff6aad5936a15b6d/257_349_4138_2481/master/4138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59efc6977740193d3e8548ed80bb75f8","title":"sandra gimlets siri drama starring alia shawkat podcasts of the week","story":"Cariad Lloyd’s podcast about bereavement continues to impress, while Shawkat and Kirsten Wiig’s new venture is a high-quality thrillerIn a recent episode of her death-themed podcast, comedian Cariad Lloyd spoke about how awful her late father had been at talking about death, and the irony of her own capacity for the subject.

Lava spurted into the sky from the road and aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.Resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread over an area of about 180 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday. He said it sounded like a jet engine.Residents had been warned for the last week that they should prepare to evacuate, with officials saying an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres were providing shelter.Earlier in the week, a school in the Puna district was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain.Since Monday, hundreds of earthquakes – most of them about 2.0 magnitude – have been recorded in the area. The Puu Oo, which is a volcanic cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kīlauea volcano, began to collapse on Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into newly created underground chambers.Officials said it was impossible to predict how long the eruption would last.Jeremiah Osuna, who captured drone footage of the lava stream, told the Honolulu television station KOHN that it sounded as if someone “put a bunch of rocks into a dryer”. He said he could smell the sulphur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.The US Geological Survey said fresh cracks in the ground were reported on Thursday afternoon and hot vapour and lava began to erupt.The geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed below Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night. Hawaii County civil defence agency closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high.

The free tickets, worth up to £400 each, will be offered to any EU citizens who turn 18 before July as part of a pilot DiscoverEU scheme funded by the EU. With Brexit on the horizon this is the first and last year British teenagers can apply for the rail bonanza, which has just been launched in Brussels.“Any future participating depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” said Nathalie Vandystadt, the EU commission spokesperson for education, culture, youth and sport.The scheme has been masterminded by the German MEP and leader of the European People’s party in the European parliament, Manfred Weber. His long-term vision is to give a free Interrail pass to each child in an EU country when they turn 18 as part of a way of promoting cultural and social ties among EU citizens. “I am convinced that the ‘18th birthday’ Interrail pass for Europe could become a true flagship project for the development of a common European identity in ersity,” he said. Interrail was launched in 1972 with £27.50 tickets offering unlimited travel across Europe as part of a scheme by rail operators to tempt young Europeans to explore their home continent.The European commission and the European parliament hope to give those with the least chance of travel the opportunity for what they believe will be a formative experience of their lives.“Emotions and links between people is something that is also worth investing in. This is what the DiscoverEU project is about. The point of the initiative is to give young Europeans, including those who are not students, the opportunity to travel, discover the beauty and richness of our continent and meet with other young Europeans from all over Europe. I believe it can contribute to create a feeling of common amongst Europeans,” Weber said.The EU has earmarked €12m (£10.6m) for the for the pilot scheme this year with a further €700m pencilled in for the next seven years in the proposed EU €1.25tn budget for 2021-2027.The first application round for 15,000 tickets will take place between 12 June and 26 June. If successful another 15,000 passes will be released in the second half of the year. About 1,900 tickets have been earmarked for British applicants, with 2,500 for Germany, 1,960 for France and 140 for Ireland. Sources say these allocations may change depending on take up from each member state. Participants will be able to travel up to 30 days to up to four EU countries with rail and ferries included. Their trip should be connected to a place with a specific value in terms of European cultural heritage, European sites, places of historic interest, specific social or cultural values and traditions. Applicants will have to give reasons for why they should be awarded the Interrail pass and agree to act as European ambassadors by posting about their experiences on social media.

The second panel, entitled The Realities, has the same man on an island encircled by four sharks, symbolising “chaos”, “trade issues”, “economic uncertainties” and “job confusion”.Nath, who is based in New Delhi, said the idea for the cartoon came after reading about the Brexit debate in the British press.“As a postgraduate in English and American literature, I have an affinity for British and European culture and liberal viewpoints. I weighed up the pros and cons of Brexit and spread the message through my cartoon to the public.”A spokesperson for the Baden-Württemberg ministry of education, which designs and distributes the centralised written part of the exam, said the assessment was designed to test students’ knowledge of recent sociopolitical issues."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483510.1525377678!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse chief tony o brien should resign says vicky phelan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan. She says she had refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement in her case after learning that she was not the only woman affected. Photograph: Collins CourtsSpeaking on the  Róisín Meets podcast, terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan (43) said the situation was “disgraceful – it’s an absolute national scandal” and that she did not understand how Mr O’Brien could “have the balls to stay in the job at this stage”.Following a High Court case taken by Ms Phelan, it emerged that scores of women with cervical cancer were not told that negative smear test results they had received were in fact inaccurate and the revised test results were kept from them for years.Mr O’Brien is due to leave the HSE in July and has rejected renewed calls for his resignation in light of the controversy.“He may only have 12 weeks to ride out this storm and go off into the sunset with his big fat pension, but I just think that he should man up and actually accept that as head of HSE, the buck stops with him,” Ms Phelan said.Diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014 after a false negative result from a cervical smear that was tested in 2011, Ms Phelan was told in January of this year that her cancer was incurable and that she had between six and 12 months to live.“I really don’t think I’m going to die,” she told the podcast. “Some people might think that I’m in denial. I’m not. I know I’ve got a terminal illness, but I’m going to throw everything at it. That is the main reason I took this case.”Last week, Ms Phelan received a settlement of €2.5 million without an admission of liability, in her case against a US laboratory that was subcontracted by CervicalCheck, the national screening service. Her case against the HSE was struck out.An audit at CervicalCheck over the weekend found that in the cases of 208 women diagnosed with cervical cancer, an original smear test had falsely given them the all-clear.Ms Phelan said she had refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement in her case after learning that she was not the only woman affected.“When we found out there were other women involved, there was no way I could have ever sat on that information.“Even if they offered me a ridiculous amount of money, I still would never have signed a non-disclosure agreement because there was too much at stake for other women and for the future of the cervical screening programme,” she said.Ms Phelan said she hoped her case would not discourage other women from having smear tests.“You do not want to be in my position – it is not a nice place to be. I have seen women with terminal cervical cancer and it is an awful death,” she said.The Government is to establish a non-statutory inquiry to examine whether a commission of investigation into the CervicalCheck scandal is required. Ms Phelan has called for any investigation to be carried out in public.“What I do not want to see is a closed door, where this thing is done in private. Too much has been covered up as it is,” she told the podcast.“This needs to be public. If that means that we need to change the legislation to allow for that, I think it’s warranted at this stage because this is a national scandal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484453.1525447805!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervical screening labs indemnify state over three legal cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThree laboratories involved in the cervical screening programme have given indemnities to the State in relation to three legal cases being taken by women.

She was not told of the false test until September 2017. She is now suffering from terminal cancer.It subsequently emerged that many other women had smear tests reviewed but were not informed of the outcome.Following an audit last weekend, the HSE said in the case of 208 women a negative smear test result was reversed.In total, 162 of these women - 17 of whom are now dead - were not told.Earlier on Friday Sinn Féin said it planned to table a motion of no confidence in the director general of the HSE Tony O’Brien.The party has repeatedly called for Mr O’Brien to resign in the wake of the controversy.Mr O’Brien’s contract has director general of the HSE expires in July .In the Dáil on Thursday Tánaiste Simon Coveney declined to express full support for Mr O’Brien.“Tony O’Brien’s focus on providing as much information as possible and putting systems in place that can co-operate fully with that independent investigation is probably the best way that he can assist in this process, rather than stepping aside from it,” Mr Coveney said.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it had been “a dreadful week” for the health service and a “culture change” was needed to reform it.Mr Varadkar also said he was “absolutely open” to a public inquiry into the cervical screening controversy.He said a scoping inquiry would be carried out prior to the statutory inquiry to get immediate answers. He said 180 of the 208 women diagnosed with cervical cancer who should have received an earlier intervention have now been contacted.Mr Varadkar said he had been in touch with Ms Phelan on Friday morning and that she will be part of the scoping inquiry.“That scoping inquiry will find out as much information as we possibly can in a matter of weeks and then we will have a statutory inquiry,” he said.Mr Varadkar was speaking following the opening of the Springfield Academic Primary Care Centre in Tallaght on Friday morning.In a wide-ranging address, Mr Varadkar said: “I think it’s fair to say that this week has been a dreadful week for our health service, even more so for the women who are affected”.He said “at heart of it once again unfortunately was a failure of open disclosure by doctors and also a failure by senior management to make sure that that happened”.Mr Varadkar said while legislation will be brought forward soon for mandatory open disclosure in serious incidents, what was required was “a culture change” in the health service.The Taoiseach also said that an advertisement to replace Mr O’Brien will be posted within two weeks.“Tony O’Brien’s term ends in less than 12 weeks, he has stepped back from any other interests he may have and we expect him to focus fully on this issue and resolving this issue over those couple of weeks while we find a replacement,” he said.“We don’t want to leave a gap or lacuna at the top of the HSE, so we need him to focus on his job in putting this right over the next couple of weeks.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483064.1525359687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"photo shows extent of fianna f%C3%A1il party backing for no vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThirty-one members of Fianna Fáil, including deputy leader Dara Calleary and the party’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath, participated in a photocall in Dublin’s Merrion Square on Tuesday afternoon urging voters to oppose the proposition to remove the Eighth Amendment.

Photograph: Toni AlbirEPAThe Spanish government has vowed to block a reform approved by Catalan pro-independence parties which seeks to allow exiled former regional president Carles Puigdemont to be reinstated and govern from abroad.On Friday, the Catalan parliament voted in favour of a motion changing the law to allow candidates for president to take part in investiture ceremonies – and then govern – without being present in the parliament. The reform would mean that Mr Puigdemont, who is in Germany awaiting a decision on Spain’s request to extradite him, could be sworn in as president by video link or by using a colleague to represent him in the chamber.Mr Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia (JxCat), the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) approved the reform, with 70 votes, against the 64 votes of unionist parties. But the law is unlikely to come into effect, because the Spanish government has said it will appeal against it before the constitutional court, ensuring its suspension. The same court barred Mr Puigdemont from attempting to be invested as president earlier this year and the courts have blocked the candidacies of two other pro-independence politicians, both of who are in prison, on legal grounds.Despite the law’s anticipated failure, Mr Puigdemont’s supporters were defiant. “We won’t give up because we won’t give up in the prisons, in exile or in parliament or in elections,” said Albert Batet, of JxCat.Unionist parties criticised the law and the way in which it was pushed through parliament, which saw secessionist parties ignore a recommendation from the regional constitutional body.“It’s a law for a fugitive from justice, it’s illegal in form and content,” said Inés Arrimadas, leader of the right-wing Ciudadanos party in Catalonia.With the Catalan parliament unable to form a new government since elections in December, Madrid continues to govern the region having introduced direct rule since a failed independence bid last autumn.If a new regional administration is not in place by May 22nd, elections will be called for July.On Saturday, Mr Puigdemont is due to meet in Germany with parliamentary members of his coalition to discuss the stalemate and the prospect of a repeat of the election. The Spanish supreme court wants to try him for rebellion and misuse of public funds, although the German judiciary recently ruled out extraditing him on the first, more serious, charge.There are reports that, in a bid to avert an election, pro-independence parties will propose a less controversial candidate for president, such as Elsa Artadi of JxCat.Meanwhile, the Spanish education ministry is investigating complaints of pro-independence indoctrination at 24 schools in Catalonia.In one school in the town of Vall-Llobrega, a mother complained that her eight-year-old daughter was told by her teacher that “Spain steals from Catalonia and that is very wrong.” According to the same parent, children were taught to make ballot boxes and vote “yes” in them, simulating last October’s outlawed independence referendum.In a separate case, a public prosecutor in Barcelona is attempting to investigate nine teachers from the same school who have been accused of pointing out and humiliating in their classrooms the children of civil guards who attempted to prevent last year’s referendum."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

In that moment, nothing looked valuable.”Dangerously high levels of sulfur dioxide have also been detected in the air, the Hawaii County fire department warned.A plume of ash rises from the Puu Oo vent on Hawaii\u0026#39s Kilaueaa volcano Around 1,700 residents of Leilani Estates were ordered to evacuate on Thursday afternoon while some 10,000 people are in voluntary evacuation zones local officials said.Henry Calio said he first sensed danger came when he saw cracks had emerged in the driveway of his retirement home. His wife Stella then received a call from an official ordering them to leave immediately. They now worry their home will be destroyed.This is our retirement home, this is our retirement dream, Mr Calio said.Lava overflows from the crater rimAerial footage showed a curtain of fire snaking through a forest on the island, said resident Jeremiah Osuna.You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff, he told Honolulu television station KHON.Hawaii\u0027s governor has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard.The Kilauea volcano is one of five that make up Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, with a lake of molten lava at its peak and an eastern rift erupting near-continuously since 1983.However explosions along its two active rifts are rare. Asta Miklius, a geophysicist from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said there is no way to know exactly how long the eruption will continue.One of the parameters is going to be whether the summit magma reservoir starts to drain in response to this event, and that has not happened yet, Mr Miklius said.There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably... so we are watching that very, very closely.County, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. The Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) down the slope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The USGS had raised the volcano alert in the area from a watch to a warning, reporting that new ground cracks were discovered in the late afternoon.White, hot vapor and blue fume emanated from an area of cracking in the eastern part of the subision, the agency wrote.It emphasised that the early stages of fissure eruptions are dynamic, and additional vents and new lava outbreaks may occur.At this time it is not possible to say where new vents could happen, it said.The affected area is part of the Big Island\u0027s East Rift Zone, in which the Hawaii Volcano Observatory had identified magma movement and warned residents that seismic activities and eruptions could take place without notice.All areas bordering East Rift Zone at high risk for eruption, Hawaii County\u0027s mayor Harry Kim said on Twitter.US Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was mobilising resources, as well as monitoring for forest fires, power outages and water supply issues.Hawaii Island, or the Big Island, is the largest of the eight main islands that comprise the Pacific US state, an archipelago that includes hundreds of smaller volcanic islands.Wei, who moved to Hawaii from California - known for its high earthquake risk - said the eruption was almost a relief.People live here - the Hawaiians and local people have lived here forever, she said. You know what\u0027s going on we have warning systems. Everybody should be prepared.An ash plume rises above the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii\u0026#39s Big Island Most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been non-explosive, but a 1924 eruption belched ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo\u0027s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring more than 1,500 feet high.In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes. Please review our commenting policyUS ambassador promises to \u0026#39spread the word\u0026#39 about bravery of Scottish island as ship disasters rememberedUK\u0026#39s Washington ambassador slaps down French counterpart over British burning down the White House NHS breast cancer scandal: victims and families open upCanadian man retires on his birthday - and scoops a £1 million on the lotteryLocal elections 2018: the charts that show how London votedTheresa May urged to pursue hard Brexit after stronger than expected showing in local elections\u0026#39They left a baby as bait for soldiers - a dog dragged him away\u0026#39: Inside the orphanage rehabilitating Isil\u0026#39s childrenBreast screening scandal deepens as IT firm says senior health officials ignored its warnings White Helmets rescue group have US funding frozenWhat time is the Royal Wedding?

Thousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.Most breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.A record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Melanie McGrice, who was not involved with the study, said: “As a fertility dietician, I’m seeing more and more women who incorrectly think that they should be avoiding fruit in an effort to help them conceive.“This study demonstrates that fruit consumption is not only safe, but beneficial for most women to optimise their fertility.“Fruit is rich in antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals, and should not be lumped into the same basket as sugar and soft drinks.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The department’s top civil servants acknowledged the fear of some “clunky fixes” and that some functions would not be performed “as slickly as they are at the moment”. Both problems would arise if the government fails to secure an exit deal, or that deal is rejected by parliament, and it carries out its “no deal” exit threat.The committee demanded an update from Defra by next month, “in case negotiations break down”.“Given its poor track record on IT delivery, Defra must ensure it has the necessary resources in place to complete its IT programmes on time and avoid costly and embarrassing contingencies involving manual completion and submission of forms,” it said.Ms Hillier added: “Departments are under extreme pressure.

The Labour leadership and people around them have seen the signs for a long time and they have not acted.Mr Langleben called for Jeremy Corbyn to visit Barnet and apologise to the Jewish community.Thanks to all those who voted for myself, Humayune and Agnes today. It was the greatest honour of my life to serve West Hendon.I don\u0027t think I have ever felt more proud to live in Barnet. An area where race hate is punished by voters. https:t.coXYK5gNqsx9Labour group leader Barry Rawlings said: I must say that in some wards where there is a large Jewish community, it has made a difference.Of course the Tories did go hard in those areas on that issue, saying that if you vote Labour you\u0027re voting for Jeremy Corbyn, added Mr Rawlings.\u0027But to be honest most of the conversations have been about potholes rather than antisemitism. That said, we want people to know it is an issue we take very seriously in the Labour Party.Council leader Richard Cornelius, a Conservative councillor, also said voters were generally more concerned about local issues rather than accusations of antisemitism within Labour.It\u0027s things like potholes, the collection of their rubbish bins and keeping the council tax low, he said.Of course there is a concern about anti-Semitism in the Jewish areas, and of course there is a wider concern about more generally - people are horrified, and Labour have to address that.It\u0027s been very close.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsThe Conservatives controlled Barnet from 2002 until it fell back into no overall control this March when one of their councillors, Sury Khatri, resigned.They made concerted efforts to target wards with large Jewish populations in the wake of the controversy convulsing Labour.The breakthrough came when they took a seat off Labour in Hale ward and all three from the long-time Labour stronghold of West Hendon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.“These findings are exactly what many feared: that this draconian measure would result in blameless iniduals being disenfranchised. It is vital moving forward that these draconian trials are not a fait accompli for a national roll-out.”The figures did not take into account whether voters came back with the correct ID having initially been turned away. It is also impossible to know how many people were put off from entering a polling station altogether because of the new ID requirements.Democracy Volunteers, the UK’s largest election observer group, collated the figures while carrying out extensive observations of the ID checks in 243 polling stations across the five areas it was being piloted.John Ault, director of the organisation, told The Independent 10 voters had been turned away within a 45-minute period at one polling station in Swindon, and that the issue appeared to disproportionately affect ethnic minority voters.British voters furious at being denied right to cast ballot over ID“Obviously there were always going to be teething problems, but I also think quite clearly that if you – whether intentionally or otherwise – exclude 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population, that is a significant problem,“ he said.“The process was quite well-run. Staff were welcoming and generally helpful, they tried to assist people who didn’t realise they were required to bring ID.“But the problem is some people clearly weren’t able to produce it, and we don’t know how many people didn’t come because they didn’t have it in the first place.”Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, clamed it was “impossible” for the government to justify rolling out the scheme.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote,“ she said.“We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the Government to scrap their voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.”Campaigners had questioned the evidence base on which the trials were based. Figures from the Electoral Commission show there were just 28 allegations of impersonation in 2017 out of nearly 45 million votes in 2017 – or one case for every 1.6 million votes cast. Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.Senior officials in trials areas expressed their concerns about the trials, while the government was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority for pushing misleading figures to support the need for the pilots.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsA Government spokesman insisted the pilots had been a “success”.“Voter ID is an important step to ensuring the public can have greater confidence in our democratic system and the success of yesterday\u0027s pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take,” said the spokesman.“The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem. We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at an event to mark  Karl Marx’s 200th birthday at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally.

Germany secures \u0026euro9.5bn gas deal with Russia And it also questioned whether the United States is simply trying to prevent Russia from selling its gas to Europe so American firms can cash in instead.Michael Harms, from the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, said: It is often the case that American authorities are investigating and threatening large-scale, costly lawsuits in the US, and this way also challenges activity on the US market.\u0026ldquoThis is something businesses want to avoid.He warned the prospect of sanctions left a cloud of uncertainty over the future of the project.GAZPROMThe Nord Stream 2 would run under the Baltic SeaMr Harms told Germany\u0026rsquos main public broadcaster Das Erste: This is of course poison for any long-term strategic commitment.He added the Nord Stream 2 project was specifically referenced in sanctions drawn up by the US Congress.On the question of whether Washington was considering sanctions to benefit American-based gas providers, Mr Harms said: The United States government attaches great importance to the export of American energy sources and to the creation of American jobs.This is very unusual: the connotation that has been made there with the increased sale of American liquid natural gas to Europe is remarkably frank, which fits badly with a sanction package motivated by foreign policy.Nord Stream 2 is funded by Russian energy giant Gazprom and European energy firms\u0026ldquoWe are criticising that the goals are linked to business interests.Nord Stream 2 is a planned expansion of the existing Nord Stream pipeline which already runs along the same Baltic Sea route.The company behind the project says the pipeline will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by supplying lower-carbon fuel to the EU.Brussels has previously warned against its construction, arguing it will threaten the long-term energy security of the EU and allow Russia to command even higher prices for the gas it supplies to member states in the east of the bloc.AFPDonald Trump has criticised the prospect of Europe sending billions of dollars to RussiaNordic nations have urged caution against the project, saying it would allow Russia to cut or limit supplies to Western Europe - and Ukraine - if it wishes.And the United States has warned allowing billions of dollars of European investment to Russia would make a mockery of Western sanctions imposed for Vladimir Putin\u0026rsquos invasion of Ukraine in 2014.(Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg.)"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/appgrab5.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get all our great stories the way you want them with our new mobile app","story":"With an amazing new facelift, the new Sun Mobile app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own app.  Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere else.So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you and your friends, all the goings on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, and the juiciest real life or lifestyle features, look no further.And even more exciting new features will be following soon.All the latest UK and international news - the shocking, the funny, the tragic and the need to know.Dan Woottons Bizarre – for all the gossip on your favourite celebs, the stories behind your favourite TV shows and soaps plus second-to-none behind the scenes access.Money - the best deals and advice for you and your family.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown on the predictions and which were correct.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour also targeted Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.But results revealed Labour have failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster from the Conservatives, but they have gained Plymouth.The Lib Dems kept hold of Sutton, their last London council, and managed to snatch Richmond-upon-Thames.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.This morning Trafford turned red as the Conservatives lost their narrow majority but they held their majority on the other three councils.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Stockport, Dudley, Walsall, and North East Lincolnshire have remained as councils with no overall control with Newcastle-under-Lyme sill yet to declare.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that backed Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party also targeted Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.Basildon turned blue but Colchester and Portsmouth are still councils with no overall control. Pendle is expected to declare this afternoon.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 showed 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.The stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, as a large Jewish population could reject Labour over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.Prof Curtice was proved correct with his prediction for Basildon and Peterborough as both turned blue last. Pendle is yet to declare and Rugby stayed Conservative.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold on to Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn and Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.Ukips electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and all eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark and Tower Hamlets are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimated two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge and Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth and Hackney being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are committed to the highest standards of food safety and clearly we’ve fallen short on this occasion.We’ve spoken to the customer to apologise and to try and put this right for her.”Nestle said they had not received any complaints, saying: If the product was sold after its best before date we would always advise a consumer to return it to the retailer for a replacement.SMA is manufactured under strict regulations and includes a number of measures to ensure safety.

From that moment I knew I could never live like a normal person - I was now a daughter of the revolution.That same day as the violence in the square a Syrian army officer, loyal to Assad, was pulled from his car by armed men, and killed in front of his son and nephew.As the clock tower event had been a defining moment for Noura and the rebels, thousands of loyalists turned out at the officers funeral, showing their support for Assad and his government.Syria had been split down the middle.The anti-Assad rebels were united by their hatred of the president, but they were otherwise disparate, with different rebel factions clashing with each other as they pushed for their own kind of revolution.As tensions rose, and Assads army tried harder to suppress protesters, members of the movement started taking up arms to defend themselves.After six months of protests, a full-scale civil war broke out.Government tanks rolled into Homs, firing at ordinary Syrians and destroying buildings.Meanwhile, Western leaders, like then US President Obama, started calling for Assad to step aside.The United Nations arranged peace talks, but these went nowhere.Western leaders largely wanted Assad to step aside, but he had a powerful ally in Putin.The Russian leadership had long-supported the Syrian regime, with the USSR first establishing ties with the Syrian government in the 1970s.Assad refused to step down voluntarily, and his enemies decided they would have to make him resign.A rebel army, made up of civilians and led by soldiers who had decided to defect, was formed.They were called the Free Syrian Army (FSA) - and they set their sights on conquering the populous city of Aleppo.They thought that if they could liberate the city, they would quickly gain the upper hand, and be able to force Assad out by Christmas 2012.But it wasnt meant to be - the FSA were ill-equipped and struggled against the official Syrian troops.President Obama was reluctant to provide weapons to the rebels, but a clear line was drawn against the Assad regime - the use of chemical warfare.During this time, Islamist groups had also started forming their own armies, some funded by Gulf States like Qatar and some backed by terrorists like Al-Qaeda.By 2013, the rebels and government forces were stuck in stalemate, with some opposition groups fighting each other and Islamist groups fighting everyone else.Pro-Assad Iran and Russia stepped up their efforts to support the regime, fearing the US could sweep in and gain a foothold in the Middle East if the government fell.Hezbollah, the extremist Lebanese group backed by Iran, joined the Syrian Army, bolstering Assad - something the documentary describes as a turning point.As things became more tangled, the human cost was greater than ever, with six million Syrians displaced from their homes and many more trapped in Islamist rebel-held areas, slowly dying of starvation.Then - worst of all - that September saw destructive Sarin gas chemical attacks on civilians in Damascus.Many of the victims were young children - but although Assad had crossed a line, the West was reluctant to intervene, for fears of antagonising Russia and making the war worse.That would change with the arrival of a deadly new force – Islamic State.The group used the chaos to gain the advantage, fighting against both the government and the moderate Syrian opposition.On 4 March 2013, hundreds of people – a mix of radicals and moderate fighters - swept in to the city of Raqqa, driving out government forces.With nobody in control of the city, moderate rebels called for democracy while IS - which ended up getting its way - wanted Sharia law.The terror group tightened its grip, assassinating rival leaders and imposing their strict interpretations of Sharia law on the residents of Raqqa, making the city their de facto capital.Then IS began to take more areas of desert in the north of the country, also taking over the country’s lucrative gas and oil fields in these areas.Meanwhile, in the hotly-contested capital of Damascus, neighbourhoods became war zones.The Syrian army - fighting for Assad - was losing and desperately needed more men. With the help of Iran and Hezbollah, a new pro-Government group – the National Defence Forces (NDF) was started.In Aleppo, too, the rebels seemed to be winning.Government supporters controlled only a couple of streets, in a deadly tug of war with paramilitary groups. One told Doucet they were “living in a nightmare”.It was simply not just a Syrian war. With the interjection of these other groups, there were a lot of nationalities fighting. The front lines kept shifting for years while civilians gravely suffered.This lead to a major refugee crisis. People poured into neighbouring Turkey and Jordan, then headed to the West.The UN estimates 5 million people are refugees outside of Syria, while 6million have been displaced around the country.For three years, the US had held back from airstrikes against Assad – but they couldn’t sit by and do nothing while IS, plotting deadly terror attacks in the West, grew stronger.So in September 2014, they sent their first fighter jets to the country.Meanwhile, it looked as if the regime would lose control of Aleppo – many of the hard-line Islamist fighters joined the rebels there, and the rebels took the city of Idlib.This is when Putin came in to lend a hand to his ally, and by October 2015, the first Russian planes appeared over Aleppo.The UK was also pressurised into fighting - but against IS, rather that the regime.With a Commons vote under David Cameron, we vowed to launch targeted airstrikes against ISIS held territory and became one of the many nations involved in Syria’s tangled war.In total, the doc claims 75 countries have been affected by the crisis in some way: either by funding or supporting a group on either side, by taking part in strikes or through involvement with the displaced refugees.The whole time, the Syrian government had been bombing and besieging rebel-held areas, with many civilians caught in the crossfire.Aleppo was bombed heavily by the Syrian government, and by summer 2016, much of the city was in ruin.Russian and Syrian war planes pounded rebel areas of Aleppo, and the suffering of ordinary people was immense.“We expected death every day because of the huge amount of shelling,” one doctor tells Doucet.On 3 October that year, a chlorine gas bomb hit a hospital in rebel-held Aleppo in a targeted attack. “The smell of death was everywhere,” says one eyewitness.Three medical workers were killed, and many more injured. Witnesses blamed pro-regime airstrikes, and the same hospital was bombed four times in just a few weeks.The deliberate targeting of hospitals is a war crime – but the Syrian Government said Al-Qaeda terrorists were using it as a base in order to justify their attack. The medical staff at the hospital said this was untrue.By now, the Syrian army and its allies could sense victory.The rebels, fatigued and out-gunned, were losing ground - and on 22 December 2016 the four-year Battle of Aleppo was over, won by the regime.Clearly, Assad would not be brought down by military force.Yet, the war is not over. A new regime offensive launched earlier this year to take back the last of the rebel enclaves in Syria.And in April the suburban town of Duoma, on the outskirts of Damascus was targeted by a chemical weapon, killing 70 people.France, the US and UK launched a joint targeted airstrike against the regimes chemical weapons facilities in response - sucking the West deeper into the mire of a war which has cost so much already.Part 2 of Syria: the Worlds War airs tonight at 9pm on BBC2, and both parts can be viewing on BBC iPlayer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.In Birmingham, a traditionally Labour-dominated city, the Tories did better than expected, prompting suggestions they could take control, but Labour ended up hanging on.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With all but a handful of councils declared, Labour had gained 64 wards and the Lib Dems 61, with the Tories losing 20 - and Ukip almost totally wiped out.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Kingston and Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield city region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403461731.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather may day bank holiday 28c beach traffic","story":"Traffic is already building up on major roads across the country as sun-seekers race to coastlines to make the most of the balmy extended weekend.Steamy hot conditions on Monday will eclipse sunny hotspots across Europe, with temperatures in Benidorm forecast for just 21C.This afternoon is expected to be the busiest time on the roads with 2.9 million trips, peaking in the early evening.Rod Dennis, RAF traffic spokesman, said: Many will be keen to make the most of the early May warmth by escaping in the car to spend time with family or friends - especially after the recent chilly spell that even lead to some overnight frosts at the start of this week.

Can you confirm we’re cleared to land?”Officials allegedly confirmed that the runway was clear but were not aware the plane was lined up to land on the crowded parallel taxiway instead.The pilot eventually aborted the landing after his co-pilot ordered him to go around go around after the officer looked outside and noticed it didnt look right”.Air Canada has not yet disclosed if any action was taken against the pilot and first officer after both told air investigators they were left tired after manoeuvring around thunderstorms earlier in the flight.According to the NTSB report, the 56-year-old flight captain has 20,000 hours flying experience, and the first officer had 10,000.In previously released audio from the cockpits of aircraft on the runway at the time, concerned pilots could be heard exclaiming: “Air Canada flew directly over us”.Speaking to Mercury News, retired United Airlines Capt. Ross Aimer said the outcome of a collision of this nature could have been “horrific”.He said: If it is true, what happened probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history.If you could imagine an Airbus colliding with four passenger aircraft wide bodies, full of fuel and passengers, then you can imagine how horrific this could have been.This is pretty huge.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403438772.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lidl cannabis products europe switzerland hemp tobacco","story":"The sale of cannabis has been legal in Switzerland to people who are 18 and over since 2011, as long as it contains no more than 1% of THC -

Gordon, which vanished while travelling from Glasgow in Scotland to Australia in 1876, or the Magdala, voyaging from Wales to Indonesia.“For the iron ship, the barques Kooringa (1894), Lake Ontario (1897) and West Ridge (1883) are possible, with the West Ridge best fitting the evidence,” said Mr Anderson.The hull structure of the wooden ship and other timbers appeared to have totally degraded, leaving only the remains of its coal cargo and metal objects such as fastenings, anchors and fittings.“The evidence points to the ship sinking as a result of a catastrophic event such as explosion, which was common in the transport of coal cargoes,” said Mr Anderson.One of the most interesting finds was a large rectangular metal object, 6m in length, which initially generated excitement as a possible treasure chest.But it was later found to be the metal ship’s iron water tank.The second wreck was more intact, lying upright on the seabed with at least two decks and visible portholes at the stern.Dr Anderson said more work – and funding – is needed before his team can be certain over the identity of the wrecks.If it was a shipwreck that we could dive on ... wed be looking for any artefacts like ceramics or bottles or anything that could confirm providence, Dr Anderson added.These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean, theyre some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world, so we try to maximise any information.The wrecks of two other 20th century trawlers were also found but the Australian Transport Safety Bureau did not ask the museum carry out further research.When the sonar search first located the wreckage, it was briefly thought that the remnants of MH370 had been found.Hopes were dashed when high-resolution images showed that it was a ship rather than aircraft which had been discovered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Leakey said: “He did apologise to me for that specific remark afterwards, but not for his other highly personal insults, and it is intolerable.”Mr Leakey said: “This issue is now out in the open. It risks bringing Parliament, not just the Commons, into disrepute.For Parliament not to investigate rigorously sets a poor example it would risk putting this on the same radar as the expenses scandal.

We\u0027ve held Hillingdon, Barnet, Westminster.\"And outside of London, we\u0027ve made progress in places like Dudley and Walsall. We\u0027ve taken control in Basildon and Peterborough.\"And that\u0027s all the result of the really hard work of our councillors, our activists, our supporters and our revitalised campaign machine.\"But we won\u0027t take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.\" In the wake of rows over Windrush and Brexit, with the former precipitating the resignation of Amber Rudd as home secretary, the PM will take some encouragement from her party\u0027s performance.The Tories gained Peterborough, Southend and Basildon, the latter a result of capitalising on UKIP\u0027s demise.In London, the Conservatives successfully defended Wandsworth and Westminster despite Labour hopes they could take both.Kensington and Chelsea stayed blue, despite anger over the Grenfell Tower fire.London Mayor Sadiq Khan had said before the vote: \"There is now no corner of London where Labour can\u0027t win - and with enough hard work we can challenge the Tories even in their crown jewels of Wandsworth and Barnet.\" Meanwhile, Dudley remained in no overall control, but the council\u0027s Tory leader was confident a UKIP councillor and independent Conservative would join their group to hand them effective control.However, the loss of a number of councils to the Lib Dems in pro-EU areas will cause concern among the party\u0027s Remain wing.Labour\u0027s performance - which saw the party pick up more than 50 seats but only gain control of one city council - has sparked suggestions we have reached \"peak Corbyn\".\"Obviously, I am disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground, but if you look at the overall picture, Labour gained a lot of seats across the whole country, we gained a lot of votes in places we never had those votes before.\"Mr Corbyn said the party was \"ready for a general election whenever it comes\".Labour figures described their performance as \"solid\" and said the party had consolidated gains made in last year\u0027s general election.Many within the party also pointed out that by its calculations, close results in four wards meant they missed out on victory in Wandsworth by just 141 votes.But a number of disappointing results will give critics of the Labour leader fresh ammunition. In the Midlands, the party lost control of Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth and failed to take the target council of Walsall.Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the party in the Midlands and North had \"some big questions to ask ourselves\".Streatham MP Chuka Umunna told Sky News Labour should have been making \"much more progress\" given the Government\u0027s recent troubles - and called for a party inquiry into its performance.There had been fears Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism row would affect the party\u0027s performance in areas with a high Jewish population.The party failed to win control of the north London borough of Barnet, which, according to the 2011 census, is home to 20% of the Jewish population of England and Wales.Defeated councillor Adam Langleben said Labour had been \"punished\" by voters over what he characterised as the national party\u0027s refusal to confront the issue. Mr Langleben claimed Mr Corbyn did not even understand the problem and called on him to visit the borough and apologise.Deputy leader Tom Watson admitted the Jewish community had \"sent us a message\" and said Labour had lessons to learn.There was plenty to cheer for the Lib Dems, who gained Kingston, Richmond and South Cambridgeshire from the Tories amid signs of a Brexit backlash in some areas.The party, which saw a net gain of more than 70 councillors, also secured the Hertfordshire council of Three Rivers from no overall control."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/17/11/2048x1152/skynews-meghan-markle-father-tom_4168403.jpg?20171128092504 ","title":"meghans father to walk her down the aisle at royal wedding","story":"Explaining that both of Meghan\u0027s parents would have \"important roles in the wedding\", the palace said that \"on the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle\".The palace said it expected the journey to \"take them along part of the Long Walk, allowing members of the public gathered there to see the car as it passes\".It added that \"Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel\".There has been speculation over whether Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas, would be performing the traditional role.Some reports said Meghan was worried about how her dad, who is said to value his privacy, would handle the pressure.Other reports said the 73-year-old was \"excited\" and looking forward to the big day.Prince Harry is \"keen to involve his mother\u0027s family in his wedding\", it continued, adding that \"all three siblings of Diana, Princess of Wales will be in attendance and Lady Jane Fellowes will give the reading\".Harry and Meghan \"both feel honoured that Lady Jane will be representing her family and helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day\".While the wedding will be \"guided by tradition\", it will also reflect the \"personalities of Prince Harry and Ms Markle\".:: Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding dress and its place in royal fashion history In the week before the ceremony, more details about the bridesmaids and page boys, the florist and the baker making the wedding cake will be released.The full order of service will be published on the morning of the wedding.Members of the Royal Family will begin to arrive at 11.20am, prior to the ceremony at midday.Harry and his best man, Prince William, are likely to arrive by foot at the chapel\u0027s west steps.The palace said that would \"allow Their Royal Highnesses to acknowledge all of the people gathered in the Castle precincts, including the 200 charity representatives gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps\".The service will take around an hour."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-rokhsana-fiaz-labour_4300802.jpg?20180504182514 ","title":"new labour mayor rokhsana fiaz plots referendum on her role","story":":: Local elections: Mixed night for Labour and Tories:: Anti-Semitism row mars Labour\u0027s urban gainsAfter her victory, she said the council would \"not only look very different, but will be different with more transparency, accountability and residents involved in decision making\".Before voters went to the polls she said she wanted to increase council accountability, with the referendum to be held as part of a so-called \"democracy review\".:: Local elections - the results as they happen:: Labour and Tories both lumbering like zombiesMs Fiaz, who was backed by Momentum, was one of four Labour mayoral candidates to come out on top in London boroughs."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-moon-jae-in-kim-jong-un_4297243.jpg?20180430132719 ","title":"north korea resets clocks by half an hour to match south","story":"Today, the official KCNA news agency said: \"The time-resetting is the first practical step taken after the historic third North-South summit meeting to speed up the process for the North and the South to become one.\"The move puts both countries nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, eight hours ahead of the current British Summer Time in the UK.It is a symbolic step on the road to peace between the two nations, which have been on different times since 2015, when the North\u0027s regime was changed to \"Pyongyang Time\" in what was touted as a break from imperialism.Donald Trump also confirmed that the time and place had been set for his historic meeting with Mr Kim, but did not confirm the details.An inter-Korean summit at the end of April marked the first time in 65 years that leaders of the two countries have come face-to-face."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-prince-harry-meghan-markle_4288599.jpg?20180421121543 ","title":"royal wedding new details of meghan markle and prince harrys big day revealed","story":":: Prince George and Princess Charlotte will attend with their mother Kate, but newborn brother Prince Louis will not be there."}]
