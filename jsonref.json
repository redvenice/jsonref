Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d3d4281d35a5cd4d13f825772aeaf8689711df/82_385_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b275127616631b921dbcc7ee05c8d10","title":"ceramics michael evans london council flat dayabandu","story":"Michael Evans filled every available space with a treasure trove of British, French and Japanese works. Now they’re up for auctionUntil recently, one of the best British postwar ceramics collections was to be found on a council estate in east London. “It was a bit like walking into a reliquary,” says the ceramicist Annie Turner, a regular visitor to the two-bed flat. “You’d go into a pretty brutal-looking 1970s building and up a dull concrete stairwell and think, ‘Am I in the right place?’. Then you opened this door, and it was like entering another world.”Behind that very ordinary front door was a treasure trove. Mostly British, French or Japanese, around 1,200 ceramic works clustered on shelves, grouped on tables and desks, and even used as planters on the tiny balcony. Among the objects were key pieces by Lucie Rie and Edmund de Waal, and contemporary works by Turner herself, and Sara Flynn – two award-winning artists whose prices have recently risen sharply.This collection belongs to Michael Evans, a former mechanical engineer and local government officer, who has been known by his Buddhist name Dayabandu since his ordination in the early 2000s. Dayabandu’s interest in ceramics started 60 years ago when he used to visit two maiden aunts after church and admire their Doulton Lambeth stoneware pots. “They said they’d give them to me as soon as I bought my own property,” he told the i newspaper in one of his only interviews, back in 2004. The aunts kept their promise – though soon that property was more the home of the ceramics than Dayabandu. “They allow me to live with them,” he said. “People think I live in a store room.”But many of the pieces are coming to auction this month. Dayabandu has suffered from increasingly severe vascular dementia, and the collection – instead of being a pleasure – has become a burden.“He’d started getting concerned about it around 10 years ago, the same time his behaviour became more eccentric,” says his friend Clive Barnett, a textile designer who lives in Suffolk. “He knew he was becoming unwell. He wanted the work to stay together, but he couldn’t find anyone to take it on as a whole.” Indeed various museums were happy to cherry pick no one wanted the job lot. “He was very knowledgeable,” says Barnett, “but we never quite understood why he bought certain things.”Dayabandu’s friends describe him as anything from focused to intense to obsessive. His delight was in the ceramics themselves rather than their value or maker’s reputation. As he said: “I don’t buy for investment, I only buy what I like. I know people who regard their collection in financial terms – for the names on the bottom of their pots. For me, that’s not collecting for the right reasons.”Once he’d retired from his life in local government, the suit and tie was abandoned for jeans and leather jacket. He moved from Leicester to Sandwich in Kent, where he took a part-time degree in fine art at Canterbury and finished with a first.According to Barnett, his Buddhism followed a chance meeting with someone on Sandwich beach not long after the ending of a long relationship. He sold his house and downsized to the flat partly to release money to continue collecting, and partly to be near the London Buddhist Centre in Roman Road. He ate his lunch most days at the Cafe from Crisis in Commercial Street, where homeless people and ex-offenders are trained in catering. “Not the sort of staff you get everywhere – he liked that,” says another friend, Martin Pearce, a ceramicist, based near Battle.“He never did anything by halves, once he was interested he got really involved,” continues Pearce. “To be honest, he could be abrasive. He’d come to see me once or twice a month in my studio when I was still working in London, and criticise my work. But if he saw someone who was struggling or needed advice, he’d really take it upon himself to sit down with them, and spend time talking it all through.” Turner, another beneficiary of his time and interest, says she would spend a day at a time at his house. “We’d have green tea in beautiful hand-thrown tea bowls – everything was handmade,” she says. “He’d tell great stories about all the work in the flat he’d never buy anything that didn’t ‘speak’ to him.” His preference veered towards the natural, not the decorative, ceramic tradition one can see the appeal of Turner’s exquisitely controlled and austere work inspired by the natural fragments she collects from the River Deben in Suffolk.Once when she was installing a six-part piece on his kitchen wall, and having trouble doing so, she recalls how he walked past and stopped in the corridor. “He just said: make sure you’ve got the nails exactly straight. He was an engineer – he could tell what I was doing wrong. But he just gave me the advice from a distance. It was kind, he didn’t want to make me feel stupid.” (The piece is in the auction, with an estimate of £800-£1,200.) Turner recalls the flat as full of big dark furniture. “There was even a big four-poster bed with curtains around it. He just wasn’t afraid to fill up space,” she says. “And maybe I shouldn’t say this, but there was always a big spliff, ready rolled for bed time. He often had a lot of pain,” she says. Martin Pearce says that “he loved the austerity of Annie’s work, the absolute control and the links with the River Deben”. Dayabandu went there often on Buddhist retreats.After being given his aunts’ Doulton Lambeth pots, he went on to collect Moorcroft – 20th-century British hand-painted pottery with vibrant high glazes – and then, having become increasingly enamoured of more contemporary works, he sold the lot. Moorcroft had become sought after, and it was a handy way to finance this new strand of acquisition.“He liked being able to visit the potters, and going to fairs and open studios and talking to the makers,” says Pearce. “In a way, he was really interested in people.” The gallerist Matthew Hall, of London ceramic specialists Erskine Hall, agrees, adding: “He was always looking for the connection to the maker, an entry point to the life behind the work.” Hall also visited the east London flat and remembers looking at the Buddhist shrine that Dayabandu had created there. “There was one object, a brick from the exterior of a Buddhist temple that was at least 1,500 years old. It had the figure of a robed monk on the front,” says Hall. “But then he picked it up and turned it over and there was the impression of the craftsman’s hand on the back. He put his own hand in that handprint. It made so much sense.”Marijke Varrell-Jones, the founder of MAAK, the auction house organising the Dayabandu sale, says that this won’t be the first time she has broken up a collection. “They are transient things in the end,” she says. “And you have to remember, these pieces didn’t start out all being together.” MAAK – which specialises in ceramics and has offered a very slick online platform since it started in 2009 – will be offering nearly 200 lots in the auction Unifying Eye: The Dayabandhu Collection, including some by Akiko Hirai, another rising star. “He came to my studio a lot,” Hirai says. “He was always looking for movement, for something kinetic and tactile in a piece of work.”Dayabandu was amassing his collection in the noughties, a time when work by postwar practitioners including John Maltby, Ewan Henderson, Ian Godfrey and Gordon Baldwin was still affordable. “It’s a reminder that what counts in forming a collection is the depth of your eye and enduring curiosity, not the depth of your bank balance,” says Hall. “He didn’t spend excessively on a single item.” So he would most likely be rather surprised by the results that are likely to emerge in May. Works by Lucie Rie have sold for upwards of £150,000 in the last few years John Maltby and Ian Godfrey are highly sought after by younger collectors including Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of Loewe, who has himself found a passion for pots. “We saw a real change around 2016,” says Varrell-Jones. “Our clients used to be couples of a certain age, who’d retired with a disposable income. Now it’s younger collectors who want to live with handmade objects. And besides, there’s room on a bookshelf for a pot.” Or for 1,200 of them, if you happen to be Michael Evans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89be8fd25e6f86ecdd0bad8366921bfb8b3d132/0_0_2163_1442/master/2163.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8acafb50e35d185ddc78a81609f3a6a9","title":"tolstoy steinbeck defoe why are so many turning to classic novels","story":"As sales of literary heavyweights soar, Booker winner Penelope Lively says that getting lost in a good book is now more relevant than it has ever beenThere aren’t many aspects of the lockdown that the author Penelope Lively enjoys but reading Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to her 27-year-old granddaughter on video calls is one of them. “We discovered that for some extraordinary reason she’d never read it in her childhood,” Lively says. “So we’re each taking it in turns to read a bit to each other – and thoroughly enjoying it.”Isolated in her home in north London, Lively, an 87-year-old widow, has also been scouring her own bookshelves for classic novels she can read alone. Currently, she is devouring all of the Irish writer William Trevor’s books: “I suddenly realised there was a lot of him I’d never read, and I’d almost forgotten how amazingly good he is.”For Lively, who is probably best known for her 1987 Booker prize-winning novel Moon Tiger, there is no better antidote to the lockdown than a classic novel. “It’s that old cliche of getting lost in a book. You want something that you can get immersed in, that takes you out of what is an extremely difficult time for all of us – and a lot of classic novels do that.”She should know. Lively is one of the few authors alive whose books are published as “modern classics” by Penguin. It is an honour she did not expect. “When I look back at the sort of ‘other person’ I was when I wrote Moon Tiger ... that person would certainly have been astonished to be told that, in 30-odd years’ time, it would be seen as a classic.”Fiction also offers an easy way to leave the lockdown behind. “Reading is always, in one sense, a form of escape,” says Lively. “It’s escaping into a life which is not the life that you’re actually having to live. That’s why we do it.”Lively has often followed the English tradition of saying serious things in a relatively lighthearted way. She recalls reaching for classic novels by other authors who did this – Elizabeth Bowen and Graham Greene – whenever she lacked insight into her feelings as a young woman. “We go to fiction to discover how fictional people in literature may have reacted to the same sort of experiences we have, such as loss and death – and love.”Personally, she is finding the lockdown “extremely depressing” and feels “very sorry” for the young, who are missing out on both job opportunities and the social life they should be having. “But I also feel sorry for my age group, because we’ve only got a few years left. And at least one of those years – possibly more – is being effectively taken away from us.”She has not found the pandemic conducive to writing, but does take comfort in her garden. She also makes time to read every day. With all forms of entertainment outside the home shut down, time-consuming classics seem more attractive than usual. “It’s interesting that they’re all rather sombre books, as though people are looking for books that reflect the sombre time that we’re in,” says Lively. “I’m a great believer in the sense that you can learn lessons from history. And that spills over into the reason that we read fiction and what we’re getting out of fiction. We’re experiencing a different slant on life. And that will affect how you then look at your own behaviour, and your own life.”Lively thinks the uplift in sales of classics suggests people are trying to spend their time productively. “They’re thinking: these books are always said to be amazing, now’s my opportunity to read them.”But not even she thinks it is possible to survive on a diet of classics alone. There is one other thing she recommends: “A glass of wine in the evening. That helps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06930574e42889fe7e04e97ec7f9215d64b2df36/0_182_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36feb7b5114f3e8272243c8d0ecb9805","title":"collective action coronavirus recession inequality living standards","story":"There are reasons for optimism as the UK economy and much of the rest of the world plunges into recession. That might seem like a bizarre statement when the recession is forecast to be the deepest in several centuries.Yet there are several arguments for remaining hopeful. Looking back, it is clear that previous pandemics have reduced inequality. And this one could, at least in the short term, be no exception. As the Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton has written: “It is an equal opportunity infection that does not pass over world leaders, senior politicians and celebrities.”Writing in the Financial Times, the Harvard economist Amartya Sen, another Nobel prize winner, says there is room for optimism as collective action is appreciated (rather than being denigrated as the first steps towards communism). “The need to act together can certainly generate an appreciation of the constructive role of public action.”The Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is another who is hopeful that collective action will be appreciated long after a vaccine is found for Covid-19. His emphasis is on voluntary groups and the spontaneous urge of the community-minded to come together, appreciating the need to take on issues such as climate change, or to care for those less well equipped to deal with modern life.Of course, any action to improve living standards and general wellbeing once the lockdown is lifted will need money, and the potential for governments to access plentiful funds is another reason for optimism. After the 2008 financial crash, the largely conservative governments that ran the developed world were emotionally averse to persistently high levels of debt, even when their purpose was to spur a recovery and ultimately reduce the debt as a proportion of national income (GDP).A pandemic means all countries must raise funds on the debt markets to bail out vital industries and prevent mass unemployment. The bond investor has nowhere to go other than to lend to highly indebted governments. Another factor determining the impotence of these investors is the crazy risk of switching their funds into equities when so little is known about which companies will survive and prosper in the post-pandemic age, Amazon notwithstanding.There is a cost to this, which is the investment returns usually enjoyed by pension funds in the developed world, including those in the UK. They are the major bond investors, along with Middle East sovereign wealth funds, that must accept lower returns for lending governments their savings.For a long time now, pension funds have wrestled with how to match steadily declining returns with unreasonable demands from savers for sky-high retirement incomes. The post-pandemic world is going to make that circle even harder to square.And this problem is not a side issue. Unless governments can work out a way to persuade older voters that their best interests lie, not in protecting their house prices and pension entitlements, but in rejecting austerity to favour a world where their savings are put to use – in part, to enhance health and social care – for them and their families, spending cuts and higher taxes will be the result.Deaton and Sen are ultimately gloomy about overcoming the long-term drift to inequality. For the British, who must soldier on with Boris Johnson as prime minister, that concern must be writ large.Let’s hope the old, who traditionally vote Conservative in droves, see that the collective response to the pandemic should be maintained, not least for their own good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6743e39a1e685e89240241a9ff293d02b92f0fc4/0_1314_2475_1484/master/2475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad91c645d25c8440fff251266182a361","title":"brent underwood trapped in a town with only ghosts for company","story":"The winner of this week’s edition of Coronavirus: Would You Rather narrowly beat a few other very unfortunate peopleA few weeks ago, a man called Brent Underwood arrived for a week-long stay in the uninhabited town of Cerro Gordo, California, which he bought for £1.1m in 2018.He sent the live-in caretaker of this former silver mining resort home when the pandemic began to bite. Then the virus chomped down on the US, it began to snow and Underwood has been trapped there alone for over a month, boiling snow for water. The ghost town is, of course, also haunted by the spirits of dead children. “For the most part, I leave the ghosts alone and they leave me alone. I try to respect their space,” Underwood told the NY Post. If he can only have a go at respecting the ghosts’ space while self-isolating in an empty town, imagine being cooped up with him in a city flat with no garden.There are lots of stories such as Underwood’s doing the rounds. Well, not quite like Underwood’s, because the supernatural element really does give his snowed-in spooktacular an extra show-offy kind of edge, but there are plenty of people who have found themselves stuck in places they did not expect to be stuck in. I am fascinated by each and every one of them and collect them like Panini stickers for my Covid-19 album. There are the low-level modern urban legends, of couples who decided to shack up together permanently, speeding up their courtship, Catastrophe-style, after only a date or two. The bands who were away recording and now have to share a bedroom indefinitely. Then there are the big ones: the couple on honeymoon who found themselves stranded in a fully staffed resort, unable to stop being on holiday. Chris Lewis, an ex-paratrooper, was on a fundraising mission to walk the coastline of the UK he has been on lockdown with his dog on the uninhabited island of Hildasay in the west of Shetland since the end of March.It has turned into a game of Would You Rather: would you rather be the couple travelling the world on a yacht, who told their friends that they didn’t want to hear any bad news while they were away, so have only just found out that something pretty, pretty bad had been happening while they were accidentally isolating in their watery fun bubble? Or would you rather be dodging the child-ghosts as you contemplate a 26-mile walk through snow to the nearest town, which doesn’t even have a grocery store? For many of us, not having any outside space has been a challenge these past few weeks, but it’s always nice to put it into perspective.All Stanley Tucci had to do was show the internet how he makes a negroni and it was putty in his hands. The actor’s home cocktail-making lesson sent the internet wild last week, which must make him wonder if it’s worth spending months making a feature film, when simply discussing the benefits of a good-quality sweet vermouth earns the equivalent of five-star reviews from seemingly every heterosexual woman on the planet. And the award goes to Stanley Tucci’s tight black polo shirt and thoughts about gin versus vodka, indeed.Children are getting the best of celebrity attempts to serve some educational purpose during the crisis. Brian Cox is teaching them about space and David Attenborough about geography, with a possible side serving of how not to chuck plastic bottles into the sea. Mabel is teaching music and reading. Tom Hardy is doling out the bedtime stories. It’s hard enough to be stuck at home when you can rationalise the importance of sticking to the rules, but it must be impossible to see the rationale for anything when one minute you were at school and the next Danny Dyer is teaching you history.In an era that is not proving to be a strong advertisement for unfiltered celebrity content for grownups no, please show me how you look with nothing but a pillow in front of you – the calm art of mixing a drink is the kind of unfiltered celebrity content to aspire to. Do we adults not deserve Tucci’s cocktail masterclass? I’m a lightweight who gets dizzy from a sniff of Coors Lite, but Tucci made me salivate over the thought of having a negroni out in the wild once again.Discovering that Fiona Apple had named her new album after a line uttered by Gillian Anderson’s character in the BBC2 drama The Fall – she says “fetch the bolt cutters”, as she is about to rescue a kidnapped woman – is another to add to the mental library. I look forward to the day Missy Elliott releases a track about Happy Valley. Come to think of it, I very much would look forward to that day.Fetch the Bolt Cutters is as remarkable as all the rave reviews would have it. There are usually a handful of records a year that take me back to teenage levels of obsession, of poring over lyrics and relistening and consuming, and this is one of them. Apple told NPR that it was supposed to come out in October. “I felt like, well, why wait that long?” she said. It is an untethered record that conjures up freedom and the fact that it does so in this impossible era, without inspiring a drop of resentment for it, is all the more extraordinary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a50187150eb0231f3c798c3140d31c3caee84b7/18_0_563_338/master/563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2020923f93a82a18fce6f7e63eb6dd1d","title":"social media no longer tolerates toxic lies dont believe a word of it","story":"Conspiracy theories put lives at risk. But how much do Google and Facebook care?The tech companies insist that the corona pandemic of 2020 will not be a repeat of the US presidential election of 2016. With millions of lives at stake, economies collapsing and hunger spreading, they will not rake in the advertising revenue generated by fake news and Russian disinformation this time round. They are responsible corporate citizens. Or so they wish us to believe.Early in the lockdown, YouTube and Facebook made a great fuss about removing a David Icke video in which he claimed the coronavirus wasn’t a virus but a sinister sickness spread by 5G networks. Asked about attacks on phone masts by his confederates in duncery, Icke didn’t fall over himself to condemn them. “If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision.”Facebook said it was “committed to removing misinformation which could contribute to physical harm” as it took down the interview with Icke and the London Real conspiracist site. (There’s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with “conspiracy theories” and did the same.They weren’t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully exploited, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled “Is There a Virus?” that YouTube had not taken down. Icke’s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. “They” were “redesignating” deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains. And why would “they” go to the time and trouble of doing that? Because “they” want to “destroy independent income” and impose a “massive fascistic global Orwellian control of the population”.I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp.I can’t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, the far-right fop Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure. Twitter banned him in for leading a pile-on against a black actress, and its censorship finished him off. If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed “liberals” have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their “hate speech” laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent.Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have physically attacked phone masts. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King’s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose a physical risk to public health. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring.They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom sanctioned a tiny TV station called London Live because it broadcast Icke “casting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus”. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale.Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech. But they have no obligation to help turn their countries into morgues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b6edcd33211629a765f12561fa0cad06366dde/0_104_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301d29779a0cc2d1e3b02e5bd71f22d0","title":"degrees of separation can universities adapt in the rush to online learning","story":"A potential £1bn bill now faces the sector, but the real problem will be maintaining quality for students in a radically altered world this SeptemberUK universities need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to deliver degrees online, with warnings that many are unprepared to deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on students’ education.Only around 20 universities are in a good position to provide a range of high-quality online courses by the start of the new academic year in September, according to Prof Sir Tim O’Shea, the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University. Some of the country’s top-ranked Russell Group institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge, were not in that category, he added.The warning comes as the sector seeks to expand online education in a bid to offset huge losses from tens of thousands of international students cancelling their studies due to Covid-19. Prolonged social distancing also mean freshers could face a radically different university experience, with no lectures on campus and bars closed.Most universities would face costs of at least £10m to create five or six new online degrees in different faculties, said O’Shea, a leading expert on computer-based learning. This would total well over £1bn across the sector.The costs will add to the financial pressures facing universities, with a report from the University and College Union (UCU) forecastingthat the sector could lose around £2.5bn next year in tuition fees alone if the pandemic continues.O’Shea recommended that universities focus on providing the first-year courses for up to five faculties, at a cost of £3m to £7.5 m. His stark assessment came as Durham University stalled controversial plans to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing next year. The proposals, drawn up by senior managers and private provider Cambridge Education Group Digital, said lecturers would only need six hours of training, and could create online degree modules in six to 12 weeks.O’Shea described Durham’s proposals as “hopelessly unrealistic”, adding that it was “quite impossible” for universities to deliver new online courses for this September unless they were already running successfully elsewhere. Even those universities with existing online provision would need 12 to 18 months to deliver new courses, he added.Private education firms said they have been inundated with requests from universities to help them deliver online education next year. Online learning platform Coursera has received at least 29,000 inquiries from more than 6,000 universities in 120 countries since the pandemic began.“We’re hearing from lots of universities that are facing major budget cuts, so even if they are planning to move all teaching online, they don’t have the core infrastructure to do this,” said Coursera’s chief enterprise officer, Leah Belsky.Many universities would also balk at sharing student fee revenue with private firms, Morris added. But the costs to universities of developing digital education in-house are huge. The deputy vice-chancellor of Coventry University, Ian Dunn, said it took two years and “tens of millions of pounds” to deliver 19 fully online degrees since 2017.O’Shea ided the UK universities into four categories: those with the capacity and will to develop high-quality online education, including the Open University, King’s College London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Coventry those with the capacity but not the will, such as Oxford and Cambridge those with the will but not the capacity, such as Durham and those with neither the will nor the capacity, such as art schools and music conservatoires.Some subjects, such as the sciences, would be particularly difficult to shift online. The Open University launched its OpenSTEM Labs in 2015, providing students with remote access to laboratories and observatories via remotely-operated robotic instruments. But experts noted that no other UK university has comparable provision.Aris Katzourakis, co-president of the UCU branch at Oxford University, said staff would in many cases not be able to replicate laboratory classes online. The zoology professor added that “these elements will not be taught to students to the same level”.In a blog this month on the impact of the coronavirus on higher education, the former universities minister, Jo Johnson, wrote that the crisis has exposed how many UK universities lagged behind their international competitors in developing online learning and were “clearly scrambling to provide anything resembling a coherent online offering”. Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University, said there was a danger that university senior managers underestimated the difficulty of delivering learning online.Weller said lecturers have told him they have been given a week’s notice to put their course online, and a fortnight to develop a digital strategy. He said: “A danger might be that we see a backlash against online learning because people rush to do it and it’s done badly.”Diana Laurillard, professor of learning with digital technologies at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the shift to online learning required a complete overhaul of traditional higher education. One-hour lectures and workshops would need to be broken up into smaller 10-20 minute webinars, interspersed with practical exercises, question-and-answer sessions and discussion groups.A spokeswoman for the National Union of Students said: “It is obvious that, regardless of quality, online learning simply cannot replicate the laboratory-based or practical learning of many courses.”An Oxford University spokeswoman said its staff have rapidly “bought into the idea that we can deliver teaching and assessment entirely remotely”.Prof Graham Virgo, senior pro-vice-chancellor of education at Cambridge University, said it had taken steps to increase online learning, including a partnership with private education firm edX. He added: “The university is developing ambitious plans to expand its online provision.”Prof Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said it was preparing to teach all courses on campus in September “while also ensuring that teaching can go online if there is a lockdown later in the year or in 2021”.A Department for Education spokeswoman said it was “delighted to see so many providers developing innovative ways of providing quality education, online and remotely”.Marcus Matthews, a final-year history student at the University of Southampton.“It has been quite disappointing, specifically from my faculty, the extent of the response to this crisis, although my degree has limited contact time anyway – it is mainly discussions in the two two-hour sessions we have per week.“In order to replace this, all we are now doing is posting at least three comments on an online discussion board per session. It is now a case of ‘do the reading, post your comments’. There appears to be no form of moderation.“This decision was made without consultation with students, and also the faculty stressed in an email to bear with the staff as they are having to deal with new technology such as ‘phone, Skype and Microsoft Teams’.“This is at a Russell Group uni. There is effectively no incentive to partake in this online learning, as it is in such a simple and condescending format with no consequence if we do it or not. As of this week, only one student has contributed, with one comment. It has effectively ruined the last five weeks of learning of what otherwise would have been an interesting module.” Rachel Hall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd5e2a0079aa6967e89d4e686f5029460774b81/0_273_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9175d7d7f3e2f114b3088ed3f629ffb8","title":"manchester university braced for losses of more than 270m","story":"Vice-chancellor warns of possible pay cuts and job losses in wake of pandemicThe vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester has said the institution faces losses in excess of £270m next year if students cancel their studies because of the coronavirus pandemic.Prof Dame Nancy Rothwell told staff that job losses and pay cuts might be required, along with “rapid and radical changes to our university and the way we operate”.Her stark assessment came after a report from the University and College Union (UCU) forecast that the sector could lose about £2.5bn next year in tuition fees alone, along with the loss of 30,000 university jobs if Covid-19 continues unchecked. Earlier this week,Imperial College London warned of widespread cuts to mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic on the institution.The drop in student numbers would also significantly reduce revenue from the university’s halls of residence, with further losses expected in catering, other commercial activities, and research income, she added.“We will need to cut our costs very significantly,” said Rothwell.In an attempt to mitigate its losses, the university was looking into allowing students to defer the start of the new academic year, or to let them begin in either September or January. It might also sell some of its assets.The university has already incurred additional costs since the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly due to the additional IT infrastructure need to provide online lecturing and research.Rothwell said she wanted to give staff an “early and honest view of the current and likely future severe financial impacts of the pandemic”, which has led other universities to predict huge losses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The UCU, which represents lecturers, said it recognised that the sector could face huge potential financial problems, but urged the university to halt plans to cut jobs and pay.Martyn Moss, UCU regional official for the north-west of England, said: “We are disappointed the University of Manchester has acted with such haste to threaten these drastic measures, especially when staff have adapted so impressively to the current crisis to support students and the university.“There is no denying that universities are facing new challenges in light of the crisis, but instead of short-sighted cuts, we need the sector to pull together and make the case for vital funding to safeguard the future of our universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f48f074c4aee1807440a7197ee9b47785a32ec9d/0_107_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c2c7b8602e4c4210046cebb5172c6d4","title":"birds join chorus of approval as wildlife thrives in a quieter world","story":"Deer roam city streets and hedgehogs can safely cross roads… but a radical policy shift is needed to protect wildlife in future, say campaigners Britain’s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.”Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant Himalayan balsam, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.”The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of goats roaming the streets of Llandudno, and fallow deer in the east London suburbs, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels.The lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers.The big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of “normal”, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts’ Williams points out. “When the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750f927c955ff63a5106dccd42755208a9fcff4d/0_249_5103_3061/master/5103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc99acbc3bb3199783e89d3e0083846b","title":"tales of love and loss people from oceania share their extinction stories aoe","story":"The Living Archive aims to help people worldwide see the significance of species loss as it affects inidual lives and placesThe first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo.Growing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island’s lost birds at school. Children studied pictures and listened to audio recordings of their calls – but by then, the island’s forests were silent.In the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now plans to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild.That day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. “It was very profound, very touching – I talked to it, and started crying,” he says.To Perez, the bird’s fate echoed that of his people: San Diego is home to the largest diaspora of Chamorros outside of Guam. For many years, Perez was one of them. “We migrate to survive and to have better opportunities, but at the same time, we’re far from home, we’re in a new situation, and it can be very traumatic – for the sihek as well as the people.”A poem Perez wrote about the sihek is among those featured on the Living Archive, a new multimedia web platform that provides a space for people from Oceania to tell their “extinction stories”.“When a species goes extinct, so much is lost,” says Perez, who is now an associate professor of English at the University of Hawaii. “Not only from the environment and the ecosystem, but culturally as well. We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.”The site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others – especially the Pacific’s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute – to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year.As the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. “Focusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species.“Multiplying voices and erse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.”In Indonesia’s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people. To the Marind, the plant is of central significance for both subsistence and cosmology, but Papua is the new oil palm frontier, and as plantations spread across the landscape, groves of sago are being destroyed.“Even though the communities I work with are facing all kinds of adverse social impacts from this deforestation, whenever I asked them what the worst impact was, they would invariably tell me that ‘oil palm kills the sago’,” says Sophie Chao, an anthropologist from the University of Sydney who has spent a decade living alongside the Marind.“They would almost place the fate of this tree before their own lives … it was the threat to the sago, this nourishing, life-giving plant, that they considered to be the most dramatic rupture caused by deforestation and oil-palm expansion.”Together with members of the Marind community, Chao co-wrote an extinction story about sago for the Living Archive. It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: “From eating sago, we grew bone from eating sago, we knew home.”Marind call themselves “sago people”, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, “sago and Marind can follow each other’s lives”.People also talk about being “good food for sago”, Chao says. Palm starch nourishes the Marind through their life but when a person dies, they must be buried in a sago grove so that their body becomes food for the microorganisms that in turn feed the forest’s roots.Now, conventional palm oil companies clear-cut the groves, and even “sustainable” projects can exclude local people from conservation zones, severing the Marind’s lifelong connection to their kindred sago.“This plant is culturally meaningful, and it is politically meaningful too,” says Chao.“When people are talking about this kind of localised extinction they are also speaking about what they see as their own possible extinction as West Papuan people: the cultural dilution, forced sterilisation, systemic incarceration, and all sorts of other processes that are very much part of the collective identity of West Papuans.”And yet, the whole point of the Living Archive is to “avoid the politics of despair,” Chao says. As she tells in her extinction story, the Marind themselves have found some hope and resilience in the possibility of reaching a kind of understanding with oil palm: “So we cannot deny ourselves hope when they are finding glimmers amid the rubble!”There is power in good stories, Chao says. “They might not be able to change the status quo or the structural processes and violence that are causing extinctions, but caring matters. Fleshy stories make us care more.”And they’re more important now than ever, van Dooren says. Covid19 is seen by many as a product of a dysfunctional relationship between humans and animals, and the broader environment too.“Extinction is only part of that puzzle but it’s a significant part - it’s a symptom of a broader set of problematic relationships that we’re being reminded of, not just by Covid 19, but by climate change.“Storytelling is a big part of how we manage those relationships and how we imagine other possibilities.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d7962940433fb499bab4ff4445290c11b718c1/0_59_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2162754d22ca411531fc8d1e8fd72db9 2280w","title":"no sweat how tracksuit bottoms became the height of lockdown fashion","story":"Sales of sweatpants soar as fashionistas embrace the joys of an elasticated waistline in their working-from-home outfitsTraditionally, tracksuit bottoms have been the enemy of fashion. Karl Lagerfeld’s withering, oft-quoted maxim – “Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants” – summed up an attitude, certainly in some luxury fashion circles.But lockdown has brought change. Last week, Anna Wintour, Vogue editor in chief, stunned many fashionistas by posting a photo of her work-from-home outfit: a Breton top and joggers. For context, during an otherwise breezy online Q+A session held last July, the air turned decidedly frosty when a fan piped up with: “Hey Anna! Do you wear sweatpants?” Wintour replied with a stern: “No!” followed by a dramatic pause. One Twitter user wrote: “This could be the end of the world as we know it. Anna Wintour is seen in sweatpants for the first time ever.”Maybe not the end of the world, but certainly possibly the end of an era. Joining Wintour is model Bella Hadid, who wore a white pair on TikTok, and influencer Courtney Trop (342,000 followers) sported a pair from the Miaou label.The pandemic has softened towards the tracksuit bottom elevating it to the work-from-home trouser of choice. “Most people just want an easy, quick choice in these times. They have become the new jeans-and-nice-top,” explains fashion stylist Bianca Nicole.But not everyone is convinced. Last week, Adam Tschorn, deputy fashion editor of the LA Times , wrote an impassioned plea against the rise of the tracksuit bottom in our work-from-home environment. “Please, can we put away those sweatpants, ratty, grey, decades-old collegiate sweatshirts and obscure minor league baseball caps, and start our workdays looking like we deserve the pay we’re lucky enough to be earning while the world around us burns?”Perhaps he was recalling the last time sweatpants were popular – in the early 2000s, with the rise of brands like Juicy Couture, and celebrities such as Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Amy Poehler (as the naff “cool mom” in Mean Girls) and Paris Hilton (she infamously said she owned 100 pairs), wearing them as loungewear.The popularity of the jogging bottom has prompted questions about our post-coronavirus workwear: will we be trading our pencil skirts and chinos for something with an elasticated waist? “I was wondering that myself,” says Sofia Prantera, the designer behind label Aries Arise, whose No Problemo tie-dyed tracksuits have become a cult favourite. “I think there are two outcomes: ‘I never want to see sweatpants ever again’ or ‘how will I ever be comfortable in fixed-waist trousers?’ Hopefully for us the latter.” Rees says: “We’ve moved a long way (forward) with office attire. There’s absolutely a place for them in the workplace.”But, cautions David Telfer head of design at Sunspel, “it is about what you feel socially comfortable going to work in”.Are joggers indicative of a bigger change? A hitherto previously unexplored era where all areas of our lives are inextricably mixed? Kim Toffoletti, associate professor of sociology at Deakin University in Australia, thinks so. “Their popularity at the moment might precipitate a move away from more formal attire, an emphasis on looking ‘professional’ at work, and more flexibility between boundaries of living and working,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2510a3b81021af7503489aec64829e68e153261/0_258_7739_4647/master/7739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491049c41227567596c64f8d58816ccd","title":"four quick and easy recipes for adults and children alike","story":"From ‘macaroon’ porridge to ‘magic’ pizza, four nifty and nutritious dishes for kids that will delight their grown-ups, tooSift the flour into a mixing bowl, ideally one with a pouring lip.

But not all is lost in these days of lockdown. Old routines are transforming into new ones, and many of them, I am happy to say, revolve around food. Mealtimes have been regaining their past glory as our main way to punctuate the day, or week. In my house, lunches are now makeshift picnics, Saturday mornings are official pancake time, Tuesday afternoons are dedicated to baking, and on Sundays we’ve reclaimed the old lunch tradition. If you are able to sit down for Sunday lunch, with family, housemates or Zoom pals, it can really provide that bit of comfort that is so needed right now.If you can’t get bone-in chicken legs, use a whole chicken, jointed, instead.

I like to eat both the cake and custard at room temperature, but you could warm either element, or both, if you prefer. The plum jam can be easily swapped with another jam, and if you don’t have hazelnuts, blanched almonds would also work well.For the cake and praline140g blanched hazelnuts4 eggs80g caster sugar30g plain flour1 tsp baking powder½ tsp lemon zest2 tbsp double cream2 tbsp maple syrupFor the custard300ml double cream50ml whole milk2 tsp lemon zest2 egg yolks½ tsp vanilla bean paste, or vanilla extract60ml maple syrupHeat the oven to 170C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.

Since Darby retired from football after his diagnosis with motor neurone disease in 2018, the former Liverpool, Bradford and Bolton player has united with the British Forces veteran Chris Rimmer, a close friend who also has the disease, to launch the Darby Rimmer MND Foundation to raise awareness and fund research into the condition.Running the marathon for the foundation was a “no brainer” for Carney, but it was her mum who gave the push she needed to take on the challenge. “I did the half marathon in October last year just to keep me ticking over when I retired and to give me something to focus on,” Carney says. “I crossed the finish line and my mum said to me: ‘Well done, but you know what you’ve got to do now, you’ve got to do the marathon and you’ve got to do it for Steph and Stephen.’”Carney had been talking in the BT Sport studio with Stephen Warnock, a friend of Darby, about a way they could do their bit, and her mum’s words provided the answer. So Carney and Warnock signed up to run together.“Obviously I know Steph well, and I know her husband through seeing him after games,” Carney says. “I just wanted to show my support for Steph. I have seen how it has affected her and she’s been amazing this whole time. And more importantly I want to help him as well because this is a disease which has no cure I think life expectancy is between one and five years. It’s devastating illness and I don’t think people know enough about it.”Coronavirus may have delayed the marathon, but Carney will be doing toe taps with a football on Sunday instead as part of the 2.6 Challenge which is raising money for Save the UK’s Charities by asking people to come up with an activity to take part in on what would have been the 40th edition of the London Marathon - for example, by running or walking 2.6 miles, or for 26 minutes, juggling for 2.6 minutes, or bringing together 26 people on a video call.Carney has relaxed the intensity of her marathon preparations but it has provided her with some important support during lockdown. “I’m just kind of doing half marathon stuff and once we’re hopefully out of lockdown I’ll start to build my training up again. I think it’s really important to keep running for mental health in this lockdown and it’s really helped me – it’s given me structure.”The strength shown by Houghton, Darby and Rimmer has also helped her drive through the ups and downs of training.“I’ve known Steph for years and years. I wouldn’t say like we’re besties or anything like that, but I think the world of her. The one word sums up Steph is ‘class’. How she conducts herself, she’s always positive, never moans, she’s a captain for her football club, captain for our country, her performances continue to be outstanding, her performances at the World Cup were first class. She’s an absolute role model to everyone, including myself.“I have struggled at times when I’ve been training for this marathon. It’s been challenging trying to run 20 miles and juggle personal and professional life as well. It’s difficult but when the times get hard on those runs I think of Steph, Stephen and Chris and the a bigger picture. To help them and their families is a big honour for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4acbb24007630ed8272658fa30dd12fed626ef9/313_256_4357_2616/master/4357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d13b9bc1568b881219957f0ea8f5c7","title":"blind date kayleigh josh","story":"Kayleigh, 28, marketing manager, and Josh, 28, senior account executive, meet onlineWhat were you hoping for?The One or a good anecdote.First impressions?He’s in a tuxedo and I’ve just about managed to brush my hair.What did you talk about?Cricket, bad chat-up lines, the fact that my friend encouraged me to do this because I’m apparently single and desperate, the accents we do when we get drunk and lie about our identities (me: scouse, him: South African).

Revive your house with colours that will bring cheer and relaxationIt’s hard, stuck inside for weeks on end, not to notice how much your four walls could do with some paint – if, like me, you haven’t had them done for a while. To be honest, it’s been troubling me for ages – lockdown has just made it worse. As long ago as February I’d wandered into a Farrow \u0026amp Ball shop wanting advice for my daughter’s small bedroom. It was still decorated for a young child, but she’s 16 now and she yearned for something more grown-up – a calming escape where she could study and relax with friends. And I spied on a Farrow \u0026amp Ball noticeboard an advertisement for their colour consultancy service.Colour curator Joa Studholme has worked at Farrow \u0026amp Ball for 24 years, inventing colours that have become legendary among decorators, including the charming Nancy’s Blushes, named after her daughter’s pink cheeks.She started advising on decorating after her children were born, having previously worked in advertising. This unlocked a real passion for colour. “When I was a child, I was obsessed with colour,” she says. “My father bought me a box of Caran d’Ache crayons and it was literally my pride and joy. I would spend hours rearranging them in the tin. At 12, I painted my ceiling yellow because I wanted it to be sunny, and I painted the inside of my cupboard in stripes.”What would she recommend for us? Our house is a typical London Victorian terrace. It’s painted in various shades of elegant off-white that my husband says have always bored him. As she enters our porch – pre-lockdown – she exclaims: “Oh, this is crying out for colour!”She sets off for a wander through the house, notebook in hand. At the end, she lines up colour swatches on large pieces of card representing a harmonious journey through the house: muted whites, grey-blues, pinks and greens, yellow and black. For my daughter’s room, she chooses a wonderful dusky pink that she devised and named Peignoir – feminine but not sugary – which she promises will turn to grey in the afternoon light. “It has a big dose of black in it,” she explains.Joa adds an accent of a darker pink (Sulking Room Pink) behind the bookshelves. “I love adding bits of hidden colour, where you’re not expecting it. It’s the equivalent of a bright green lining in a sober black suit.”Painting a house from top to bottom is expensive. So we pick out a few key rooms to focus on. An easy start is the front door and porch. She recommends creating a space quite distinct from the open living room that comes after by painting the front door (inside and out) and inside the porch in a blueish grey called Pigeon. For the small downstairs loo, currently a pale blue that feels cold in winter, she selects a deep muddy pink (Dead Salmon).Our next project is the office in the converted loft, where my husband says he’d like yellow. Fine, says Joa. Being at the top of the house, the office is a kind of final destination rather than a part of the journey through the house, and needn’t conform so closely to the overall colour mix. She prescribes a cheerful shade called Hay for the walls and ceiling, with a few accents of dark brown on woodwork. He looks delighted.The most dramatic elements are the staircase spindles (currently white), which she’d like to see painted deepest black (Railings). This, she says, will give a structure rising all the way up the house.“Your house is a treasure chest of opportunity,” says Joa. “I am not in the game of changing things for the sake of it. I want to create something you’ll be comfortable with, to reflect your personality, but with a bit more character. To make you smile!”But the colour should make its presence felt differently in each space. For our bedroom, she suggests a soft mix of blues and greens (Cromarty and Grey Blue), “so you barely notice the colours and your shoulders relax as soon as you step into the room.”The aim in these troubled times, says Joa, is to create a sense of wellbeing, as though your house is giving you a hug. “There has been a seismic shift in the way we are using colour in the home,” she says. “The huge popularity of the neutral home is on the wane. When the world is in turmoil, what better way to comfort ourselves than embracing stronger colours that have an air of nostalgia and nourish not only our homes but also our souls?”I ask if she has ever made mistakes with colour. “I did once make a big mistake with the children’s bathroom. I wanted to make it look like a 1950s caravan. I used Churlish Green, which has yellow in it. When the children got in the bath, they looked so ill! I had to change it quickly.” She painted it pink instead, “which made them look very bonny”. Now our Pigeon-coloured porch is bonny, too.1. There are three basic ways of decorating: a) using colour on the wall and a complementary white on the woodwork b) using the lightest colour on the walls and a darker tone on the woodwork and c) use one colour on both walls and woodwork.2. If you have an entrance hall or porch, then consider painting it a dark colour. You will create some drama on entrance and everything after it will feel lighter.3. Think about the light and how and when you use different rooms. Large, light rooms used during the day usually work best in a light colour, while darker, smaller rooms painted in strong tones create inviting spaces for you to retire to at the end of the day.4. If you are wary of colour, start by using stronger tones in smaller places, like the back of a bookcase or even inside a cupboard.5. Strong colours are much easier to live with when they are used below the eyeline. More dramatic colours used on kitchen islands and the underside of baths is a classic way to ground a room and add a little bit of excitement.6. If you have a low ceiling, paint your skirting and your coving the same colour as the walls to maximise the height.A Farrow \u0026amp Ball in-home colour consultation costs from £195 per hour. At the moment, consultations will be offered online. For details, visit (farrow-ball).

Four photographers capture a community near them. Interviews by  Emine SanerSome put out bunting, others brought out a mirrorball, many dressed up. Banner Road’s second street disco, held on a sunny weekend in Bristol, brought people out to dance and chat (all spaced by social distance markers painted on the road) and eventually join in the Macarena together.“I was thinking of a group dance we could do and everyone knows the Macarena,” says Jesse Meadows, one of the organisers, along with her three housemates. An actor, Meadows has lived on the street for six years and has been a driving force behind its community feel. A few years ago, keen to meet more neighbours, she organised a street drink. Last month, she helped set up a support group one neighbour printed flyers, another delivered them, and their WhatsApp group now has more than 70 members who can ask for help with anything from shopping to collecting prescriptions. Meadows currently shops for a woman she has never met, leaving her groceries outside her front door. Neighbours have been sharing seeds one resident left Easter eggs on doorsteps for the children. Before the one-hour street disco, residents from the whole street took part in a clean-up.Nurse Maya Vaitilingam has lived on Banner Road for 21 years, and the Easter weekend disco was a godsend. She is currently unable to work, while she looks after her disabled daughter. “She has not been at school or had any respite for nearly a month now, so for me to feel I have support from the local community is great,” Vaitilingam says. “The ability to get together and have a chat at a distance… everyone is really conscious of protecting the vulnerable.” The street disco has become something for her daughter to look forward to. “She is non-verbal, but she really enjoys music. So for her to be outside and have a bit of a dance is lovely.”Most of the terrace houses on Banner Road have steps leading up to the front door and people have taken to sitting on them and chatting to neighbours passing by. “Hopefully, when this is all over, this sense of community will remain,” Meadows says. “And this time, we can do things in close proximity.”“Our worlds have shrunk and our street has become our world,” says photographer Christian Sinibaldi, who works regularly for the , and shot Pope Francis for Weekend magazine. Last month he started taking portraits of the people who live on his road, having found the idea of lockdown difficult at first he was used to travelling and meeting people for work. But if he couldn’t go anywhere, he could at least turn his attention to what was happening outside his front door.For the past eight years Sinibaldi has lived on Evering Road in Hackney, east London, a long residential street which links the rapidly-gentrifying Clapton at one end and the more affluent Stoke Newington at the other. An attractive, leafy stretch with a mix of Victorian houses, mostly converted, and small blocks of flats, it also has a notorious past: Reggie Kray murdered Jack McVitie here in 1967.So far Sinibaldi has photographed around 35 households, with plans to shoot many more, posting them on Instagram (@everingroad). Before lockdown, he knew four or five people on Evering Road now, he’s met around 100. While there has been a large influx of younger people, he was interested in the residents who were here long before the coffee shops and pop-up art galleries. Joyce has lived on the road for 50 years and is close to her neighbour, Helena. Desmond has lived in the area for 63 years, and told Sinibaldi he is “simply missing the freedom to walk around. We don’t think about freedom, in the same way we don’t think about our feet until we are unable to walk.”Taking these photographs has changed his relationship with his street, Sinibaldi says. It’s one thing to walk down it on the way to somewhere else, “it’s another to ‘observe’ it. I’ve made a lot of new friends, and been promised lots of barbecues and beers when we’re all allowed to meet up in the future. London, generally, is a fairly inidualistic place and everybody minds their own business. Now, when I walk up and down, people say hello all the time.”It was Al Lewis’s turn to lead the Friday-night singalong, and the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love was the song that got sung the loudest. “Because of the sentiment,” he says. “And that was the last one, so everyone had loosened up and their inhibitions had gone.”Organised by Eoghan Walsh, a primary school teacher who has lived on this pretty row of bay-fronted terrace houses for three years, it was Northumberland Street’s third singalong. Walsh is a member of a Facebook group set up for the wider Canton area in west Cardiff, where someone had suggested communal singing as a way to lift the spirits during lockdown. They asked Walsh to take care of it, “because they know I’m not shy. We saw song being used in Italy in the bad times, and I know that this whole thing has really brought us together. People aren’t getting out. But they know that on a Friday at 6.30pm, they’re going to come out and see smiling faces.”The Canton Community Singers Facebook group has since grown, and Walsh hopes other streets will join them. This week, Lewis, a singer-songwriter, chose Valerie by the Zutons, Delilah by Tom Jones, and the Beatles’ classic. “You try and choose songs that everyone will know,” he says. “We had lots of people come out of their front doors, or at their windows. The sound bounces off the houses.” One resident joined him on a kazoo.Adrienne Earls, who runs a charity matching volunteers with different projects, has lived on the street for nine years. Until last month, she knew only her next-door neighbours and a couple of other people now she is part of the street’s WhatsApp group, set up since the lockdown to offer support to anyone who needs it. (There are other street-based initiatives, including one woman who collects weekly donations for the local food bank.)Earls’ two-year-old son has chronic lung issues, which means she and her husband decided to self-isolate early. The WhatsApp group has brought them a joyful sense of community, “and the security of knowing, because we’re both non-drivers, that if anything was to happen to our son, there are lots of people on the street who could help”. Another resident, Lynne Williams, who is in her 70s and self-isolating with her dog Gryff Rhys Bones, hasn’t needed help yet. “But I know that if I was ill, Gryff would get his walk. It’s a security blanket.” She also loves the weekly singalong. “Delilah was a brilliant choice, it’s just so outrageous. It’s a bit of much-needed fun right now.”Friday night, Earls says, “is the highlight of my week. Singing with people connects you – the smile you can see on everyone’s faces. People really look forward to it and the numbers grow every week. We can hear people in other streets singing as well. It just makes you feel a bit more united.”There is bunting strung between the houses of the two men who take it in turns to DJ at the street disco held every Sunday morning on Kingsmead Road in south London. It is already a road with an active community spirit: there have been annual street parties since 2012. Once the country went into lockdown, one resident, Sonia, coordinated the delivery of flyers to every house, offering support to people. Those with gardens have been cutting flowers and leaving them on the doorsteps of neighbours who live in flats. Others have been sharing the bread they’ve baked, or swapping plants. People have been decluttering and recycling things to other households. One man, Parin, who lives in a neighbouring street, has been running a popular curry-cooking club on Google hangouts. And now there is the Sunday-morning disco.“I think there are a lot of good things coming out of what is a very difficult time,” says Rob Cockburn, a lawyer and one of the DJs behind the event. “There’s no reason why we should only have this strength of community in adverse times. We should remind ourselves to keep this going.”People observe social distancing but come out in the street to dance, or just sway by their front gates. “Rob normally puts on a costume,” says Simon Lycett, who runs an event floristry company. “Some of the kids will get their coloured chalks out and scribble on the pavement, and people will jig around in the street.”Clare Timmins, a civil servant, has lived on the street for 15 years. She is a single mother to two children, and a rescue bulldog. She lives with several chronic health conditions and recently spent 10 weeks in hospital, before being discharged into the lockdown, so needs to shield herself. Timmins kept in contact with her neighbours through the street WhatsApp group while she was in hospital. “It was wonderful to know that I was coming back to this street with people who cared for each other,” she says. As we talk, a neighbour comes by to drop off a roast chicken. This week it was the turn of Barny North, who works in digital media and has lived on the street for nine years, to DJ. He says he spent a lot of the week thinking about his playlist. “It’s very eclectic. A bit of pop. Mostly jazz, a bit of RnB, a bit of reggae.” His final track was Nina Simone’s Feeling Good.North’s neighbour Andrea Mulligan says Barny and Rob have mastered the art of DJing for a motley lockdown crowd. “In this time of not being physically close to people, you are enjoying a moment at the same time.

They ended up with 30-40 guests.In true Zoom style many of them were dressed up from the waist up with pyjama bottoms out of shot, and friends sent messages of congratulations.They had a virtual toast, with Fukuda and Storr Brown, 48, who works in finance, on their rooftop. A neighbour, who was also a witness, took photos from a safe distance.Fukuda said it ended up being a unique and intimate experience that was “way better than going to city hall”.But, with so many of her friends having lost jobs in the fashion industry as a result of the outbreak, she added: “It’s just a sad and emotional time. To see everybody on the screen, it’s actually very nice and I feel closer to them.”The couple, who have been together for three and a half years, had planned to have two weddings – one in Tokyo in May and one in upstate New York in June. But following the coronavirus outbreak they, like thousands of others who planned to get married in New York this year, were forced to reassess their plans.They still plan to do in-person weddings in both cities, but will wait until either later this year or next.She said living in lockdown is “a great test for marriage”, adding: “If you can go through this, stuck in an apartment all day with your partner, this is an amazing test … We passed it, I hope.”April and May are usually among the busiest months for weddings in New York. But following the shutdown, marriage bureaus have been closed and marriage licences not issued.The new executive order allows marriage licences to be issued and ceremonies to be carried out using “audio-video technology” providing that a series of conditions are met, including the couple must provide valid ID during the conference, it must be performed live and the couple must be within the state of New York.They then have to send the signed document to the town or city clerk, the witnesses and the officiant on the same date it was signed.As it was announced, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, made reference to the challenge that lockdown presents to some couples, saying: “Marriage rate is going down, orce rate is going up.”He joked: “Video marriage ceremonies, there’s now no excuse when the question comes up for marriage. No excuse. You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no?”Brian Teagle and Jennifer Pettus, both 37, had planned to get married near their home in Westchester, New York, in March but they cancelled their wedding and honeymoon a week beforehand because of coronavirus. They are now considering getting married remotely.The morning of their cancelled ceremony, Teagle, who works in sales for a not-for-profit, said he and Pettus, a marketing director, had “a tear-filled ceremony between us where we gave each other our rings and said vows to each other, so in our minds we’re already married”.While they were excited to hear about the new rules and want to get legally married, they are still trying to decide whether it’s right for them. “We’re going back and forth on it,” Teagle said.Sarah Ritchie, a Manhattan-based officiant for Simply Eloped, has yet to do a legally binding Zoom wedding but has done a symbolic ceremony virtually and found it “much more intimate than I thought it would be”.She said: “We’re going through a pandemic… there are all sorts of good reasons that people intending to get married should be able to get married now. Whether it’s health decisions, health insurance, it’s a really scary time.”She added: “Grabbing life and having a moment of hope and good cheer soothes all of us.”Officiant NYC, a group which performs wedding ceremonies, said that as soon as Cuomo made the announcement they had an influx of inquiries. But they are waiting for clarity from city hall on protocol for signing the document before they go ahead.They hope to be back to performing in-person weddings again in September. But Lucas Calhoun, an officiant at the company, said he expects it to be different from before the outbreak.“I just don’t see it being the same when we go back to it. The days of massive gatherings for these weddings where there’s 200 people, we’re a ways off from that. But intimate weddings, five to six people, I see that happening probably around September.”New York city council said the city clerk’s office is working on launching a system for virtual marriage ceremonies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2353ece8afebf9e65a512bf4f1690962471646a1/651_826_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebf9451c20d2991bd92b593a2637969e","title":"google earth in wool and satin in pictures","story":"Victoria Rose Richards creates “embroidered landscapes” influenced by the Devonshire countryside where she grew up. “I get inspiration from aerial views on Google Earth,” says the 21-year-old artist, who uses wool, French knots and satin stitch to make her “colourful and optimistic” scenes.

I could not have known then how my life would soon be consumed by this story. I have spent the four months since constantly weighing the risks to my family, my colleagues and the people we interviewed against my responsibility as a journalist.Reports about a mysterious strain of pneumonia in Wuhan – a city I had only vague memories of from a reporting trip in 2013 – began cropping up in late December. I relayed to my editor the government’s assurance that there was no sign the virus was being transmitted between humans.Partly, I didn’t think the Chinese authorities would get this wrong after the cover-up and fallout from Sars in 2002-03. But also I wanted to believe them – even as a trained sceptic who has covered China for years. I knew how complicated and difficult life would become if this turned into an epidemic.Within two weeks, officials announced the virus was contagious. Hospitals in Wuhan were rammed with panicked, sick residents, and the city went into lockdown. I struggled with the decision of when to go to Wuhan, or whether or not to stay in China. We knew very little about how the virus was transmitted and how serious it could get.For a few weeks, my mum called every day demanding I come back to the US. She would send message after message, including audio recordings of Taiwanese news shows in case I didn’t have access to the news. My husband, also in the US at the time, was more measured and trusted me to make the right call. My editors said to leave as soon as I felt unsafe. I promised to if things got worse.Over the next few months, I worked in a state of de facto quarantine from my living room in Beijing, in friends’ apartments in Hong Kong and in a hotel in Shanghai with so few guests the staff turned most of the lights off to save electricity. I called people in Wuhan and watched videos of dead bodies in hospitals, health workers breaking down under the strain, residents pleading for help. I scrolled through pages of online posts from people asking for advice after being turned away from hospitals and ignored by overwhelmed government staff. There were several accounts of suicides.Seemingly small, random details about people trying to care for their elderly relatives would bring me to tears. A woman described putting a blanket down in a hospital lobby for her parents, turned away but too sick for the journey home. They slept on the floor and later both died. A young woman studying abroad talked with her sick father until his phone battery ran out as, unable to find transport, he walked several miles home from the hospital. The last time I spoke to her, he was in critical condition.These stories were difficult because I could see myself in them. If my mother were dying and police would not let me through a checkpoint to get her help, I would also rage at them – demanding to know whether or not they were human beings.Then, almost suddenly, the story shifted. The number of daily new infections in China began dropping. After 76 days of people being shut inside their city and their homes, Wuhan would soon begin to let residents leave. I went to witness the end of the lockdown at the start of this month and report on what went wrong in the early days of the outbreak.Wuhan felt strangely calm. People seemed ready to move on, commenting only that things were “much better”. They were no longer angry at authorities for suppressing early warnings of the virus. Seeing other countries struggle, they were appreciative of their own government’s efforts. “Now we know what the word motherland means,” a nurse said while giving me a throat swab to test if I had the virus – a requirement before coming back to Beijing.But there were signs of trauma and resentment below the surface. One woman broke down crying during an interview. Even though the lockdown was lifted, she was scared to go out and she was still angry at whoever had allowed this to happen. Others were filing lawsuits, demanding officials be held accountable.Reporting those stories was also difficult. I was repeatedly told by local contacts that patients, doctors and nurses had been told not to speak to foreign media. “You are Chinese. Don’t have contact with them,” one resident said he had been told by his neighbourhood committee.Still, people spoke to us and I worried about the impact on them. Several said local police had tried to intimidate them for talking to the , and that they had been ordered to cut off communication. When I apologised for causing them trouble, one said: “I’m glad I got to share with you. It’s what we should do.” Another told me repeatedly: “I’m not scared of them.”Recently I was woken up by a phone call from someone I had interviewed in Wuhan. They were frantic. Had I published the story? Could it be deleted? Local authorities had called them in, warning that foreign journalists like me would try to “use” people like them.“I am just a normal person. I don’t want anything to do with politics,” they said, pausing to apologise for calling so early.I groggily tried to explain that we had not used a name, given identifying details or printed any comments that could be construed as opposition to the government. Still, they were worried about their job and family, and confused as to why sharing a personal experience was politically sensitive.That is what has been the hardest, but also most inspiring, thing about covering this outbreak. Not only are people reliving the most painful experiences of their lives when they talk to us, but they are also risking being harassed, or worse, so that the rest of the world can know what really happened in Wuhan. Many of them speak out anyway.

All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU – for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.Coby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.If your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.The fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb60eb89c86a0767b8c3d5e29d72959c309a3f9/0_0_3315_1990/master/3315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d844a34596a25742ac12c2d76a9f73e1","title":"coronavirus refunds fans ticket policies","story":"With thousands of live events axed or rescheduled, many fans are finding it tricky to get money backThe coronavirus shutdown has cut a swathe through the world’s cultural events, with UK casualties ranging from the Glastonbury festival to thousands of gigs and theatre performances.Theatre and music fans whose plans have been dashed are reporting long waits for refunds, with some claiming that companies are trying to fob them off with credit vouchers rather than giving them their money back.With the original dates for some events having passed, ticket firms, promoters and venues have been contacting affected customers – but they often seem to be reluctant to address the “R” word: refund.The UK’s Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) – to which almost all leading ticket companies belong – has made clear that if an event is cancelled customers are entitled to a refund of at least the face value of the ticket. The same is true if an event has been rescheduled and you are unable to attend the new date.Some acts have avoided leaving fans in limbo. On Monday, Bon Jovi axed their 2020 tour, saying that cancelling, rather than postponing, “will enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries”.But many concerts and other events have been rescheduled for later this year or 2021, with existing tickets valid for the new date.Many fans will be happy to stick with their booking. Glastonbury has offered the 135,000 people who had paid a £50 deposit for this year’s event the chance to roll it over, guaranteeing the opportunity to buy a ticket for 2021’s festival. Given the annual scrum to buy tickets, the vast majority will probably do that.But some who bought tickets for an event are now in a much more difficult position financially and want their money back as soon as possible.One of the companies facing criticism is ATG Tickets, part of the Ambassador Theatre Group that operates dozens of venues including many West End theatres hosting shows such as The Lion King, Wicked and Pretty Woman: The Musical.Many ticketholders have complained on social media that they have been waiting weeks for refunds. On Twitter there are scores of unhappy customers, some of whom say they have been sent credit vouchers they do not want.One, with the username Just Jack, claimed: “I’ve now had to ask @ATGTICKETS three times for a refund on my cancelled show from nearly three weeks ago because they’re dodging the issue or offering freebies so they don’t have to give me my money back.”The same day another, Dan Clarke wrote: “I made my refund request several weeks ago but have still had no reply.” AndMeg Potter tweeted: “I’ve been on hold for nearly an hour trying to get a refund for my performance that has been rescheduled for two years’ time! Is there any other way I can get my refund?” ATG is responding to people on Twitter, telling them that if they have emailed in a refund request, this will be processed and they should disregard any vouchers.But you would not know that from the long statement and Q\u0026ampA about Covid-19 on the firm’s website. At the time of writing it does not mention refunds once – it talks about either switching to a future performance or receiving a credit voucher. And calling the company is not easy: on Monday,  Money rang customer services and was put into a queue. We gave up holding after 55 minutes.Asked about customer complaints, an ATG spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry about the delay. At the moment we are dealing with approximately 300,000 inidual bookings, which means we are taking a little longer than we hoped to react to every customer. We have brought in additional teams to respond as quickly as we can.”ATG said it was prioritising ticketholders for performances that had been due to take place up to 2 May, so customers with events beyond that date may not have received an email yet.In the US, Ticketmaster has been at the centre of a row over allegations it changed its terms on refunds after the coronavirus shutdown began. While that relates only to the US, the Covid-19 statement on Ticketmaster’s UK website this week said little about refunds, other than that because of the high number of cancellations and rescheduled events, “we encourage you not to reach out directly with a refund request”.Again, unhappy customers have been tweeting about their experiences, with many saying they are waiting for refunds for cancelled perfomances and that their emails to the company have been ignored. Ticketmaster UK says that for cancelled events customers will automatically receive a refund on to the card they used to buy the tickets – they do not need to do anything. If a show is rescheduled, tickets will remain valid for the new date, though if the booker cannot attend they can ask for a refund.While scores of ticket companies and venues are signed up to Star and abide by its code of practice, there are smaller festivals, local theatre shows and other events where the organiser is not a member and will have its own terms and conditions. In some cases these will be facing a precarious future. Some people have donated the value of their tickets to venues to keep them going.In terms of what is a “reasonable” period within which refunds have to be made, one ticketing expert says normally it would be about 14 days, however, these are extraordinary times.While many events have been cancelled, others are still scheduled to take place but with no guarantee that they will, leaving some ticketholders in a quandary. Some would argue that summer festivals now look less likely to take place after the government’s chief medical officer said on Wednesday that social distancing will be needed until at least the end of the year.At the time of writing, the Latitude festival in Suffolk was still scheduled to take place on 16-19 July, with headliners including Liam Gallagher and the Chemical Brothers. Inevitably, this is causing some concern. On 21 April, one fan, Elisa Schwarz, tweeted “… Latitude festival have mine and a lot of others’ ticket money and have not communicated with anyone if they will cancel and refund, £240 is a lot of money to some of us”.It is a similar story with the Reading festival, whose headliners include Stormzy and Rage Against the Machine. However, this event is scheduled for 28-30 August, so it could still proceed as planned.The websites of both festivals stated that the events would go ahead as planned, although the organisers were monitoring the official guidance from the relevant bodies. The Latitude website added that “there are no refunds, other than for cancellation or significant alteration of the festival”. The Reading website issued a similar warning.There is no guidance on how much notice of cancellation has to be given, though one small consolation is that in most cases, particularly with bigger shows, events are not being axed at the last minute. But for the time being, most ticketholders will have to wait and see.

Hitchin man makes squirrels an NHS-themed assault courseOne man has turned his lockdown boredom to an unusual end by making a “Nutional Health Service” obstacle course for his garden squirrels.Steve Barley, 55, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, used pieces of old wood to make the quirky course, which is suspended from a washing line nine metres from the ground.“If I can show my appreciation for the wonderful work our medical services do, and raise morale with a laugh or two at the same time, then I’ll be a happy squirrel man,” the retired school teacher said.In a pun-filled video, Barley commentates as squirrels Dr Drey, “head of anutomy”, and Dr Dana Scurry, “nutrionist”, make their way across the course, which involves going under a microscope, through an X-ray machine and hopping across a “hopsital” bed.Viral TikTok challenges boost morale in Birkenhead care homeA group of older care home residents are the latest to have a go at the TikTok dances that have gone viral in recent weeks. Stephen Robinson, a care home assistant, enlisted the help of 93-year-old Mary Hurst and 82-year-old Brenda Finch to make a series of videos, which have been viewed thousands of times on the platform.In one video, Robinson and Hurst take part in the “flip the switch” challenge, in which people swap clothes to the sound of Drake’s Nonstop. The clip has already received 20,000 views on TikTok.In another clip, Finch acts out the lyrics to Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5, complete with an early morning glass of wine.“We had a ball of a time making the videos with Stephen, and hope they bring a smile to people’s faces,” said Hurst, who praised the staff at Anchor’s Heyberry House in Birkenhead for their dedication.Robinson said residents enjoyed keeping up to date with the latest social media trends: “I have a very close connection with both Mary and Brenda … When I told to them both about TikTok they were more than willing to jump onboard.”Family distributes hundreds of plants to neighbours with home ‘garden centre’When Craig Sullivan, a keen gardener, realised he had a surplus of plants, he put out a call on the hyperlocal social network Nextdoor to ask if any of his neighbours wanted any – and was inundated with more than 100 responses.He and his 20-year-old daughter, Marcella, set to work growing and distributing, and in just a few weeks they have given 230 plants to more than 100 local people, prioritising those who are vulnerable or self-isolating and families with children.“We’ve become a tiny two-person garden centre,” said Sullivan, 52, an internet consultant who has a large garden in Blackheath, south-east London. “But I sensed this need was about more than plants – it’s about people having something to look after, nurture and care for when all the world is in chaos.”Many are first-time gardeners, or are growing with few resources on balconies, so Sullivan provides growing guides to help people care for their plants. “We’re just going to keep going until we run out of seeds,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

It calls for the government to ensure that councils and teachers stay in touch with those most vulnerable to exploitation, and those suffering the “toxic trio” of domestic violence, substance misuse and mental illness at home. The findings are part of a paper focusing on the deprivation endured by England’s most vulnerable families“While the government’s decision to keep schools open for the most vulnerable children is welcome, sadly most of them are just not showing up,” Longfield said.“They are most likely at home, often exposed to a cocktail of secondary risks – a lack of food in the house, sofa-surfing or cramped living conditions, neglect, or experiencing acute difficulties due to parental domestic violence, substance abuse and mental health problems. Many will be caring for parents or siblings themselves in these incredibly difficult circumstances.”The report said the lockdown has removed many of the usual ways of identifying children at risk, with schools and other community hubs, including doctors’ surgeries, youth centres, children’s centres and libraries also closed.Longfield said she wants to see schools working with local authorities to ensure that all children known to be vulnerable are still being seen by professionals.“I applaud the efforts of some schools and councils to ensure vulnerable children are still being visited by teachers or social workers. I’d like to see this extend throughout the country,” she said.The report and data collected by the children’s commissioner found huge variations among local authorities in different categories of deprivation and vulnerability throughout England.The DfE said local authorities were receiving additional funding of £3.2bn to cope with pressures caused by the coronavirus lockdown, including in children’s social care, and that it had set up teams around the country to improve its information on the risks facing vulnerable children.“Schools and early years settings remain open for vulnerable children, who are encouraged to attend where it is appropriate for them to do so. We thank social workers and everyone involved in keeping these children safe at this time for their hard work, including continuing to conduct risk assessments and home visits where needed,” the DfE said.But Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said the government could not ignore Longfield’s warnings of the heightened risks.“Yesterday, the government significantly relaxed statutory duties on local authorities to protect vulnerable children. In light of this report, it is even more urgent that the government guarantees these changes will not adversely impact children in need and commits to reversing them if there is any evidence they are doing so.“Ministers must also alleviate the financial pressures on families which may be making the situation even worse, including ensuring urgent access to food where the free school meal voucher scheme is failing,” Long-Bailey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04e50b5eff60663098079cf329e6c87c0359706/100_0_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29a298f2aaf901a8bcb16631106f098c","title":"poorer expectant mums lose over 4000 through unfair anomaly in benefits","story":"System treats maternity allowance as unpaid income, skewing the amount of universal credit paid outPregnant women on the lowest incomes are being denied vital financial support during the Covid-19 crisis, according to unions and women’s support groups, who are calling for urgent reforms to universal credit.An anomaly in the way universal credit differentiates between pregnant earners has created an unfair system, it is argued. Universal credit treats maternity allowance, which is paid to the lowest-earning women and those who are self-employed, as “unearned income”, which means it is deducted from their benefit payments.By contrast, statutory maternity pay, paid to higher-earning women by their employers, who claim it back, is treated as “earnings”, and is therefore largely ignored when their benefit payments are calculated.Both forms of payment are supposed to give women financial support at a time when they need to bond with their baby.Maternity Action, a charity that campaigns on behalf of pregnant mothers, says the inequitable system means some women on maternity allowance who apply for universal credit end up more than £4,100 worse off over 39 weeks of their paid maternity leave than women on statutory maternity pay.“We do appreciate that the support schemes have been developed in difficult circumstances,” said Rosalind Bragg, Maternity Action’s director.“However, it would take little effort to resolve the unfair treatment of maternity allowance in universal credit calculations… The financial cost to government would be extremely low, but it would make a massive difference to women and their families.”Last week, an alliance of 14 unions, women’s rights groups, charities and law firms wrote to Dominc Raab, urging him to take action.Their letter claims that “the prime minister’s announcement on 16 March that pregnant women are classed as vulnerable led directly to many pregnant women being sent home on sick leave, in breach of existing health and safety law”.A DWP spokesperson said: “ It is right that a claimant’s award is adjusted to take into account support they are already receiving, including income through benefits.”But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the imbalance was another example of why universal credit needed overhauling. “Britain’s lowest-paid mums are having financial support unfairly deducted at a time when family budgets are already under stress from a new baby,” she said. “Coronavirus has exposed gaping holes in our safety net.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a80b18fbe8136c96f0fdce7e40e73fccc384860/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6928ed1b89fa64332602bec569f7544","title":"jofra archer reveals he has lost his england cricket world cup winners medal","story":"England pace bowler Jofra Archer revealed he has “gone mad” searching for his Cricket World Cup winner’s medal after losing it during a recent house move. Archer rose from relative obscurity to become a household name at last year’s tournament, finishing as England’s leading wicket-taker with 20 at an average of 23.05.Archer was chosen to bowl the super over in the Lord’s final against New Zealand last July, holding his nerve in the most dramatic of situations to spirit England to a remarkable triumph.But when asked about his souvenir from the day, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: “I had it hanging off a portrait someone did for me and sent to me, I had my medal hanging on that. I moved flat and the picture is on the new wall but there’s no medal. I turned the house upside down for about a week but I still haven’t managed to find it.“I know it should be in the house so I will keep eyes out for it but I’ve gone mad looking for it already.”Archer admitted he has spent much of his time during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, having returned to the United Kingdom from Barbados last month, looking for his medal. And the 25-year-old said the search will continue, adding: “There’s nothing else to do in isolation. It’s all hands on deck.”England prevailed in the final on boundary countback alone after they matched New Zealand’s total in the regulation 50 overs while the Kiwis equalled the hosts’ score in a nerve-shredding super over.While Archer would have seemed the logical choice to bowl England’s super over after his supreme success in the preceding weeks, the fast bowler was reluctant to put his hand up because of his status as a newcomer to the team.Asked when he realised he would be tasked with the super over, Archer replied: “Pretty late. I wasn’t sure until I had to go down there and warm up. That doesn’t mean I didn’t want it, I just didn’t think I was in a position to volunteer, I was just coming into the team, I’d played the least amount of games in the squad. I didn’t think it was my time to volunteer.“It was the only super over of the whole tournament, I never actually thought about it or planned for the situation, it just happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ced4413cec234184ddf91a1f5f265c268ede557/307_559_2402_1441/master/2402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07e9e6f006e2641c51348bbde94d80c1","title":"sheikh fahad commits british horse racing after ending france ireland deals","story":"Qatar’s Sheikh Fahad remains fully committed to British racing, his spokesman said on Saturday, following decisions to end sponsorships in France and Ireland. Qipco, an investment vehicle for Qatari royals, will no longer be the title sponsor for the French Derby or the Irish Champion Stakes and other savings will be necessary but the Sheikh will continue to give his backing to Champions Day at Ascot and the series of prestigious Flat races that lead up to it.“This year, seeing the way the world is going, everybody has got to be much more frugal and efficient in the manner in which they spend their money,” said David Redvers, racing manager to Sheikh Fahad, whose claret colours have become familiar to racegoers through the exploits of Roaring Lion and other top-class racers. “What we are absolutely determined to do is to ensure that the money which Qipco puts into racing achieves the maximum effect for the sport. The whole purpose is to widen its appeal, to reach a bigger audience and leave a lasting legacy for Sheikh Fahad and his brothers’ investment. It’s terribly important that we use it wisely and deliver the results.”The sharp-eyed might notice one consequence as TV cameras pan around British tracks later this year, assuming Flat racing becomes possible at some stage. “We won’t be branded up around the nation’s racecourses as we were before,” Redvers said, “because it was an extraordinary and unnecessary expense.”Qipco has already poured huge sums of money into British racing, having been the title sponsor for British Champions Day since its first year, 2011. An extended deal with Ascot, Newmarket and the British Champions Series in 2015 was hailed as the biggest in the sport’s history and it seemed there was no bottom to this particular well.The withdrawal from sponsoring in Ireland and France shows everything has its limits, but Redvers said Qipco would continue to be a huge contributor to prize money in Britain under the Champions Series deal, which runs until 2024.“I’m not sure about the absolute pounds, shillings and pence. What we’re doing is reorganising so that we can maintain everything at a sensible level. Obviously the world economy is taking a massive battering in every direction and Qipco are basically ensuring that we can keep sponsoring at a good level for as long as possible. This isn’t about a reduction, it’s about sustainability. There’s been some fantastic positives to come out of Qipco’s sponsorship, not least that the average age of the racegoers going to Champions Day has been falling, year on year.Sheikh Fahad has also recently decided to sell his Longholes Stud in Newmarket, which is being advertised with a guide price of £6m. Redvers said the Sheikh had bought it with the intention of making a home on the site but he had since bought a home elsewhere in the area. While he is currently in California, Sheikh Fahad apparently intends to return to Britain as soon as travel restrictions allow, partly in the hope of seeing his classy Kameko take part in the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby.“We spent more money on yearlings last year than we had in the previous three,” Redvers added. “Sheikh Fahad bought a good number of very smart yearlings, has hugely exciting horses in training and, like everybody else involved, we’re all just frantic to get the sport back on, albeit behind closed doors, so that we can protect this generation of bloodstock and participants’ livelihoods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1caaa021e3fa61baa11e4db4db5480533d01a9d2/54_0_4511_2708/master/4511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6fc699e19a9182f9919dec38598175","title":"coventry city v tottenham hotspur 1987 fa cup final live","story":"So congratulations to Coventry City, the deserved winners of the 1987 FA Cup! Onwards and upwards for a club that has finally come of age as a top-flight concern. Next season’s kit, a gorgeous sky-blue take on Denmark’s beloved Hummel number from Mexico 86, looks like a statement of intent to us. As for Spurs ... only those with a heart of stone or a Highbury season ticket will fail to feel for them, after contributing so much to the league and both cups, only to come away with nothing. They’ll be back at Wembley soon enough, just like David Pleat promises. Anyway, thanks for reading this MBM. David Lacey’s report has landed click below and enjoy. Here’s hoping for more David-Goliath cup drama next year!Glenn Hoddle, having come off very much second best in his tussle with the relentless Lloyd McGrath, is slightly sour. “It is a lot harder to paint a picture than to destroy one,” he harrumphs. Not sure his manager will be having that, not least because Coventry played some very pretty football indeed. In fact, here’s Pleat again: “A couple of our players did not do what they have been doing or are capable of doing. The players who did not quite get to grips with it know who they are.” You don’t have to squint too hard to read between the lines there. Ah well, Hoddle’s almost certainly off anyway, there’s probably no point worrying too much about his feelings.David Pleat’s hot take: “We were in a lovely position at half-time. A third goal for us would have killed it. The second goal was absolutely vital for them, they were more convinced than ever that their name was on the cup. In the end I thought they deserved to finish in front. We were stretched and they might have scored more. But we contributed to a fair game. We needed to win something at the end of a season in which we have scored a lot of goals and played a lot of games, but it didn’t work out that way. Now we’ll go and try to keep our heads high. Some of our younger players will be back here.”John Sillett finally takes the lid of the cup off his head, stops dancing, and speaks! “The longer the game went on, the more certain I was that we were going to win it. Just before extra time I could see some heads dropping. They didn’t relish the prospect of the extra half-hour. I felt that if we continued to do the simple things and make the ball do the work, then this, plus our character and stamina, would make the cup ours. I said to the players at the end of regular time: let’s get at them. But there should be credit all round here. We saw two sides trying to play attacking football as we both showed the best of the English game.” Preach on, Schnozz.Some clarification regarding Tottenham’s second goal. It was indeed scored by Mabbutt. He’s claimed it, and Kilcline is more than happy to agree. And it’s been made official. That means Mabbutt joins Charlton Athletic’s Bert Turner (1946) and Manchester City’s Tommy Hutchison (1981) as players who have scored at both ends in an FA Cup final. It’s an exclusive club. Does that make things better or worse? It’s hard to say, isn’t it.Brian Kilcline climbs the famous 39 steps to lift Coventry’s first-ever major trophy! He does so in a slightly ginger (yeah, yeah) manner, holding it up below the handles, carefully around the waist. The thigh and ribs must really be hurting. But then one of the photographers shouts “Handles!” in an demand for a more traditional pose. Kilcline, adrenaline acting as an opiate, extends his arms and obliges, hoisting the cup as high as it can go! Meanwhile spare a thought for poor old Spurs: several of their players are laying on the hallowed turf too, but in desolation as opposed to elated exhaustion. David Pleat is wandering around in stunned confusion, while Richard Gough looks close to tears.Coventry cavort as you’d expect them to cavort, albeit in a half-kaput fashion. Keith Houchen, one of 12 heroes, responds to the final whistle by quietly shaking hands with Gary Stevens. Dave Bennett, surely the man of the match, sits sprawled on the turf. Cyrille Regis squats next to him, head down, catching his breath. They’ve put everything into this. Not a joule of energy spared. They deserve this. They have been sensational, every last one of them. And it’s wasn’t just a story of graft and effort either: Coventry have won the cup with great flair and style. They’re a fine team, and now they have their place in history.The ref blows the final whistle and a 104-year wait for a major trophy comes to an end for the club formerly known as Singers FC! John Sillett and George Curtis leap into each other’s arms. David Pleat adjusts his cuffs, a coping mechanism of despair. It’s a sorry end to a Homeric season for Spurs. But what joy for Coventry, who finally have something to put in the cupboard! And not only that, they’ve played their part in one of the greatest FA Cup finals of all time. Perhaps the very best! An instant classic.ET 30 min +1: Hoddle hooks a hail-mary cross in from the left. It’s nowhere near a team-mate and the ball bounces harmlessly through to Ogrizovic. On the bench, Sillett clenches both fists with a COME ON!!! Curtis performs the universally understood mime for Get Up The Blooming Pitch, Will You. Then Sillett stands up and acts it out as well. Coventry are so close! So close! Sillett sits back down, but four seconds later he springs back up again, because ...ET 30 min: A Cov cacophony of whistles. Spurs are reduced to knocking it long. No good comes of the tactic. Regis, Bennett and Gynn play a bit of keep ball in midfield. A cheeky Bennett backheel - shades of Leeds versus Southampton in 1972 - elicits cheers of olé! from the Coventry faithful.ET 29 min: Stevens and Paul Allen combine down the right, sending the latter into acres of space. Allen whips a head-height cross through the box. Neither Hodge nor Claesen can get anything on it. Hodge was an eyebrow away.ET 28 min: Wonderful keeping by Clemence, mind. Meanwhile Sillett and Curtis continue to have a ball on the Coventry bench. Have any managers ever enjoyed FA Cup final day like these two? Their enthusiasm has been infectious from the first whistle.ET 27 min: Coventry Should Have Wrapped This Up! (pt. XXXVIII in an ongoing series) Bennett intercepts a dismal Mabbutt pass and pings it straight back down the inside-right channel, releasing Gynn! Stevens tries to get back, but fails, sliding in from behind and missing. Gynn only has to dink over Clemence to wrap it up, but tries to round him on the outside instead. Pushed too far wide right, he slaps a tame shot straight into the sprawling keeper’s midriff. That really should have been that! ET 26 min: Waddle drops deep to quarterback, but sends an aimless ball straight down Ogrizovic’s throat. Spurs are running out of ideas. Actually, in truth, their well of inspiration ran dry quite a while ago.ET 25 min: Hoddle dinks a cute first-time wedge down the inside left for Claesen, who enters the box with a view to taking delivery of the pass, then shooting. But Peake is over to bravely head clear as Claesen attempts to trap. An intervention timed nearly as well as his whistle solo on Cov’s 45rpm pop platter.ET 24 min: Stevens crosses from the right. Clive Allen traps, his back to goal on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He spins. If he curls one towards the bottom left, Ogrizovic’s feet are planted and Spurs are surely level. But McGrath pressures him, and Allen is only able to dribble a lame effort towards the bottom right and into the keeper’s hands.ET 23 min: Incidentally, there’s a similar story unfolding at Hampden in the Scottish Cup final, where it’s bad news for Po’ Simon McMahon. Hot favourites Dundee United have fallen behind. Ian Ferguson has broken the deadlock for unfancied St Mirren! Shocks both sides of the border are on!ET 22 min: Downs has a batter. It’s straight at Stevens, who was suspiciously closer than ten yards. Coventry recycle possession, and Gynn sashays in from the left, before fizzing a shot inches wide of the left-hand post. Not sure Clemence would have got to one planted in the bottom corner.ET 21 min: Rodger strides up the middle, once again channelling his inner Bobby Moore. He nearly releases Houchen on the right, but the pass is blocked. Bennett picks up possession and dribbles at the raggedy Spurs back line. Mabbutt comes crunching in to concede a free kick, just to the right of the D.ET 20 min: Before Spurs take their corner, Houchen is given a good talking-to by the referee. He’s obviously been running his mouth off, and Neil Midgley points theatrically to the tunnel, making it quite clear that one more word and he’ll be joining Manchester United’s Kevin Moran on the surprisingly short FA Cup final roll of shame. Zip it! Hoddle’s corner is punched clear with great authority by Ogrizovic. Bennett wanders off upfield, the clock his and Coventry’s friend.ET 19 min: But Spurs aren’t done quite yet. Hoddle lumps a pass down the right for Paul Allen to chase. It’s overhit, but the midfielder does well to reach the byline before the ball goes out, and clanks it against Downs for a corner. “If Coventry pull this off, next week is going to be absolute hell,” worries 12-year-old James Wrout. “I desperately need some validation in the harsh world of the first year of big school. I’m really tempted to just stay at home all week instead.”ET 17 min: A slow start to the final period of this extra time. Spurs need to up their game if we’re to come back later this week for a replay. And we’re off again! Coventry get the ball rolling for the second period of extra time. They’ve were the best side in the first period by some distance. Spurs look knackered, their long season catching up with them at the very end. Can they somehow gather themselves for one last haul? “It’s extra time at Hampden too,” reports Simon McMahon. “Still no goals, though Dundee United have had one (rather dubiously) chalked off for offside. Can’t they check these things on video these days? I’m starting to think this might not be our day, or week.” Or month or even year? If it all goes the shape of a pear, we’ll be there for you, Simon.The Sky Blues are 15 minutes away from glory. Tottenham have 15 minutes to salvage their 100 percent record in FA Cup finals.ET 15 min: From the resulting throw, Waddle crosses and Rodger heads away from danger. Spurs come again, Hoddle attempting to magic-wand a chipped pass down the inside right for Waddle, but it flies harmlessly out of play for a goal kick.ET 14 min: Bennett teases Thomas down the right for the umpteenth time. He finds Phillips on the overlap again. Phillips lays off to Houchen, who dribbles towards the corner flag before abruptly turning and flicking a pass back inside for Bennett, on the edge of the area. And this is a sheer delight: a first-time flick through the legs of Thomas. For a brief moment, this could be another cup-final goal for the ages! But just as Bennett prepares to shoot and deliver the killer blow, Gough slides in to block bravely. Spurs break through Paul Allen, but Rodger ushers the ball out of play down the right.ET 13 min: Bennett drives at the Tottenham back line. He sends a pass wide right for Phillips, who has time to cause trouble, but balloons a cross behind for a goal kick. Over on the Spurs bench, David Pleat waves an encouraging fist at his players. Come on lads. But he’s currently perched at the polar opposite of the enjoyment spectrum to Sillett and Curtis. A season that promised so much looks like ending in abject trophy-free disappointment. Spurs certainly don’t look like a team capable of turning this around. Plenty of time left yet to prove us wrong, of course.ET 12 min: This is all Coventry. Spurs look out for the count. On the bench, John Sillett and George Curtis are a textbook study of elation. Clapping their hands, waving their arms, smiling and laughing, Coventry’s managerial duo are clearly determined to enjoy their big day, just as their players look in the mood to seize it! Fun: it’s a simple concept, unfashionable perhaps. But they’re having it! Wonderful to see.ET 11 min: Bennett takes up possession down the right as Thomas and Gough faff around in the exhausted, nervous and incompetent style. He feeds Houchen , who is afforded way too much time and space just inside the area. Houchen tries to thread one into the bottom left, but it’s gathered by Clemence and always curling away in any case. Coventry are racking up the chances to put this one beyond doubt. Will they live to regret their generosity?ET 10 min: But it’s still a free kick just to the right of the D. A quick tap to the right, and Phillips bangs a dismal effort straight into the wall. A chance to warm Clemence’s hands - or possibly put this final out of Tottenham’s reach - is spurned.ET 9 min: Nope! Downs and Houchen combine down the left and suddenly Bennett is racing into the Spurs half, with Gynn free in acres down the middle. Bennett delays the pass a little, and though he finds Gynn, he’s allowed Gough to get back and cover. Still, all Gough can do is cynically check Gynn as the Coventry livewire prepares to turn on the jets and zip past him down the inside-right channel and into the box. A tired and desperate hanging out of the leg, with no attempt to play the ball. He should go in the book, but we know what sort of mood Neil Midgley is in, so it’s just a chat and a finger-wag. Both sides have got away with one.ET 8 min: Claesen immediately busies himself down the right and earns a free kick off Downs. Hoddle’s delivery isn’t all that, and it’s cleared by Rodger. Hoddle gets another go, but his right-wing cross is hooked clear by Peake. Will this turn into attack versus defence, as Coventry City, 104 years young and without any major silverware to their name, sail nervously into uncharted territory?ET 7 min: Spurs respond by sacrificing Hughton for the Belgian striker Claesen.The substitute Rodger intercepts a long pass intended for Clive Allen and strides upfield in homage to Bobby Moore. He calmly enters the Spurs half, takes a look around, and sprays a pinpoint pass to McGrath on the right touchline. Thomas is nowhere near him. McGrath makes it all the way to the edge of the Spurs box, level with the six-yard line. He looks for Pickering in the middle, but Mabbutt, desperately tracking back, sticks out his left leg in the hope of blocking and bundling out for a corner. He had to attempt the interception, but it doesn’t work out. The ball slices off his left kneecap and sails along a perplexing parabola, looping over the helpless Clemence and into the top left! What an absurd stroke of bad luck for Mabbutt and Tottenham ... though Coventry were playing delightfully, pushing hard and this is their reward! ET 6 min: Spurs wobble a little. Phillips attempts a cross from the right. It’s blocked. He has another go. In the centre, Gough heads weakly straight up into the air. Regis beats Hughton to the second ball, dropping on the penalty spot, and guides a header left for Pickering. The bounce isn’t Pickering’s friend, and he’s forced a little wide, where he has to hook across goal. Bennett, on the far post, tries to head down for Houchen, but Hodge does enough to put the striker off and Thomas skelps clear. But Coventry come straight back at Spurs, and ...ET 5 min: Hodge drifts in from the left, a run that momentarily threatens to open up the backpedalling Coventry defence. But just as it appears the space for a shot is opening up, Downs arrives on the scene to block. ET 4 min: Mabbutt exchanges passes with Stevens and tries to burst through the middle of the Cov defence but the door slams shut. Coventry break through Pickering, McGrath and Bennett, the latter skating down the right and winning a corner off Hodge. The set piece is taken short, and Bennett dribbles along the byline before ballooning an excitable cross high over everyone in the box. Another promising position comes to nought.ET 3 min: Bennett rides a weak Stevens tackle in midfield and sets off upfield. He finds Gynn, who has options: Pickering to his left, McGrath and Houchen to his right, and there’s only Gough and Mabbutt guarding the back gate for Spurs. Gynn’s eventual pass left, intended for Pickering, hits Gough on the heel and a fine break crumbles.ET 2 min: A slow start to extra time. Coventry fans amuse themselves with a rendition of their cup final song, Go For It City. Sky Blues, shooting to win! Not a peep of Hot Shot Tottenham yet. “My dad has gone to Wembley today to watch the cup final with my uncle – without taking me,” cries Jonny Weeks. The tears are fair enough, because he’s only four years old. “My mum’s not even put the game on the tele ffs! This MBM’s all I’ve got. Got a funny feeling our name’s on the cup today. I don’t care how we do it – via someone arse or knee in extra time for all I care. I swear we’ll name a fanzine after whoever wins it for us. Play Up Sky Blues!” That’s pretty darn erudite for a pre-schooler! What an extremely smart young lad. He’ll go places when he grows up, I’ll be bound.And we’re off again! Again! Spurs get extra time underway. They’ve made a change, with the cramp-bound Ardiles replaced by Stevens. “As a Cov fan, my nerves are shredded already,” begins Malcolm. “Not sure I can take extra time. My Spurs mate feels the same. He says he doesn’t care how they win, he’d take another scrappy goal off Mabbutt’s leg.” Extra time follows after the break ... during which Germany beat England 12-0 in an advert for Holsten Pils. (They deserve a little shout-out, given the Spurs shirt fiasco.)This has been a superb final, an instant classic ... and we’re going to get more of it! Another 30 minutes! Thank you, o football gods! And if nothing gets decided during extra time, to a replay we will go. 90 min +2: Some time has been added for the stoppage after the Kilcline-Mabbutt incident. Only now do both teams look like they’ve settled for extra time.90 min: Bennett wanders up the right wing and is brought down by a knackered Hodge. From the resulting free kick, Bennett is found in plenty of space down the right, but with time running out he panics and snatches at his cross, sending it high and wide.89 min: Kilcline, who has been limping since bodychecking Mabbutt, can’t continue. He’s jiggered his thigh, and maybe his ribs too. Coventry’s captain is forced to make way for Graham Rodger. He departs to a disapproving chorus from the Spurs choir. Rodger is immediately in the thick of it, winning a clearing header from the corner.88 min: Waddle twists and turns, 25 yards out, desperate to shoot. But Gynn won’t give an inch. Coventry hold their shape. But then the ball’s slipped wide for Hughton, who curls low towards the near post. Clive Allen is sniffing, nips in ahead of Phillips on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, swivels and flips a shot on target from the tight angle. Ogrizovic, at his near post, contorts at great speed to kick off the line and out for a corner. Allen so close to goal number 50 for the season, and what surely would have been the winner! That split second will have seemed like minutes for everyone involved with Coventry City, their once-in-a-lifetime dreams very nearly extinguished at the death!87 min: Waddle takes the resulting free kick. Kilcline heads it powerfully back upfield. Regis bursts down the middle on the counter, feeding Gynn on the left. Gynn twinkles his toes, but can’t get past Ardiles and soon enough Spurs are on the counter-counter! Thomas and Clive Allen combine crisply down the inside left, the former nearly breaking into a world of space just in front of the Coventry area. But Downs and Pickering swarm and bundle the ball back to Ogrizovic. There’s never been a sign of anyone settling for extra time.86 min: Kilcline really should be booked for that, but referee Neil Midgley - who to be fair has refereed this free-flowing game marvellously, and without pomp or ego either - settles for a stern chat. The Spurs support don’t like it, but what can you do, and it’s in keeping with the mood of the day.85 min: Mabbutt romps down the inside-left channel at full pelt and flicks inside for Clive Allen. As he does so, Kilcline cynically steps into his road. Chas ‘n’ Dave have a song about that. Wallop! He’s gone down! A huge bone-juddering clatter. Actually, Mabbutt’s back up quickly, while Kilcline’s come off the worst. Only fair, all considered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5945dacf95d15742eb426a87eef4be4272cf1e11/0_174_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2307775358942d4bc16b3fa91cf19142","title":"best noise cancelling headphones working from home coronavirus lockdown","story":"Owning a decent headset can really help if you need some peace during the coronavirus lockdownCoping with lockdown life is hard enough without having to listen to other members of your household while you are trying to work.If you can’t get away physically, a set of noise-cancelling headphones could be just the ticket to isolate you just enough to concentrate.

You get a choice of a solid Bluetooth 4.1 connection, with support for AAC and aptX Bluetooth audio standards, or an included 3.5mm audio cable. They sound better with noise cancelling turned on with bright and punchy audio – better than you would expect for £50 – that’s a little over accentuated in the treble.Verdict: A cheap and cheerful bargain.RRP: £220 – deals from £170Want noise cancelling without the bulk of headphones or a cable? Sony’s WF-1000XM3 are the best sounding, most effective noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds you can get.They feature impressive noise-cancelling technology that rivals the best full-size headphones. They sound fantastic, have steady Bluetooth connection with support for AAC, and solid touch-panel controls on each earbud that now include volume adjustment.The earbuds last up to six hours of continuous playback with noise cancelling active, with more than three full charges in the case for a total of 22 hours, all in making them some of the longest-lasting true wireless earbuds available.Built-in support for Google Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri is the icing on the cake.All that technology makes the earbuds massive – but get the fit right and they’re worth it. They even undercut rivals on price too.Verdict: Amazingly effective noise cancelling without the bulk or wires.Bose pioneered the first noise-cancelling headsets in 1986 and has been a market leader ever since for good reason: its products offer excellent active noise cancellation.Now in their second iteration, launched in 2017, the QC35 II combine excellent noise suppression with good sound, simple operation, reliable connectivity and supreme comfort.Though they do not support the latest audio standards, they still have SBC and AAC and a stable connection. You can connect to two devices at once, such as your phone for calls and your computer for work, and the headphones last for up to 20 hours between charges. You can use a headphones cable too when the battery runs out. Good playback and volume controls, plus a button for adjusting noise cancelling or a voice assistant round out a simple, understated design.They are built to last, fold neatly for travel and sound pretty good too. The best bit is their unparalleled comfort: light and airy with good adjustments – ideal for long work days.Verdict: Effective, comfortable and built for the road.If price is no object and you want the very best sound in a set of noise-cancelling headphones that will work wireless, wired and even over USB-C, with practically every option ticked including top-tier comfort, you want the B\u0026ampW PX7 from the upmarket British manufacturer Bowers \u0026amp Wilkins.The big, cushioned ear cups and padded headband provide all-day comfort.

Here’s how to protect yourself and colleaguesBusinesses are used to being prepared for a disaster and most will have had a well-rehearsed continuity plan in place in case one struck. But even the best plan couldn’t have effectively anticipated the wholesale overnight shift to home working that Covid-19 has caused.“As a result,” Morgan Wright, chief security adviser at cybersecurity firm SentinelOne says, “issues of privacy, collaboration, access and compliance have highlighted weakness in policies and gaps in security.” One of the problems is that even at many larger companies, being caught on the hop by the lockdown has meant that inidual departments have been left to find their own ways to work collaboratively.The very act of working from home introduces cybersecurity gaps. Remove that person in the next cubicle or at the desk opposite and you remove part of the human-error buffer. Human nature is such that we are more likely to ask that person for reassurance if we aren’t sure about a configuration option than risk looking stupid by calling tech support or even emailing a departmental manager. This has played into the “zoombombing” problems that have plagued Zoom as millions of users new not only to the app itself but videoconferencing itself have rushed to connect.“Videoconferencing systems often come with default settings which are open in nature and vulnerable to being compromised,” says Mark Rodseth, technical director at digital transformation agency Somo. Default settings such as passwords are not being enabled. Although Zoom rectified this on 4 April and added a waiting-room feature so that you can only join a meeting when the host lets you in, it’s a setting that needs to be checked no matter what collaboration app you are using.Ensure that you are using a different strong password for each application, as password reuse enables attackers to walk into several accounts if just one gets compromised elsewhere. Use a password manager. Not only will this enable you to set different passwords for every app, but their built-in password generator functions will ensure it’s a strong one.Adam Palmer, at cyber exposure specialist Tenable, has some more configuration advice for your videoconferencing tool of choice. “When creating virtual meeting rooms, do not make them public,” he says. “When configuring a meeting, opt to create a randomly generated ID rather than checking the personal meeting ID option and set meetings to private.” Palmer also suggests disabling any “join before host” option to prevent potential trouble before a host arrives. “Additional precautions include disabling the option to allow removed participants to rejoin and share files,” Palmer adds.Do not overlook the privacy and security implications of what’s on view when you’re making a video call.File sharing is another problem area. Many videoconferencing tools, along with collaborative messaging apps, are vulnerable to the threat of malicious links and attached documents sent by someone masquerading as a work colleague or customer. These attacks will be highly targeted “spear phishing” ones, unlike the spam email variety. But the safeguarding rules you would apply to email still apply to your work-from-home collaboration apps, says Oz Alashe, chief executive of cybersecurity awareness company CybSafe. “Ask yourself if you were expecting the message, ask yourself if the message conveys an undue sense of urgency, check the sender details.”. Of course, it’s not just incoming links and file sharing that’s an issue - outgoing ones can be just as problematic.Mark Rodbert, boss of identity analytics company Idax, says his biggest concern right now is with data-sharing tools such as Dropbox and Google Drive. “There has been a sudden and unprecedented need for people to share data over, above and around the ways they have in the past,” he warns, “and that’s where you lose control.” To regain control, you need to follow a few relatively simple guidelines. As we are talking specifically about collaboration here, you’ll be giving other users editing rights to your Google Drive document. That’s a problem, as they can then share it on as well, something you’ll need to prevent. To do this, click on “share” and select “advanced”. From here, you can opt to “prevent editors from changing access and adding new people”.You’ll need to do this for the files inside a folder rather than the folder itself, by the way. You should also choose who you are sharing the data with, which may sound obvious, but if you use the “shareable link” option, your document will be available to anyone with that link, including people without Google accounts and hackers. Far better to be more specific by using the “people” share option where you specify the email address of those who can get access. To make this easier for larger teams, if you don’t have access to workgroups through a corporate G Suite account, you can create a “collaborative inbox” Google Group and specify access to that instead. Add everyone who needs access to the document with different groups for different projects it makes collaborative sharing easy enough. Be sure to set group visibility to members only, though, and make joining any group invite only.As far as any app is concerned, enabling two-step authentication should be a priority. That way, even if a hacker gets access to your login credentials, there’s an extra layer of protection stopping them from accessing files. Use the mobile app option for code delivery, though – it’s safer than using SMS text delivery. Authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator and Authy are free and easy to set up. Two-step options are found by clicking your username, then settingssecurity. From here, you can check to see which web browsers and devices are signed in or connected to your account. Unlink any devices you don’t recognise or haven’t used for a while, and if you don’t recognise a web session, you can simply delete it to boot them off (and then change your password to be on the safe side). Both Google and Dropbox offer security audits, or check-ups, that will guide you through all these processes and are well worth spending a few minutes on.Do not overlook the privacy and security implications of what’s on view when you’re making a video call. Many people will forget they have sticky notes with login credentials stuck on a noticeboard behind them - don’t do that. “A useful feature we recommend using for any video meetings with external parties in Microsoft Teams is the ‘blur my background’ feature,” says Bruce Penson, managing director of Pro Drive IT, “which protects against this happening.” Zoom users can also apply a virtual background."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

I lie prone, elbows in, chest raised and push off the balls of my feet, jumping into a wobbly high crouch. It’s not the most graceful move, but coach Rachel shouts encouragement at my efforts.I’m on a “retreat” with Soul \u0026amp Surf, which runs yoga and surfing holidays in Portugal, India and Sri Lanka, but this weekend we’re not in an exotic location by the sea. I’m trying out its new Soul \u0026amp Surf Pause – a two-day “virtual holiday” with the action taking place in my living room via Zoom.“We wanted to recreate the elements of a retreat with us – and stay connected while we can’t travel,” said co-founder Ed Templeton. “There’s the yoga and surfing, but that sense of community too.”The timetable is a mix of live classes and pre-recorded material, and we join an introductory chat to meet the team and other guests in lockdown around the world. There are three hour-long Zoom yoga classes in different styles, from dynamic vinyasa to grounding yin, designed to counter our more sedentary lives and aid relaxation. We spend a pleasant hour learning shiatsu self-massage with Becca, finding acupressure points to strengthen lungs and release stress.There are playlists to boost the holiday vibe, suggested menus with short video cookery demonstrations (my Sri Lankan dal tastes great despite missing a few ingredients) and recorded breath work, meditation and yoga nidra (sleep) classes to dip into. A surf and music film (Self Discovery for Social Survival, on Amazon Prime) is suggested for an ocean boost – and to analyse for surfing techniques.As someone self-isolating alone, I love having days planned and punctuated with regular check-ins with other people. On Saturday evening we meet Sam Bleakley, pro-surfer and filmmaker (we’ve been sent a link to his Brilliant Corners: Kerala), and talk about the growing surf culture in India. We also hear from marine activist Natalie Fox about eXXpedition, an all-female sailing trip to collect data on ocean microplastics.The Sunday evening sundowners come around all too quickly.

The WHO has reported a fivefold increase in cyber-attacks on both itself and on the public.While some of the activity has been criminal, or linked to “dark PR” firms who work with governments and the far right, other attempts to sow discord have been laid at the door of governments – including disruptive messaging to US mobile phones that has been blamed by US officials on China.In that incident, according to the New York Times, millions of mobile phone and social media accounts were bombarded with fake messages in March, including one saying the Trump administration was about to deploy troops to enforce a lockdown.While Russia and China have been the focus of scrutiny for some of the attacks, others have originated in the US and mirror misinformation and untruths propagated by Donald Trump and some of his most prominent supporters in the US media.The EU report examined material published in nine languages and found that even fact checkers were being fooled by false or highly misleading content that was reaching millions of people on social media.EU officials cited the fact that a third of UK citizens believe that vodka can be used as hand sanitiser as an example of the effectiveness of the disinformation. Conspiracy theories about 5G telecommunication masts facilitating the spread of Covid-19 were also being boosted by actors seeking to promote false narratives, the report said.“In the period covered by this report, it was confirmed that pro-Kremlin sources and Russian state media continue running a coordinated campaign with the twofold aim of undermining the EU and its crisis response, and to sow confusion about the origins and health implications of Covid-19coronavirus”, the report said.The WHO and its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been among the main targets for digital attacks since the outbreak began.The attacks have included racial abuse and the publication of cartoons of Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist and diplomat, as a dog on a lead being held by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Earlier this month, Tedros said he had been subjected to racism and death threats and said many of the attacks had originated in Taiwan, which has complained of being excluded from critical WHO deliberations.Tedros noted that Taiwan’s foreign ministry had not disassociated itself from the attacks, an observation Taipei rejected as “slander”. The attacks appear to have gathered momentum since Trump began blaming the WHO for the slow US response to the pandemic.First Draft, a nonprofit coalition investigating internet disinformation, carried out an analysis of 15,000 tweets in the week beginning 14 April which used the hashtags #tedrosresign and #tedrosliedpeopledied.Deibert cautioned that such campaigns have been seen before, even in the pre-internet era, around for instance well-documented attempts by Russia to spread disinformation blaming the US for Aids. But a combination of global connectivity and anxiety has amplified the intensity of the disinformation war over Covid-19.“This is a global event that touches everyone directly,” Deibert said. “The heightened level of anxiety means citizens are dependent on getting access to health information, often working at home. That anxiety means people are more likely click on something malicious.“We’ve been tracking it closely and you can see several different strands connected in various ways. There are different aims and different technologies. But what you can say is they all work in a communications ecosystem which, by design, has created an environment almost irresistible to malicious actors trying to manipulate, confuse and spread disinformation. Everyone is trying to further their strategic aims.”Paul Barrett, a New York University expert in disinformation and fake news, has identified similar trends and said that some malicious actors are feeding off each other’s disinformation for their own ends.“It’s a three-ring circus of disinformation,” he said. “It is almost impossible to pick out one strain and isolate it, because simultaneously Russian and China and Trump are getting in on the act and imitating each other more and more. It is incredibly difficult for an ordinary citizen to navigate what’s true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359bcba86dc36d52dc7fb6a825faa8a5a6f6d7be/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b490593fa245804daf88a0fd3d4ab5d8","title":"revealed dominic cummings on secret scientific advisory group for covid 19","story":"Exclusive: Leaked list reveals presence of Johnson adviser and Vote Leave ally on supposedly independent bodyThe prime minister’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the .It reveals that both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address.Multiple attendees of Sage told the  that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice.There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret.Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party’s general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.The government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was “shocked” to discover there were political advisers on Sage. “If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,” he said. “That is just so critically important.”Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: “Oh my goodness. Isn’t this maybe why they don’t want us to know who was there?”King said political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of Sage when he chaired them and argued that Cummings, who is not a scientist, could report his own interpretation of Sage advice back to the prime minister.Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington, a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: “I’m not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May’s time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.”In a statement provided by Downing Street, a government spokesperson said: “Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.”Late on Friday, Downing Street released a second statement. “It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘on’ or members of Sage. Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall,” a No 10 spokesman said.“Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this,” the spokesperson added. “Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.”Downing Street declined to say how many Sage meetings Cummings and Warner attended, or whether any other political advisers took part.Sage participants told the  the Downing Street advisers were not merely observing the advisory meetings, but actively participating in discussions about the formation of advice.In a letter to parliament this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, who chairs Sage, said the “decision not to disclose” membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.“This contributes towards safeguarding inidual members’ personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,” Vallance wrote. “Of course, we do not stop iniduals from revealing that they have attended Sage.”On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, appeared to signal a change in direction, saying the public had a right to know who sat on Sage. He told a Commons science select committee that while it was important to consider security concerns, there was “absolutely no barrier” from him or Vallance. Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, Whitty replied: “Yes.”Several members on Sage, as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees, are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government’s response to Covid-19.Since the outbreak, ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice, while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains.Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions, and the UK’s approach has raised eyebrows overseas.The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in “a virtual black box”. “Its list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.” understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January, then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February, and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week.It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings, they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner, they were not allowed to ask questions, having to instead submit them in writing in advance.While core members of the committee, such as Whitty, attend all meetings, other clinical experts, scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting, but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office’s emergency Cobra meetings.Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision–making, was also present, along with fellow infectious disease specialists, Graham Medley and John Edmunds.Others attendees included Brooke Rogers, a professor of behavioural science at King’s College – who also chairs the Cabinet Office’s National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group – and James Rubin, also at King’s, who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science.However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government’s scientific advisory process is free from political interference.A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner, whose brother, Marc, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company that the  revealed is involved in an “unprecedented” data-mining operation as part of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.An accomplished data scientist, Ben Warner previously worked at his brother’s AI company, which has teamed up with Palantir, the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

Ashworth, however, said this claim should be substantiated with evidence and that questions remain over key government decisions.He suggested the UK was slow to go into lockdown and queried why large events such as the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid football game and the Cheltenham festival – attended by more than 250,000 people over four days from 10 March – had been allowed to go ahead.Throughout the outbreak, ministers have reiterated that their policies have been guided by scientific advice, but the process has been shrouded in secrecy and the extent of political influence remains unclear.In a statement, Ashworth said Cummings was “not a medical or scientific expert” and the government must make clear he can no longer participate or attend, “if the public are to have confidence in the Sage”.The government’s former chief scientific adviser David King said party political advisers never attended Sage meetings during his tenure from 2000 to 2007 and that it was wrong for them to now do so.If a political adviser is sitting on Sage “it’s a fair assumption that they are at least in part playing this role, one which it’s simply inappropriate and wrong for them to be playing”, he tweeted.Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS England medical director, said he was confident that Sage had been a forum for scientific discussion among experts.“It is the experts from a variety of backgrounds who discuss the evidence, they discuss the evidence base of the various topics, they come to conclusions around that evidence base,” he told the Today programme.“It is then, of course, the role of Sage to advise the government. I have been confident that what happens at Sage is a scientific discussion involving the scientists and the experts who are members of Sage.”The former head of the civil service, Bob Kerslake, however, said there was a risk “the government is leading the science when it’s supposed to be the other way round”.The former Brexit secretary David Davis called on the government to publish a list of Sage’s members and for any non-scientists to be removed. He said advice should be made public alongside any dissenting opinions as expressed during meetings.“We do this for the monetary policy committee, how is it not right to do so for the much more important scientific advisory committee?” he tweeted. It understood the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to take part in Sage meetings as observers. Unlike Cummings, they were not allowed to ask questions, having instead to submit them in writing in advance.The editor of the Lancet said Cummings’ attendance of Sage meetings would call into question the independent scientific advice that it is mandated to provide.“If it is true that Dominic Cummings attended meetings of Sage, then the government led by Boris Johnson has utterly corrupted independent scientific advice,” Richard Horton tweeted.“But I’m afraid to say that the scientists who sit on Sage have allowed themselves to be corrupted”, including the chief scientific officer and chief medical officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 25 april afternoon","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 199,874 people are confirmed to have died worldwide, while at least 2.84 million are known to have been infected.The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.Britain has become the fifth country in the world to reach the grim milestone of exceeding 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths.Government figures released on Saturday showed that a further 813 people died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the country’s total to 20,319. These figures do not include the thousands of more deaths known to have taken place in care homes.It comes almost six weeks after the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be “a good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get”.The South African government has ordered citizens to wear face masks from 1 May when coronavirus lockdown restrictions will begin to be eased.“It is going to be mandatory to use a cloth mask as you step out of your home,” the traditional affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told a press conference in Pretoria. She added that people could use a scarf or T-shirt if they do not have a mask. South Africa has been on lockdown since 27 March.Far-right groups in the UK, US and EU are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support, Jamie Doward reports. A report by the Zinc Network, a communications agency that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right movements to “utilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances”.Dozens of doctors and nurses in Pakistan have launched a hunger strike over a lack of protective masks and other equipment for treating patients with Covid-19. More than 150 doctors in Pakistan have tested positive for coronavirus and several have died, according to the Young Doctors Association in Punjab, the country’s worst-hit province.Salman Haseeb, head of the Punjab’s Grand Health Alliance, said about 30 doctors and nurses in Punjab were on hunger strike. “We do not intend on stopping until the government listens to our demands. They have been consistently refusing to adhere to our demands,” Haseeb told AFP.The World Health Organization has warned that deaths from malaria could double this year as a result of the disruption caused by Covid-19. The UN’s global health agency said that if countries failed to maintain delivery of insecticide-treated nets and access to antimalarial medicines, up to 769,000 people could die of malaria this year.

TV Asahi said 57 crew members tested positive in the latest round.The infection cluster onboard the vessel docked in Nagasaki comes as hospitals are running out of beds in some parts of Japan, where the national tally of virus cases has risen above 12,800 with 345 deaths. Of those infected onboard the Costa Atlantica, only one crew member had been admitted to hospital, NHK said, while others remained on board having shown slight or no symptoms.Thailand has reported 53 new coronavirus cases and the death of a 48-year-old Thai man who was infected with the virus along with four other family members. Of the new cases, three were linked to previous cases, one had no known links, and 42 were migrant workers who have been under quarantine at an immigration detention centre in the southern province of Songkhla.Seven other new cases were reported from the southern province of Yala, where authorities are aggressively testing the population because of high infection rates there, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government’s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. Since the outbreak escalated in January, Thailand has reported a total of 2,907 cases and 51 deaths, while 2,547 patients are reported to have recovered.China reported 12 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with six the previous day, National Health Commission data showed on Saturday. Of the new cases, 11 were imported, compared with two cases reported previously, the data said. The commission reported 29 new asymptomatic cases, slightly down from the previous day’s tally of 34. Four of these cases were imported. The total number of confirmed cases in China is now 82,816. The death toll remained the same at 4,632, with no new deaths reported on 24 April.Meanwhile Reuters has reported that China sought to block a European Union report alleging Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak.The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations.Diplomatic sources told Reuters that the report had initially been slated for release on 21 April but was delayed after a senior Chinese official contacted European officials in Beijing the same day to tell them that, “if the report is as described and it is released today it will be very bad for cooperation”. The correspondence quoted a senior Chinese foreign ministry official, Yang Xiaoguang, as saying that publishing the report would make Beijing “very angry” and accused European officials of trying to please “someone else” – which the EU diplomats understood as meaning Washington.The four sources said the report had been delayed as a result, and a comparison of the internal version of the report obtained by Reuters and the final version published late Friday showed several differences. For example, on the first page of the internal report shared with EU governments on 20 April, the EU’s foreign policy arm said: “China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image. Both overt and covert tactics have been observed.” The public summary posted on Friday to the EU’s disinformation portal, euvsdisinfo.eu, attributed the disinformation to “state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and to a lesser extent China”. The public summary did note “significant evidence of covert Chinese operations on social media” but the reference was left to the final six paragraphs of the document.In other coronavirus developments:With Reuters and Associated Press"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are there in my area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Drive-through tests in Scotland remain available, and the Welsh government is developing its own portal and has asked that the central booking system does not take bookings for the country’s testing sites.A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said more test booking slots or home-testing kits would be made available from Sunday morning at 8am.A total of 46,000 people tried to book a coronavirus test on Friday, but all 5,000 home tests had been allocated within two minutes of the website going live at 6am. Within three hours of the site launching, all applications had closed.More than 15,000 appointments for tests at drive-through centres also ran out before midday forcing the DHSC to apologise on Twitter.Asked how many tests were available on Saturday, NHS England’s medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, told BBC Breakfast: “We are going at capacity, over 50,000 now. The aim is to get to 100,000 by Thursday.“The NHS has committed to capacity of 25,000 within NHS laboratories and we are on trajectory for that capacity to be in place.”Dr Simon Eccles, the chief clinical information officer at NHS Digital, tweeted: “Home kits all booked by 8:15! I know it’s frustrating but we’re developing more lab, supply and logistics capacity every day.“If we’d waited until we had the full 100k, to launch, no one would have had a test today. More home kits again tomorrow, even more next week.”Under the expansion of testing, NHS and social care staff, police officers, teachers, social workers, undertakers, journalists and those who work in supermarkets and food production are now among those eligible.However, even those who manage to book a test have said they were turned away after arriving at drive-through centres.Key worker Natalie Orton-Rose, from Leicester, said she had been self-isolating after being told by her doctor that it was likely she had coronavirus and booked a test on Friday morning.“I am absolutely disgusted. It is bad enough that my closest test centre is an hour away but then to waste my time and fuel … I think the government and public need to be aware that just because you have an appointment and turn up doesn’t mean you’ll get the very much needed test.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f5e6aa67340398d40838436fe49fff5a13738b/66_114_2719_1632/master/2719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db38d05acefb043791f82e752e649e09","title":"kim jong un china sends doctors to advise on health report","story":"Speculation continues about dictator’s condition after reports of heart surgery and absence from important events China has sent a team to North Korea including medical experts to check on Kim Jong-un, according to three people familiar with the situation.The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean ruler. It was not immediately clear what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Kim’s health.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist party’s international liaison department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people told Reuters.The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea. The sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.The liaison department could not be reached for comment late on Friday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on 12 April. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the liaison department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.On Thursday the US president, Donald Trump, also played down earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill. “I think the report was incorrect,” Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.On Friday a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kim’s current condition or any Chinese involvement.An official familiar with US intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim’s health on Fox News after Trump spoke, said: “I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we’re watching the situation very keenly.”North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters was not able to independently confirm any details on Kim’s whereabouts or condition.North Korea’s state media last reported on Kim’s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on 11 April. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April, an important anniversary in North Korea.Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014 he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.In 2019 Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, which depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea’s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard hit by UN sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong-il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018. Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f401c8698f4fd5798d9b6b1f99491441dc148e/0_39_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c342c3efcff34a15a4ba5744d71a6ca","title":"ourselves scientist says human intrusion nature pandemic aoe","story":"Leading US biologist Thomas Lovejoy says to stop future outbreaks we need more respect for natural worldThe vast illegal wildlife trade and humanity’s excessive intrusion into nature is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading US scientist who says “this is not nature’s revenge, we did it to ourselves”.Scientists are discovering two to four new viruses are created every year as a result of human infringement on the natural world, and any one of those could turn into a pandemic, according to Thomas Lovejoy, who coined the term “biological ersity” in 1980 and is often referred to as the godfather of bioersity.“This pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa… It’s pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,” said Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University.His comments were made to mark the release of a report by the Center for American Progress arguing that the US should step up efforts to combat the wildlife trade to help confront pandemics.Wet markets are traditional markets selling live animals (farmed and wild) as well as fresh fruit, vegetables and fish, often in unhygienic conditions. They are found all over Africa and Asia, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of people. The wet market in Wuhan believed to be the source of Covid-19 contained a number of wild animals, including foxes, rats, squirrels, wolf pups and salamanders.He told the : “The name of the game is reducing certain amounts of activity so the probability of that kind of leap becomes small enough that it’s inconsequential. The big difficulty is that if you just shut them down – which in many ways would be the ideal thing – they will be topped up with black markets, and that’s even harder to deal with because it’s clandestine.”The pandemic will cost the global economy $1tn this year, according to the World Economic Forum, with vulnerable communities impacted the most, and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. “This is not nature’s revenge, we did it to ourselves. The solution is to have a much more respectful approach to nature, which includes dealing with climate change and all the rest,” Lovejoy said.His comments echo those of a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B earlier this month that suggested the underlying cause of the present pandemic was likely to be increased human contact with wildlife.Experts are ided about how to regulate the vast trade in animals, with many concerned the poorest are most at risk from a crackdown. Urgent action on the wildlife trade is clearly needed, said Dr Amy Dickman, a conservation biologist from the University of Oxford, but she was “alarmed” by calls for indiscriminate bans on the wildlife trade.She is one of more than 250 signatories of an open letter to the World Health Organization and United Nations Environment Programme saying any transition must contribute to – and not detract from – the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people, many of whom depend on wild resources for survival. Other signatories include representatives from the African Wildlife Foundation, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).The letter reads: “Covid-19 is inflicting unprecedented social and economic costs on countries and communities, with the poor and vulnerable hardest hit. The virus’s suspected links with a Chinese ‘wet market’ has led to calls to ban wet markets and restrict or end the trade, medicinal use and consumption of wildlife. However, indiscriminate bans and restrictions risk being inequitable and ineffective.”Scientists and NGOs are concerned that over-simplistic and indiscriminate restrictions will exacerbate poverty and inequality, resulting in an increase in criminality. This could accelerate the exploitation and extinction of species in the wild, authors of the letter warn. “People often seem more willing to point the finger at markets far away, as bans there will not affect their everyday lives – although they will often affect the rights of extremely vulnerable people,” said Dickman.There are also concerns about the impacts of an outright ban on a number of indigenous populations, such as tribes in Orinoquia and Amazonia, with representatives describing it as an “attack” on their livelihoods.Mama Mouamfon, who is based in Cameroon and directs an NGO called Fondation Camerounaise de la Terre Vivante (FCTV), said banning the trade would damage livelihoods: “Bush meat is very important for people in the forest because it’s one of the best ways to get animal protein.

This was carried out as part of a “totally private screening operation” allegedly organised by the president of Les Parcs Association, Jean-Louis Oger, a wealthy French pharmacist who has several clinics and laboratories in the south of France.Less fortunate neighbours reacted with anger. “Testing reserved for residents of Les Parcs and their friends under the noses of Tropéziens … a great example of solidarity,” one told Var-Matin.At the Saint-Tropez hospital, medical staff told the paper they were scandalised. “It’s not right that we don’t have a single test and it’s a nightmare to get hold of one,” a nurse said.Saint-Tropez’s mayor, Jean-Pierre Tuveri, attempted to defuse the row. He defended the tests, claiming the wealthy residents were willing participants in a clinical blood trial and accused social networks and the press of distorting the facts.In a statement published on the town hall website, he said the blood tests had been carried out on people “in a private domain and unpaid” as a sample to be analysed by certain, unnamed “laboratories”. And he insisted the operation was carried out “under the aegis of the Pasteur Institute” to whom the results would be sent.The test could not be used by local hospital staff because it had not been approved by the health authorities, he added.However, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a national centre for developing and authorising tests, said it knew nothing about those carried out at Les Parcs.“This is a trial carried out by a private laboratory. The laboratory is doing its own thing in its own corner. We’re not advocating wildcat studies they need to be evaluated with the results of baseline tests,” it told French journalists.“He quotes us and links us to this when we were not at all aware of it,” the institute added.The regional health authority, ARS Paca, also said they had not heard of or approved the Les Parcs Covid-19 testing.“We don’t know anything about it and we’re going to conduct an investigation to get to the bottom of it,” an ARS spokesperson said.Sébastien Debeaumont, director of ARS Paca, confirmed this, adding that any Covid-19 centre had to be meet very specific regulation. “We knew nothing about this local initiative, having not been informed in advance, he said.The starting price for a basic 400 sqm house with a 5,000 sqm garden but no sea view in Le Parcs, first built in the 1950s, is around €5m, a price that doubles for sea view. Properties, some of which have tennis courts on the roof and swimming pools that cover to become terraces, rent for €200,000 a week, according to Capital magazine. Six heliports are authorised in the grounds as long as there are no more than two take-offs a day. Capital magazine reported that some residents are happy to pay €1,000 a month for 100 Mbits a second internet connections.France has more than 119,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 according to government figures. There have been 21,340 deaths reported in hospitals and care homes from the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/452caa5874262d791522851953b1fb74ddf5575a/0_116_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2bb5234a29d4f1cac3224c2078a54c","title":"uk arms trade repressive regimes","story":"Campaigners condemn government and defence exporters accused of selling weapons to states with poor human rights recordsUK arms sales to repressive regimes increased by £1bn last year compared with 2018.An analysis of  figures for arms sales, just released by the government, reveals that in 2019 the UK sold £1.3bn worth of weapons to 26 of the 48 countries that are classed as “not free” by Freedom House, the US government-funded pro-democracy institution. This was compared with just £310m in 2018.Business is brisk among those countries which the Foreign Office itself identifies as having poor human rights records.In 2018, the UK sold £173m worth of arms to states on the Foreign Office list of “human rights priority countries” – nations identified as having human rights issues.Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: “The UK government is always telling us how robust its arms export controls supposedly are, but these figures make clear that nothing could be further from the truth. The UK arms industry is dominated by human rights abusers, despots and dictatorships.“The figures may be good for the arms dealers, but these weapons could be used in atrocities and abuses for years to come.”Most of the growth came from the Middle East: 2019 was a lucrative year in terms of licences to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and UAE.The increase could have been significantly larger. A court ruling freezing arms sales to Saudi Arabia had a considerable impact on UK exports to the kingdom in the second half of last year.And the figures do not include open licences which allow the export of an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years.In 2018, the Observer revealed that, for the previous five years, the UK had been selling missiles and bombs to the Saudis under the open licence system.“These sales are only possible because of the complicity of the UK government, which has consistently put arms company profits ahead of human rights,” Smith said.“UK-made fighter jets and bombs are doing terrible damage in Yemen. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and depleted the healthcare system in a time of crisis.”A government spokesman said: “The UK assesses all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis in line with our strict licensing criteria.“We will not issue export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria, including where we assess there is a clear risk that equipment might be used for internal repression.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178230111c666c660257621fdd6047abc2966b15/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61744c56c68678defeaa68788ce8f492","title":"coronavirus uk calls for transparency over scientific advice to ministers latest updates","story":"Grim milestone comes almost six weeks after chief scientific adviser said keeping toll under that number would be ‘a good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get’As ever, thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions. That’s it for today from us on the UK side, but you can continue to follow the ’s coverage of the pandemic over on the global live blog.As UK universities face huge losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts have warned they need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to shift their degrees online.Only around 20 universities are in a position to provide a good range of high-quality online courses by the new academic year in September, according to Prof Sir Tim O’Shea, the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University. Some of the country’s top-ranked Russell Group institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge, were not in that category, he added.The warning comes as the sector seeks to attract and retain students already deterred from starting or continuing degrees next year, with physical distancing likely to mean lecture theatres and campus bars are closed.Most universities would face costs of at least £10m to create five or six new online degrees in different faculties, said O’Shea, a leading expert on computer-based learning. This would total well over £1bn across the sector.Durham University this week retracted controversial plans to deliver online-only degrees after protests by students and lecturers. Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor of Manchester University said it was preparing to expand its online courses to offset a predicted £270m loss next year.Q. Parents are trying to juggle childcare with work as schools are closed and the economy has to keep running, do you sympathise with them?Priti Patel says these are very difficult and unusual times. She pays tribute to schools, especially teachers and headteachers, staying open for children of key workers.The five tests will have to be met before schools can reopen, she adds. The tests, previously laid out by Dominic Raab and Gavin Williamson, are: to protect the NHS’s ability to cope with coronavirus cases, to see a consistent fall in the daily death rate, to produce reliable data on infection and death rates, to be confident that testing and PPE are being managed properly, and to not risk a second peak of infections.Q. There was much debate about the timing of entering the lockdown. What was the point of delaying it if it’s going to go on and on?Patel says this isn’t a binary choice. We can’t just remove restrictions and move back to how things were, she says. She says she cannot give a date for when it will end and when schools and businesses can reopen. That would be irresponsible and get hopes up, she says.Prof Stephen Powis says the timing was a really difficult decision, particularly regarding economic harm as a result of a lockdown.And that’s the end of today’s press conference.Q. The Royal College of Surgeons says the backlog of cancelled operations could take five years to clear – is that the timescale you’re working on and how many lives do you estimate these delays will cost?Priti Patel says decisions about prioritisation of treatments will be based on resources and capacity in the NHS.Prof Stephen Powis adds that elective surgery had to be stepped down in order to cope in the surge in patients with coronavirus. As soon as we can, we want to step that back up again, he says.Q. When Dominic Cummings attended Sage, did he ever say anything and if so, what?Prof Stephen Powis says he has been participating since towards the end of February. His experience of Sage is that it has been about scientists and science, with experts from a variety of disciplines. It is a scientific discussion between scientific advisers in his experience, he says. The contributions and advice goes from the scientific experts in that group to the government.He does not comment on Cummings.Q. Regarding the rise in motor vehicle use, is the government sending out mixed messages by telling people to stay at home while also allowing non-essential work to take place?Prit Patel says that if you can’t work from home, you can go to work as long as physical distancing is practised.She says she understands it is frustrating being at home for five weeks, but physical distancing will continue to be vital in the future.Q. Why can’t households be extended to a small group rather than just people living under the same roof?Prof Stephen Powis says the virus can spread from household to household, so the purpose of the lockdown was to disrupt that chain of transmission.I think we’d all be disappointed if we forfeited those gains by allowing chains of transmission to start to be re-established, because then we would start going backwards.Q. When do you expect the peak to come in care homes? Prof Stephen Powis says that all along they have tried to resist predicting when the peak will come. With care homes, Public Health England is assisting when outbreaks occur and the government is increasing testing.Q. Doctors and nurses coming into the country have to pay a surcharge for themselves and their families – isn’t it time to scrap it?Priti Patel says a range of measures are under review.They are taking questions from the media now.Q. You said weeks ago the UK will have done well if the death rate stayed below 20,000. We have passed that number now – does this mean the strategy should have been different?Prof Stephen Powis says every death is tragic and his heart goes out to their loved ones.This is a once-in-a-century global crisis, he says, and there were bound to be challenges. Even countries who got on top of it early on are starting to see new infections. This will continue to be something we work through in the months ahead – a sprint not a marathon, he adds.Moving past this milestone shows it is still absolutely critical to follow physical distancing guidelines, he says, because we are seeing benefits and this will only continue if we keep doing that.Priti Patel adds that we are not out of the woods yet, despite the fact we’re making progress. This is a deeply tragic and moving moment.Q. Are you able to envisage relaxing any of the lockdown measures now?Patel says it isn’t optional that the five tests have to be met, so the science can judge when we can revise the measures.It is not now, she says. We need people to continue.Prof Stephen Powis says the number of new cases diagnosed by testing is reasonably stable. With the number of tests expanding, we can expect to see a rise in new cases, but it is fairly stable for now.There is a sustained reduction in the number of people being treated in hospitals, particularly in London and beginning in other parts of the country, he says.He says the number of patients in critical care is starting to decline, although that will lag behind the overall number of admissions to hospitals.A new line for Northern Ireland has been introduced, showing new data that is not currently comparable with the other data as it is cumulative rather than daily, he adds.The number of deaths is showing a trend towards a decline, which will occur later than the trend in hospital admissions and critical care.If we continue to adhere to physical distancing we will begin to see a decline in deaths, he says.Powis says transport use continues to fall across public transport and roads. There is concern that motor vehicle use is starting to rise again.Data from Apple Maps shows a decrease since lockdown in requests for walking, driving or public transport directions.He says it’s tempting to go out in warm, sunny weather, but he can’t emphasise enough that we are not through this yet and it’s critical people continue to comply with physical distancing measures.It would be foolish and not right if we lost the benefits we’ve gained over the last four weeks, which have been hard for everybody.The NHS has not been overwhelmed and has capacity to cope, he says.He reminds people the NHS is still available for treatment of conditions that are not related to coronavirus, including sick children, pregnant women, and those who fear they may be suffering from stroke or heart conditions.Call 111, contact your GP or dial 999 in a real emergency, he reminds everyone.Fast diagnosis and treatment is absolutely crucial, he says, so do not delay. The NHS is still there for you."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237498.1587752699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"junior cycle exams in september set to be replaced with school assessments in may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior sources say an official Department of Education announcement is due  advising schools to conduct their own Junior Cycle assessments in line with school policiesJunior cycle written exams planned for thousands of students in September look set to be abandoned in favour of school-based assessments in May.The move follows concerns that delaying the exams would lead to unnecessary anxiety among students and logistical problems for schools.Senior sources say an official Department of Education announcement is due next week advising schools to conduct their own junior cycle assessments in line with school policies.It is likely to include guidance to schools on options for assessing students instead of a traditional written exam.Schools will likely be given the freedom to decide on how best to arrange assessments for inidual subjects in line with their own policies, according to sources.Schools in which all students have access to digital devices may opt for a more traditional test, but other schools may opt for project work that students can complete in their own time.The tests will not be State-certified or marked by the State Examinations Commission. Instead these remaining assessment components will be graded by students’ teachers and feed into a school-issued Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA), which is given to all students.This JCPA captures student achievements in a number of assessment elements undertaken over the three years of the junior cycle. Instead of traditional grades, students are recorded as having either “achieved” or “not achieved” an area of learning.Academic yearThe decision represents a major roll-back from Minister for Education Joe McHugh’s announcement earlier this month that junior cycle school-based tests would delayed until the new academic year.On Monday a secondary school in Co Galway – Coláiste Bhaile Chláir – announced that it would set its own junior cycle tests for students in May instead of waiting for exams in September.It was followed by Presentation Secondary School in Kilkenny, which also announced on Wednesday that it was going ahead with its own exams for its junior cycle students.Principal Shane Hallahan said the school was taking the move to avoid students being placed under “extreme pressure” over the summer.“The current circumstances are difficult and stressful for students, especially being separated from their peers as they try to prepare. I think we have to be conscious that so many young people have worked so hard for this,” he said.This prompted an appeal by Mr McHugh for schools to hold off cancelling junior cycle tests due next September until discussions took place with representatives of students, parents and schools.Official guidanceThis group met on Friday, and is due to meet again before official guidance is issued next week.In a statement following the meeting, the department confirmed that issues concerning junior cycle assessment were discussed and would continue when the group meets next week.In a statement, Mr McHugh said: “I welcome the progress made in several areas today, including issues concerning the junior cycle final examinations. As I stated earlier this week, I would urge schools not to make any local decisions concerning assessment at junior cycle level until the advisory group has concluded its discussions on that part of its work.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231405.1587117157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"have howth s red squirrels succumbed to invasive greys","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding.Where viruses came from, in all their erse billions in a teaspoonful of sea, a forkful of soil, is still mysterious, even to virologists.In one hypothesis, they mght have been archaic, free-living organisms that evolved into parasites in another, they started as fragmentary genetic elements that united to move between cells and invade them. Either way, they reproduce, spread, and evolve to do it more effectively.Why some viruses evolve to cause disease is another mystery. But infectious diseases can limit or reduce populations of humans or wildlife .Researching last week’s column, for example, innocently prompted by the chirping of sparrows, I was led to the latest scientific hypothesis on their modern city decline. It proposed infection by a parasite, found at high levels in the sparrows of suburban London and giving them avian malaria.Today’s column prompted by wondering about the last red squirrels of Dublin’s Howth Head. Have they finally succumbed, like so many in Leinster, to the advance of alien grey squirrels?Even a decade ago, the native reds had already disappeared from many Dublin parks. At the Phoenix Park, for example, the first grey was sighted in 1979 and the last red around 1987.On the Howth peninsula, the reds’ last stronghold in Dublin, the first greys were seen in 2007. In 2011, an assessment for Fingal County Council by ecologist Dr Wiliam Carr, estimated some 25 remaining in the woods.The narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding. Grey squirrels were regularly removed from the peninsula by Dr Carr, rising to 38 in a year. But his traps caught only two male reds. The Howth colony, he reported in 2017, “will not recover”.Grey squirrels have been commonly thought to oust the reds by competition for acorns and beech nuts. A more insidious reason, as seen in the UK, is cross-infection with the squirrel-pox virus, SPQV. The greys can carry this without much effect, but it’s fatal to the reds, afflicting them with something like the rabbit myxomatosis.Although the American greys were introduced to Ireland at Castleforbes, Co Longford, in 1911, SPQV was not discovered until 2011, found in two grey squirrel populations in Northern Ireland. At one location, 90 per cent of the reds were infected and lost.In 2012 came reports from Co Wicklow and Co Dublin. Testing levels of virus in greys from these areas, a team from UCD warned of “a wave-front of grey squirrel expansion from Wicklow” to threaten the surviving eastern reds.By 2012 just three reds – two males and one female – survived on south Dublin’s Killiney Hill. However, with greys removed by Dr Carr, that year saw reinforcement. Fifteen reds, brought from the Raven Point nature reserve in Wexford, were released in a move supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Elsewhere in Ireland, and notably in the midlands, the resurgence of the pine marten, a native predator, has proved a potent ally in removing grey squirrels and allowing the smaller, more agile, reds to share the woods.But meanwhile, another wildlife virus has arrived in Ireland, threatening not only wild rabbits but also the Irish hare.This is RHDRHD2, joint acronyms for rabbit haemorrhagic disease, a horror like myxomatosis. The first form killed millions of farmed rabbits in China in 1984 and then spread globally. RHD2, a form killing rabbits even faster, emerged in France in 2010.RHD was found in domestic rabbits in Ireland in 2018 and in wild rabbits in July last year RHD2 killed a hare on the Wexford Slobs nature reserve in August and another 17 fatally infected hares were found in eight weeks after that. The disease has been confirmed from at least eight counties, from Cork to Leitrim.Apart from the trysts of mating, the Irish hares lead solitary lives. But rounded up in nets for coursing, contagion could be inevitable. The first deaths from RHD2 last summer brought an immediate ban on coursing from Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan.By October, however, a deal was reached with the Irish Coursing Club. A ban remains on netting within a 25km radius of finding the disease in hares or rabbits. It was lifted for Kilkenny and for other clubs enlisted in a hare monitoring programme supervised by vets.Moving west 40-odd years ago brought me encounters with dying rabbits, blundering around my feet in the dunes. They were victims of myxomatosis, imported by Irish farming interests. Natural selection of survivors brought their species eventual genetic resistance, as it will beat the even deadlier numbers game of RHD2.There are vaccines against the virus for domestic rabbits, but these remain untested for wild rabbits or hares and netting them for injection is thought too risky. I watch their solitary scampers on the hillside – a sign of the wild I hope will never grow less."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237511.1587752355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an angel at the door one family s experience of night nurse","story":"Carmel Costello was “a very young” 73-year-old when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016. It marked the beginning of a long interaction with the health system. When it became clear the illness was terminal, Carmel’s daughter Caroline explains, her only wish was to stay and die in her own home.That was not a surprise to the family given their mother had lived in her Artane house in north Dublin for 49 years. She declined hospice care and so Caroline and her sister Charmaine all but moved in permanently, taking turns to care for her.“She was never on her own,” Caroline says, looking back. “As she got worse it got to the point where the two of us needed to be there together. One of us would go to bed and the other would stay up with mum.”Things took a turn after one particularly challenging weekend. The palliative team pointed her family towards the Irish Cancer Society’s Night Nurse service. The nurse, who was called Deirdre, arrived and took over from 11pm to 7am.“I can only describe it that an angel came to the door,” says Caroline.“I can’t express how much of a difference it made to all of us as a family. It meant that we were actually able to go to bed but knowing that someone was going to be able to provide her with the care that we were able to give her during the day.”The family felt cared for, too, such was the level of quiet support. They had the comfort of knowing that they would be woken in the middle of the night if there was any deterioration in Carmel’s health.She died on a December afternoon in 2017. “She stayed in her own home until the day she died. She brought us into the world and we were there when she left it,” Caroline says.“We were able to do that because we got that support at the critical time.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireThe HSE has expressed concern over the recent announcement that testing for Covid-19 is to be significantly expanded to cover 100,000 suspected cases a week.HSE chairman Ciarán Devane wrote to Minister for Health Simon Harris in recent days, it is understood, while HSE chief executive Paul Reid wrote to the department’s secretary general, Jim Breslin.On Friday last week the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, decided the level of testing for Covid-19 should be increased to assess 100,000 people a week, operating on a seven-day-a-week basis, for a minimum of six months.Within the HSE there is understood to have been worries about capacity and concern at the process that led to the announcement of the move, as well as what was seen as a lack of consultation.Both the HSE and the Department of Health declined to answer specific questions about the letters on Friday.Government sources said the Minister had received two letters from Mr Devane in April and that neither mentioned the commitment to increase testing for Covid-19.However, other highly placed sources said the concerns were about the process that led to the announcement of the 100,000 tests per week on Friday of last week.Labour leader Alan Kelly, who raised issues around accountability in the emergency team in the Dáil on Thursday, called for the letters to be released.“I asked the Taoiseach in the Dáil if there was any correspondence from the HSE to the Government regarding governance issues. Now we know that there are, and I am calling on the Taoiseach to publish these letters and address all the issues that arise as a result of them,” Mr Kelly said.Over 1,000 deathsSeparately, the Department of Health has been notified of a further 37 deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19. The number of people who have died with confirmed or probable coronavirus in the State has exceeded 1,000.The number of additional confirmed cases of the virus is 577, bringing the total number of cases in the State to 18,184. Adjusted testing criteria, to be introduced early next week, will lead to increased referrals for testing from GPs. Dr Holohan said: “We think we should be able to do that within the existing capacity that the HSE has in place now, both in terms of the capacity to take the sample, and to test it in the laboratory.”Health officials also confirmed that five healthcare workers had died from the disease as of last Saturday evening. Some 3,830 healthcare workers had tested positive, 159 of whom had been hospitalised, and 24 were placed in intensive care.Dr Holohan reiterated concerns about complacency creeping in, and said that were the decision to be taken at the moment, “we would be sticking with the restrictions that are in place as they are”.However, Government officials are considering extending the 2km travel limit on households to 5km or possibly 10km as part of a potential future easing of restrictions. The State may also change its advice to over-70s who are “cocooning” at home so they can go outside for walks and possibly shop in supermarkets during restricted hours. They may be asked to wear masks outside their homes.Further relaxations being discussed include allowing older people to interact more with other family members.Outdoor, non-contact sports such as golf and tennis, which involve natural physical distancing, could also be permitted when restrictions start to lift.The partial reopening of primary schools with limits on class sizes and secondary schools only to Leaving Cert students ahead of exams starting on July 29th could also be permitted.

A Co Tipperary farmer has joined a class action lawsuit against the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl after he and four friends contracted Covid-19 during their week-long stay last month.At least 5,000 people, hailing from Iceland to Israel, have registered interest with an Austrian lawyer who suspects the village, local businesses and the region of Tyrol ignored health warnings about Ischgl being a Covid-19 hotspot.“This isn’t about monetary gain, someone has to be answerable because there was wrong done,” said Brendan Bourke (53), from Killea near Templemore.Mr Bourke and four friends flew out from Dublin on February 29th for a week’s holidays in Ischgl. They had four good days of skiing and spent their evenings in village bars, where there were occasional coronavirus jokes but no real concerns.He said the bars were “always jam-packed with people” and that “from a certain time of the evening staff have to blow whistles to get through with their glasses”.On March 6th, a day before they left, one of Mr Bourke’s group developed a cough just as they first heard about Covid-19 cases in Iceland among people returning from Ischgl.A day earlier Icelandic health officials warned their Austrian counterparts of 14 skiers having returned from the village with Covid-19. The Austrians suggested they could have picked up the virus on the plane back.Similar clusters were soon reported among Ischgl returnees in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Norway believes 40 per cent of its Covid-19 cases can be traced to the Alpine village.Mr Bourke says he fell ill three days after returning, experiencing a cough, back and neck pain, shortness of breath and pressure in his chest.Between returning and falling ill, he attended two rugby events, visited a meat factory and at least one farm and did two school runs. He had tea with his neighbour but told his 91-year-old mother, who lives next door, to keep her distance.Super-spreaderOnce diagnosed, Mr Bourke self-isolated and neither his wife nor children have developed symptoms, nor have those with whom he had contact on his return.All four of his friends tested positive after returning and had mild symptoms one infected his wife and 10-month-old baby as well as four people in his office.While sick at home on around March 12th, Mr Bourke logged on to the Ischgl website and, via a webcam, was amazed to see skiers still on the slopes. Days later, Ischgl made world headlines as a super-spreader Covid-19 “catapult village”.Austrian lawyer Peter Kolba, organiser of the class action suit, says he is aware of 11 Covid-19 deaths to date of people with direct or indirect links to Ischgl.More than 500 people have already given him power of attorney in his suit, seeking answers on the eight-day gap between the Icelandic warning and the Ischgl shut-down.“Our main focus is on the authorities who, we suspect, acted too slowly with massive pressure from the tourism industry and powerful ski lift companies,” said Dr Kolba.Local mayor Werner Kurz has hit back at international criticism, saying the village acted in line with official advice as quickly as possible.“No one knew this virus, it was a new situation for all,” he said.Apart from a persistent cough, Mr Bourke says he has recovered from Covid-19 but has mixed feelings now.“There’s a sign in the main street in Ischgl, the first thing you see, that reads ‘Relax if you can’,” he said. “I can’t relax because of what happened there. I just hope there’s no longer-term health damage.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday. The EU has emphasised that agreement of a deal depends on Britain demonstrating that it is enacting prior agreements, including on arrangements for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, which the EU insists entails regulatory, sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods entering the North from Britain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But potato farmers are hard hit by the country’s lockdown measures, which were imposed in mid-March and closed restaurants.“Let us all eat French fries twice instead of once a week, Romain Cools, secretary general of Belgapom, the trade association for potato growers, said. Even though the country’s iconic frites shacks were given special dispensation to stay open, many shut because of the pandemic. Those that stayed open have seen customer levels drop. The damage was compounded by the cancellation of Belgium’s many music festivals, where frites are eaten in huge quantities.  Belgium is one of the largest exporters of frozen fries in the world, exporting 2.3 million tonnes every year. But Mr Cools told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper that the freezers were full and that the potatoes risked going to waste.He said a campaign with an anti-food waste organisation and supermarkets would soon be launched to ask Belgians to eat more chips at home, rather than at the traditional fritkot. Even Belgians cannot be expected to munch through three quarter of a million tonnes of tatties, Mr Cools admitted. “We are also working on sales to Central European countries that want to make starch from it, and it is also used to make animal feed and even electricity,” he said. Belgapom is also sending 25 tonnes of potatoes to food banks every week until the end of May and possibly longer. “Our entire potato chain is happy that, thanks to this action, we also contribute to providing the weakest in our society with tasty and healthy potatoes,” Mr Cools said.Frites are thought to have been fried in Belgium since the 17th Century. Legend has it that American soldiers serving in World War One incorrectly named Belgian frites “French fries” and the name stuck.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"captain tom moore becomes oldest chart topper uk number one","story":"Captain Tom Moore has reached number one with his charity single and become oldest person ever to top the UK chartsThe 99-year-old Second World War veteran has tirelessly raised more than £28 million for frontline services during the Covid-19 pandemic by performing laps of his garden. Captain Moore released a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone with Michael Ball, who has also achieved his first number one, in a bid to raise further funds.Days away from his 100th birthday he has officially become the oldest person to top the UK charts.His recording with the NHS Voices of Care Choir has also become the fastest-selling single of 2020, according to the Official Charts Company. Captain Tom will still hold top spot when he turns 100 on April 30th, and the record-breaker’s grandchildren are stunned by his achievement.He is now the holder of two Guinness World Records, having become the oldest person to top the UK charts, and also raised the most money as an inidual through a charity walk.Speaking from his home in Bedfordshire, where he lives with his daughter Hannah, the veteran said: “What wonderful news to receive today, a number one  single and a record breaker too.  “My grandchildren can’t believe I am a chart-topper.“I have to thank Michael Ball, the NHS Voices of Care Choir and everyone behind the scenes, who shared their talents and expertise in order to raise money for the NHS, to whom we owe so much. “And, of course, the public for buying the single and donating.“We’re in this together, and I am forever grateful for your support.

The Prime Minister had issued what he called a “simple” instruction to the country to “stay at home”. But he had also added a caveat. People could go out to work “where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home”.The business in question was a manufacturer, definitely not a work-from-the-sofa-in-pyjamas sort of operation. So perhaps the answer was yes. The legislation came out and, after scouring it, the owner could see nothing forbidding him from operating, so long as he took some social distancing measures. He had two months’ cash and a full order book and who knew how long the lockdown would last? So he told staff that work would continue. But the workforce had been bombarded by messages telling them they risked death if they went outside. The message came back loud and clear: “No.”The Government has now explained that its main virus control strategy after the lockdown will be to test, contact-trace and isolate potential cases, along the lines of successful Asian examples. This is the only viable exit route from lockdown. What we do not yet know is what can reopen and when. As the business example above shows, it is not as simple as it seems when reading a script into a camera lens at Number 10.For one thing, the Government has been bashing us over the head with the same message for a month: “Stay at home or you’ll die!” We get it constantly from letters, TV ads, radio ads, online ads, text messages and all the rest. This campaign has been extraordinarily successful. Contact between households has all but evaporated, deaths and new cases have levelled off, the NHS is still functioning and polls show enormous public support for the measures. At some point, however, even though the risk of getting the virus can never be wholly removed, the message will need to change and the new rules need to be clear. Let’s not come out of lockdown in the same way we went into it, with some garbled message like, “It’s probably fine to reopen.”This won’t be easy to manage because, as chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said, we don’t yet know what mix of activity will optimise economic and social wellbeing while keeping the epidemic under control. What is clear is that the new regime will have a very low tolerance for any rise in transmission rates because of the worry that growth can quickly become exponential and overwhelm the health service. This low risk tolerance is necessary for the economy too in order to build public confidence and improve the working and business environment. If we are living in constant fear of a second lockdown, furloughs will start to turn into redundancies.There is some evidence that the extent of the lockdown we are in is not necessary to keep the epidemic under control. A handful of European countries have implemented slightly softer regimes. Sweden, at the most liberal end, is probably not an example to follow, given its relatively high death rate compared to its direct peers. But the Netherlands, whose epidemic is now shrinking, may have achieved a good balance.On paper, the Dutch rules are similar to Britain’s, but its regime is actually somewhat less severe. Whereas the Netherlands acted early and saw the volume of shoppers and commuters halve, the UK acted a little later and then saw falls of 70-80 per cent. We swung from insouciance, when parks and street markets were packed in defiance of the Government’s advice, to immediate docility when the cops were sent out.The Dutch government’s analysis of various distancing measures has now concluded that whereas banning large gatherings and encouraging people to work from home were essential to control the epidemic, closing cafes and schools probably had little effect. School closures, of course, have a huge economic impact since they deprive most families of childcare.Aside from getting the rules right, the Government needs also to create the right incentives and communicate them effectively. Managers should not be in the dark about whether they are allowed to operate. The Government should not be sending letters, as business secretary Alok Sharma did last week, suggesting in one breath that “there is no restriction on manufacturing continuing under the current rules” and then implying, in the next, that active businesses should be “playing a direct role in combatting Covid-19”. Businesses should not be left worrying about whether they are legally liable if they ask staff to work and then get sued by an employee who gets ill.This is all the more delicate because although it has undoubtedly saved millions of jobs, the furloughing regime has also created a new set of incentives. Many employees, especially those with medical conditions, elderly relatives living with them or children to look after, might rather be at home on 80 per cent of pay than at work for the extra 20.Most businesses do not want to have threaten to fire their staff in order to get them into work and do not want workers to feel they are risking their lives at work or on the transport method they use to get in. At some point, it will have to be made clear that the country cannot allow millions of workers to stay at home at taxpayers’ expense, even if the risk of contagion can only be minimised and never eliminated. The furloughing system will have to taper off. Managed wrongly, this could become toxic, especially given that it is disproportionately working-class jobs that really cannot be done from home.The future is moving slowly into view. It is one where schools, restaurants and factories are up and running, where life has returned to some semblance of normal. But it is also one where we are still obsessing over clean hands, walking oddly far apart from one another and dreaming idly of the day when we can go abroad, attend a sports match or even just convene a book club and have tea with granny.The precursor to any economic recovery and growing confidence is a public released from living in confusion and fear.

The first came on March 27, a 62-year-old woman who passed after initially being diagnosed with allergies. The second happened the next day. A man, 70, had been rushed to a hospital 40 miles away with shortness of breath but never recovered. The tragedies have mounted since then, including in the last week - two on Saturday and one each on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. Eighteen Covid-19 fatalities in less than a month. “It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Chapman, the coroner of Randolph County. “The phone has been ringing off the hook for days.” The suffering in this corner of rural southwest Georgia could be missed in a pandemic that has already claimed more than 200,000 lives worldwide. But it now tops a morbid list. It is the county with the highest coronavirus death rate in America. The number of fatalities here as a proportion of population exceeds anywhere else in the US, including New York. Limited access to health care, an elderly population and high levels of poverty could all be a factor. And it is not alone - the Covid-19 cases in America’s South are surging. Yet at the same time Republican governors are reopening businesses, including in Georgia, where tattoo parlours and spas were allowed to open on Friday, prompting national headlines. Even Donald Trump, the US president who has urged reopenings, criticised governor Brian Kemp for the move, tweeting that he had not approved the decision. Why has Randolph County, with a population of just 6,800, been hit so hard? To understand, The  talked to local leaders, emergency workers and friends of the deceased.  The picture that emerged, of warnings ignored and a community shattered by disease, can be found across America. As the virus spreads into the countryside, it could be repeated.Mr Chapman, 62, updates the paper list from his dining room table at home in Cuthbert, one of the country’s two “cities”, though really the size of villages. He has been coroner for 12 years and is used to death. But the rate of dying this last month - twice as high as in normal times - has left him shaken. “It’s been at the peak of what I can handle,” Mr Chapman said. “It’s been a challenge to keep up with, that’s for sure.” It is not known how the virus reached the county - with limited resources to track back that is unlikely to change - but the ground zero is clear.  The Joe-Anne Burgin Nursing Home has seen more than a dozen deaths, most believed to be related to Covid-19. Around half of those at the home have tested positive. People who died from Covid-19 there, like all those in the county, were aged over 60. Many had underlying health conditions such as diabetes or past heart problems. The scale of death and size of community means many residents have a personal connection to those who have passed, amplifying the emotional impact.  That is true of Steve Whatley, the mayor of Cuthbert. He has spent all of his life in the city, which has a little over 3,000 people. Last weekend Lucy Hobbs, once a classmate from the local school, was taken by the virus aged just 66. They had been born six months apart.  “The death rate has been unbelievable. These are not just figures to us. These are people we know and are friends with and have a relationship with,” he said. “It has certainly been traumatic, to say the least. With a small community like we’ve got, a close-knit community, it really hits home in a large way.” It is not the first time this area has experienced hardship. Hurricane Michael caused devastation in 2018 when it swept through, ruining houses and leaving people displaced.  “Nobody died, that’s the difference,” Mr Whatley said. He called watching this invisible killer sweep through his hometown “surreal”.“It’s in the Lord’s hands, he added. The virus’s impact has been especially felt on the religious community. The county is in the heart of America’s Bible Belt. Cuthbert alone has more than a dozen churches.  Among the obituaries posted on a local funeral home website is one for Alfred Starling, an African-American reverend. He was another lifelong resident taken by Covid-19 earlier this month, aged 65.  His inviting personality matched his flair for style he was a sharp dresser who always kept a handsome smile on his face,” read one line.   Pastor David Hamm, whose church had the reverend as a member, echoed the warm words. “Great guy, humble guy. He drove school buses for many years.” Pastor Hamm, 43, is no longer giving services in person. The doors to his church are shut, replaced by online broadcasts every Sunday.  But he is still doing funerals. He has overseen four burials for coronavirus victims. No more than 10 mourners can attend, to curb potential spread. Those who do must wear masks.  “They were very troublesome to the families because many of them are distinguished people, well known people. You can’t have a proper burial,” he said. Normally Pastor Hamm would give a whole sermon of remembrance in the church. Now, there are just a few words of comfort by the grave.“They couldn’t say goodbye properly,” he said. But why has Randolph County, with its miles of corn and cotton fields, been so badly hit? Demographics could be one factor.  Around a third of residents live in poverty, according to the latest US Census data. A quarter are aged over 65, so especially vulnerable. Other nearby counties also appear near the top of the death rate list, produced by Prof Gary Wagner from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Another factor could be not adhering to social distancing. One resident said locals did not change their behaviour quickly enough as the virus emerged.  The person described a barbecue taking place with more than 100 people earlier this month and said many still visited their families on Easter weekend.  A third is healthcare. The county only has one ambulance to cover 430 square miles. It has only one small hospital, which has had to draft in medical experts to fill staffing gaps. Ambulances from other counties can take calls, but then there is the dilemma of where to take them. Bigger hospitals - in Albany or Columbus or Dothan - are around an hour’s drive. Ken Burns, 51, the county’s emergency manager (and also fire chief), criticised Mr Kemp’s decision to let businesses reopen, fearing it would lead to more deaths. “It’s way too soon,” he said. “We’re still on our growth rate. I see three more spikes coming here and that’s before you even mention opening up.”Back at his dining room table, Mr Chapman too expects more deaths. But his piece of paper, tallying those lost in a county he has called home all his life, is almost out of space. I’m going to have to turn it over or start another one, he said, considering the weeks ahead. “The front page is filled up.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/03/10/TELEMMGLPICT000227447964_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHFpKXeXCxMIMJz8yhX7SwjhqJjatWbAoPNpik4CultM.jpeg?im","title":"west must ensure china pays role spread covid 19","story":"The dominance of Xi Jinping\u0026#39s China cannot go unchallenged by the WestChina, we all know, is run by an autocratic, dictatorial regime which brooks no dissent and is highly secretive about the problems and challenges the country faces. That has been the case for very many years. However, although its behaviour does seem to be getting worse, logic would nevertheless still dictate that when faced with the outbreak of a novel disease the Chinese government would work hard to contain it. That was certainly the case in 2002, when China responded to Sars by working with the World Health Organisation to bring the disease under control. So why, when Covid-19 was discovered, did China instead respond with what many believe to be cynical lies and denials? The Chinese authorities were alerted to the threat the outbreak posed when human-to-human transmission was confirmed in early December, just as they were about to sign a trade deal with the USA ending the damaging standoff between the two countries. Was the reason that the government closed down any mention of the outbreak through December and January to protect this deal? Phase 1 of the deal was set to lift tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese exports. However, if the deal hadn’t been agreed on December 15 then the US intended to impose wider sanctions on Chinese exports. As it happened, the deal was agreed on December 15 2019 and then signed exactly a month later on January 15. This was a critical period. Any indication in this time that China had a serious health crisis which may have pointed the finger at their biological labs andor their appalling wet markets could have led to wider sanctions being applied.During this vital period, the Chinese authorities systematically suppressed whistle blowers. Dr Li Wenliang, who first publicly raised the outbreak, was silenced and later died, but he was not alone. He had been reporting observations made by Dr Ai Fen earlier in December 2019 and there were others who observed the human-to-human nature of transmission, a vital fact denied by the Chinese authorities at the time. According to The Lancet medical journal there were at least six known human-to-human cases before December 15 and strong indications this had happened in November. Yet it wasn’t until December 31 that it was first reported to the WHO.All the while, China’s President, Xi Jinping, publicly maintained that everything was under control and only on January 28 did he meet Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO. This meeting led to a public health statement of “an emergency of international concern”. Yet at the same time, inexplicably, Dr Tedros applauded the Chinese authorities, saying, “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak … and the transparency they have demonstrated.”It looks as though the Chinese state placed achieving a trade deal with the US ahead of ensuring the proper systems were in place to manage the outbreak. Yet this is, it seems, a normal pattern of behaviour from a state growing in economic and military power. Just look at the strategic way that China set out to dominate areas of the world which have important raw materials. At present, China owns nearly 20 per cent of Africa’s debt with a combined loan total of $152 billion to 49 African governments. This is one tactic among many that has secured China’s control of around 85 per cent of the world’s supply of rare earth metals, which go into the production of all electronics. Whether it is ripping off technology from Western countries, driving other businesses out of the marketplace by aggressive and state-backed bidding or even economically colonising countries in Africa, China believes, rightly as it turns out, that the West has become too weak for it to fear. Nothing demonstrates Chinese arrogance or disregard of us better than its handling of coronavirus.The problem is that the West has blithely assumed that access to our free markets would lead China to democracy and increased freedoms. Yet instead of free trade causing the country to open up, as its dominance of the world marketplace has expanded, China has instead tightened up with greater central control and more abuses of human rights. Pathetically, after years of Project Kow Tow, we rarely if ever confront it about its behaviour. It is vital that we change all that and break our dependence on this terrible regime. The Government now needs to set up a commission with experts and senior politicians to examine how we can change and rebalance our relationship with China as we emerge from this crisis. There will be a need for financial reparations for the damage it has inflicted. We also need to ensure that China doesn’t exploit its economic power to avoid taking responsibility for this appalling pandemic. Working with other allies, we have to ensure that we never allow such an autocratic regime, one that abuses human rights and ignores the rules-based international order, to become so dominant again. Sir Iain Duncan Smith is a former leader of the Conservative PartyCoronavirus latest news: \u0026#39We are not out of danger yet\u0026#39 says Priti Patel, as death toll tops 20,000 Coronavirus: Government website overwhelmed for second time as key workers try to book tests onlineDonald Trump \u0026#39set to scale back\u0026#39 appearances at White House coronavirus briefingsPublic Health England\u0026#39s plan for coronavirus \u0026#39totally negligent\u0026#39, says leading specialistDoctor turned writer tops tsunami memoir as first novel nets Hollywood film dealEU leaders \u0026#39must intervene to break Brexit trade talks impasse\u0026#39\u0026#39I wasn\u0026#39t the ambitious one\u0026#39: Fugitive mastermind behind world\u0026#39s biggest art scam breaks silence The vain risk coronavirus as black market hairdressers make house callsNursing home infected with coronavirus decontaminated for free after care workers featured in Sunday Anti-lockdown protest led by Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s brother Piers is shut down by policeDaughter\u0026#39s love of science prompts family to sign up for Oxford vaccine trialToday\u0026#39s young are twice as likely as parents to experience \u0026#39quarter life crisis,\u0026#39 study findsHow \u0026#39safe\u0026#39 countries could start forming regional alliances to keep trade and tourism goingKim Jong-un\u0026#39s successor: Who would lead North Korea if he died?What needs to happen for UK lockdown to be lifted - and when is it reviewed?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china sends experts advise north koreanleader kim jong un sources","story":"China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, according to three people familiar with the situation.The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Mr Kim\u0027s health.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party\u0027s International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.The sources declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter.The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China\u0027s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Mr Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Mr Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.On Thursday, US President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Mr Kim was gravely ill. I think the report was incorrect, Mr Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Mr Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Mr Kim\u0027s current condition or any Chinese involvement.An official familiar with US intelligence said that Mr Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.A US State department spokeswoman had no comment. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Mr Kim\u0027s health on Fox News after Mr Trump spoke said: I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we\u0027re watching the situation very keenly.North Korea is one of the world\u0027s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts or condition.North Korea\u0027s state media last reported on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, an important anniversary in North Korea.Mr Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un\u0027s father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea\u0027s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by UN sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Mr Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Mr Trump held unprecedented summits with Mr Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living slob brings liberation lockdown","story":"Martin Daubney: Is anybody else secretly delighted that the coronavirus has allowed home-bound men to regress into bedraggled chimps with the personal hygiene regimes of heavy metal roadies?Before lockdown, I’d always prided myself on my dapper appearance. My wardrobe is filled with racks of sharp designer suits that I’d normally wear for my television or political work.Yet such pointless peacockery seems an age away now. In five weeks, we’ve turned into a nation of slobs. Joyously, this week the nation’s men found an unlikely style icon in, of all people, comedian Martin Clunes when he appeared on Good Morning Britain in his pyjamas. One Twitter user wrote that appearing before the nation in jimjams was now “the ultimate boss move”.Suitably inspired by Clunes, this week I took part in a six-man international Zoom conference for the charity I co-founded, the Men \u0026amp Boys Coalition. Normally business-minded events, the mood was greatly lightened by the total lack of effort we each put into our appearances. I wore jogging bottoms and a fleece-lined shirt (I’d just finished painting a door), but was trumped by a colleague in Australia, who appeared in shorts and flip-flops – while eating a burger in his Camper van.Getting dressed of a morning no longer means asking yourself of an outfit “Does it look good?” but “Does it smell OK?” And, I must confess, it’s been liberating.With clothing sales reportedly down a record 34 per cent – largely due to mothballed high streets – how many of us will go on to reset our relationship with expensive clothing? Did Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg – who always wears identical grey outfits – have it right all along? All this vanity, who is it for? What is the point of dressing up?And then there’s personal hygiene. I’ve always been a fastidious groomer, but now it seems like a waste of lounging time. I must confess that three days without a shower is becoming commonplace – something I’d only previously do during a severe bout of man flu.Record amounts of us might be googling “how do I cut my own hair?”, but I can’t even bring myself to attempt a self-inflicted crew cut that’s been called the “coronavirus crop”. Instead, I’m just letting it all grow wild, head and beard. If lockdown goes on much longer, I shall resemble Saddam Hussein when he was finally dragged out of his bunker in 2003, a tangle of a madman’s beard, dressing gown and sandals worn with socks.Getting dressed no longer means asking yourself ‘Does it look good?’ but ‘Does it smell OK?’In lockdown Britain, the fripperies of vanity seem pointless and hollow. Perhaps they always were? Last week, when comedian Russell Howard went on Lorraine Kelly’s breakfast show looking unkempt and proceeded to crack open a can of Thatcher’s cider – keen-eyed viewers spotting that he took “40 sips” at 9.15am – he wasn’t called a lush, but “a lockdown legend”. When wearing pyjamas to work or drinking strong cider at breakfast is celebrated, you know revolution is in the air.For professional men in lockdown, fashion, grooming and even personal hygiene (fastidious hand-washing aside) are temporarily obsolete. No doubt when the pandemic is over, most of us will return to our old ways. But we’re not thinking about going back to our suits and double-cuff shirts until the nation’s dry cleaners and barber shops reopen.Helen Kirwan-Taylor: According to Unilever, shoppers have been shunning shampoos and deodorant during lockdown. If only that was it. On my shunned list are: clean clothes actually, clothes in general, apart from my new yellow sweatpants from Hush which I bought to match my Marigold rubber gloves hairbrushes make-up soap (apart from to wash my hands) nail files, irons dental floss sunscreen. The list is long.Like most women of a certain age I used to have a beauty routine. Every few months I visited my wonderful stylist, Fred Gielly for highlights. Manicures and pedicure appointments were dotted into my diary along with leg and bikini waxes. I maintained some semblance of youth thanks to regular sunspot zapping, chez Dr. Jean Louis Sebagh. Sun was once the enemy: now it’s an essential part of corona combat.I might look ten years older, but who knows - I don’t look in the mirror much. If you don’t wear make-up, you don’t need to use cleanser or cream, even. I simply splash and go. I wash my hair only when it leaves an oil trail on my pillowcase (I wash one or the other but not both).I might look 10 years older, but who knows – I don’t look in the mirror muchSometimes I look like a bag lady. I hate doing laundry so I keep my apron on most of the day, along with my washing up gloves (to cover the state of my hands). I figure, why take them off as I spend most of my time in the kitchen as it is? Besides, it’s good Covid19 practice. Ironing requires coordination and patience so forget that.It’s not just me who’s turned Neanderthal. Wilson, our cairn terrier, normally goes to the groomers to be hand stripped. Now he looks like a woolly mammoth (he also smells of manure but I’m used to it.)Some of my girlfriends are trying to dye their own hair (it’s a shocker if you are dark). I know Josh Woods is sending emergency kits all over the country but you can still tell who has cheated and snuck in their colourist. One woman in my village calls herself the “root Stasi”.  She knows a professional job when she sees one (and reports it). I figure if you don’t look in the mirror too often, the grey bothers you less.Occasionally I pass someone on a village lane (the odour hits you half a mile away) and think, ‘Oh, there’s a bum,’ - then I recognise him. I spoke to a friend last night that admitted she stays in her nightie until dinnertime. Anderson \u0026amp Sheppard, the Haberdashery store in Mayfair, tells me they’re selling more bathrobes than ever—proof that everyone has stopped bothering to dress.It’s not just grooming standards that are slipping. For the first few weeks of lockdown, I cleaned manically. Now I accept that spiders and woodlice have rights too, so we leave each other alone. For Covid protection, however, I treat the kitchen like an operating theatre: I even use fairy liquid to clean vegetables.In some ways, self-isolation is a good thing. My husband and I put garlic in *everything*. In the old days, I might have worried about my breath, but now I figure anyone who smells it, deserves it, for breaching protocol. I’ve put away all the deodorants and perfume bottles in my bathroom and replaced them with home made hand sanitisers.I still shower, but quickly, so I don’t have too close a look at what is growing where. I’m not that worried, as I reckon we won’t be wearing bathing suits any time soon.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000229951124_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM3F4J5q1UP41khh_YGSE8mWFU7hGdFMCpB14_zMQxyA.jpeg?imwidth","title":"politicians have good ideas machinery delivering needs improve","story":"\u0026#39Ministers such as Matt Hancock are right to make changes with how the public sector operates\u0026#39Governments need two things: a vision, and the ability to deliver. There has been no shortage of the former recently from Ministers keen to come up with big ideas to tackle Covid-19. But the delivery of the vision has been uneven. What we need is for the coronavirus crisis to be a reset moment when we leave behind anything that stops public services delivering as well as they should.First, the successes. Much of the NHS has changed its ways of working in a way that would have been unimaginable three months ago. At the end of last year, 90 per cent of GP consultations were held face-to-face. Faced with the outbreak, GPs switched to online and telephone consultations overnight. General practice has opened its eyes to the technology that the rest of us take for granted and it will never go back.Hospitals have been just as innovative. Outpatient appointments have become virtual. There has been a bonfire of red tape. Staff have been allowed to re-train in new disciplines in a way that traditional professional guidance would not have allowed.The relationship of the NHS with the private health sector has also changed for the better. At the beginning of the crisis, a deal to give the NHS access to every private hospital in the country took less than a week to complete. The number of ventilators has increased, partly due to new partnerships with industry. Some hospitals, such as the Warrington NHS Foundation Trust, have pioneered alternatives to ventilators.But there are other less successful areas. Health authorities set up a new regional infrastructure to supply PPE which turned out to be unreliable. The Government has now enlisted eBay to allow NHS workers to personally order PPE – a fantastic idea, but one that should have happened weeks ago.   Testing has also been slow to get going. The UK did not prioritise testing and contact-tracing in the way that Asian countries did. The first efforts to provide testing facilities for NHS staff required them to use private transport and to drive long distances, making it impossible for some to get tested. Public health authorities have been slow to embrace technology which can trace people who have come into contact with coronavirus carriers, so allowing the lifting of a blanket lockdown. GPs have shown what can be achieved when public authorities are willing to be flexible and embrace new ways of working. It is an example that needs to be followed more widely, especially as future developments in healthcare, as well as in other areas of the public sector, are likely to be driven by technology, such as the power of big data and 5G networks.It matters that ministers such as Matt Hancock are authorising public services to change wherever they need to. Delivery, after all, is where our politicians will be judged.Coronavirus latest news: \u0026#39We are not out of danger yet\u0026#39 says Priti Patel, as death toll tops 20,000 Coronavirus: Government website overwhelmed for second time as key workers try to book tests onlineDonald Trump \u0026#39set to scale back\u0026#39 appearances at White House coronavirus briefingsPublic Health England\u0026#39s plan for coronavirus \u0026#39totally negligent\u0026#39, says leading specialistDoctor turned writer tops tsunami memoir as first novel nets Hollywood film dealEU leaders \u0026#39must intervene to break Brexit trade talks impasse\u0026#39\u0026#39I wasn\u0026#39t the ambitious one\u0026#39: Fugitive mastermind behind world\u0026#39s biggest art scam breaks silence The vain risk coronavirus as black market hairdressers make house callsNursing home infected with coronavirus decontaminated for free after care workers featured in Sunday Anti-lockdown protest led by Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s brother Piers is shut down by policeDaughter\u0026#39s love of science prompts family to sign up for Oxford vaccine trialToday\u0026#39s young are twice as likely as parents to experience \u0026#39quarter life crisis,\u0026#39 study findsHow \u0026#39safe\u0026#39 countries could start forming regional alliances to keep trade and tourism goingKim Jong-un\u0026#39s successor: Who would lead North Korea if he died?What needs to happen for UK lockdown to be lifted - and when is it reviewed?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"postcard berlin coming back life lockdown","story":"The lockdown is being partially lifted today. Shops will be allowed to open for the first time in a month across most of Germany, but Berlin has to wait. The regional government is still arguing over when to lift restrictions, so frustrated Berliners can only watch on television or pop across the border to the neighbouring state of Brandenburg.Amid the general euphoria, Angela Merkel dampens the mood. She has told colleagues she’s furious at the “orgy of reopening talk”. It’s a very unMerkellian turn of phrase, which suggests she’s genuinely worried the lockdown is being lifted too quickly.Later she gives a press conference, warning there’s a long way to go in the fight against the virus.The slide and sandpit I ordered for our small patch of garden have arrived. Lockdown has not been easy with a toddler who has just learned to walk and is eager to explore. When he discovered the local playground had been roped off he threw a tantrum and demanded to be let in. With no reopening of the playgrounds in sight, I’ve decided to try to put together our own version in the garden.Merkel is rowing back on yesterday’s remarks. She’s released a video statement saying she didn’t mean to stifle discussion. Until now the crisis seemed to have reignited the Germans’ love for Mutti, but her latest comments have ided opinion. A lot of people want an end to the lockdown and life to return to normal.The shops in Berlin are finally open again. I head into the city centre and find myself stuck in a serious traffic jam. When I finally make it, there’s a feeling of euphoria on the streets. The Berlin authorities have warned people not to take the reopening as an excuse for a stroll, but on a glorious spring day many are doing precisely that.I’m there to report but I find myself caught up in the general mood, buying a takeaway coffee and enjoying it in the sun. People are sitting on benches and the seats outside closed restaurants.Some are wearing masks but many are not. But most stick to the social distancing guidelines. There are queues to get inside the shops but it’s all good-natured.The trial of an alleged former Syrian intelligence officer for crimes against humanity begins in western Germany. The charges are a depressing reminder that life in Syria is immeasurably worse than our own rather comfortable crisis — and it\u0027s been going on there for nine years.Merkel’s at it again. She’s laid into the regional governments in parliament, accusing them of rushing to lift the lockdown too soon. The crosstrainer I ordered is delivered. With the local gym shut for the foreseeable future, I need some exercise. I’m slowly turning our home into a retreat from the world. This virus is making recluses of us all.Facemasks are going to be compulsory from on public transport from next week but there’s a shortage of the proper, medical ones, and they can’t be reused anyway, so people are advised to sew their own “everyday masks”.I’m not much good with a needle and thread so I settle for a scarf, which is permitted so long as it covers the mouth and nose. I try it out on a trip to the shops and feel like a bank robber.One of the best things about the German lockdown is that there’s never been a restriction on leaving the house for some fresh air.We’re free to go out as much as we like, so my wife and I take our son to Sanssouci Palace, just outside Berlin, where Frederick the Great of Prussia spent much of his time in self-imposed lockdown.The palace is closed but the gardens have been turned into a stunning park.Sanssouci, of course, means without a care, and for a moment, amid the spring flowers and the sun-dappled pathways, it’s possible to forget about the coronavirus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public health englands plan coronavirus totally negligent says","story":"Public Health England\u0027s approach to coronavirus has been totally negligent, according to a leading specialist, who also suggests the agency wasted resources by helping overseas.Dr John Ashton, the former director of public health in the North West, says he was concerned by an increasing workload which should have been left to the Department for International Development (Dfid).Long-haul air miles carried out by staff almost doubled - from 2.8 million miles to 5.1 million miles - over three years, according to the latest annual reports, as part of what the agency described as a one-HMG approach to global health.With one of those emerging threats turning out to be coronavirus, Dr Ashton, who retired from the NHS in 2013 as PHE was launched, said the agency should have been quicker to respond. PHE\u0027s time would have been better spent, he said, ensuring testing facilities were up to scratch throughout the country.It\u0027s been inadequate and they have failed to catch up with themselves even when it was shown to be inadequate, he told The .We\u0027ve known that influenza has had the potential to do this, especially a mutant virus of the kind we\u0027ve seen. We\u0027ve known this is something that is possible to happen and they should have been on top of all the way through.The  disclosed four weeks ago how ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a pandemic amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE).Codenamed Exercise Cygnus, the three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016 tested how NHS hospitals and other services would cope in the event of a major flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to Covid-19. Dr Ashton said the ongoing failure to prepare was totally negligent.The actual preparedness side is being neglected and then the failure to follow through with this big exercise is totally negligent, he said. They didn\u0027t follow through on that.Ashton, who was a key whistleblower after the Hillsborough tragedy, also expressed disappointment at the make up of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the key Government advisory group. There’s not a single director of public health or experienced public health practitioner on Sage, he said. I can’t imagine that the steering group for HS2 wouldn\u0027t include any real engineers.Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014.Dr Ashton added: Public Health England have been doing a lot of international work, and really it was the work of Dfid. Given they\u0027ve had such a reduction in their budget and resources, they should have been focusing on the core function of what Public Health England was set up to do, which is national, regional and local.On the one hand, they\u0027ve taken their eye of the ball and been doing more international work, and on the other hand, they\u0027ve neglected the regions and local public health teams. That\u0027s shown with this because they\u0027ve been depending on Colendale labs for the testing and they weren\u0027t able to rope in the other labs, which seem to have been deprived of resources. Some of them seem to have been run down.In response, Duncan Selbie, PHE’s Chief Executive said: “This is wrong in so many ways. There will be a right time to reflect on who did what or should have done what but that time is not now. Right now, PHE is focused solely on the job of responding to Covid-19 and I am proud of our people and their many contributions and the Secretary of State has publicly recognised this.“On testing alone, PHE have not tried to hold this in-house or manage it nationally. We were one of the first agencies in the world to develop a sensitive test for Covid-19 and worked at pace to roll this out to a wider network of PHE and over 40 NHS labs. We have supported work to implement testing in a further network of testing centres and sites across the country as soon as it was safe and possible to do so. We have not stopped anyone doing anything. The Government’s testing strategy makes this clear.”Criticism from health bosses has centred on PHE\u0027s ability to ramp up testing, compared to the likes of Germany, which has so far maintained a far lower death rate.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/01/15/diy.jpg","title":"coronavirus work safe staff b q aston martin taylor wimpey","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.B\u0026ampQ, Aston Martin Lagonda and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey are among firms to announce plans to reopen operations all say they can implement social distancing at workAston Martin, B\u0026ampQ and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey are among a number of UK companies making plans to get staff back to work after halting their operations because of safety concerns.Retail, construction and manufacturing each face their own challenges when trying to work during a pandemic.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His song, with Michael Ball and The NHS Voices Of Care Choir, is part of his continued fundraising during the coronavirus crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe chart victory comes after his closest competitor, The Weeknd, asked his fans to support Cpt Moore, rather than back his track “Blinding Lights”.“What wonderful news to receive today, a number one single and record-breaker too – my grandchildren can’t believe I am a chart topper,” said Cpt Moore, of Bedfordshire.Captain Tom Moore gets Pride of Britain Award for raising £28m for NHSHow to send Captain Tom Moore a card for his 100th birthdayCaptain Tom Moore sent more than 40,000 cards ahead of 100th birthday“I have to thank Michael Ball, the NHS Voices Of Care Choir and everyone behind the scenes, who shared their talents and expertise in order to raise money for the NHS, to whom we owe so much.“And, of course, the public for buying the single and donating – we’re in this together, and I am forever grateful for your support.\u0026nbspAnd this just proves you’ll never walk alone.”“You’ll Never Walk Alone”\u0026nbspis now the fastest-selling single of 2020\u0026nbspaccording to the Official Charts Company, clinching the top spot with combined chart sales of 82,000 units.The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” is\u0026nbspin second place with a tally of 69,000.“This is the most extraordinary thing, one of the most proudest moments of my career, but it’s not about me, it’s about Captain Tom,”\u0026nbspBall told OfficialCharts.“Thank you for giving him a number one on his 100th birthday. You are the best, God bless ya.”Martin Talbot, chief executive Official Charts Company, added: “The sight of Captain Tom Moore and Michael Ball at the top of the official singles chart this week should lift everybody’s spirits in these extraordinary times.“We are absolutely delighted to see them at the pinnacle and setting new landmarks as they go – including a record as the oldest number one singles artist of all time.“It has been a roller coaster week, starting with a big initial lead for Captain Tom, before The Weeknd closed the gap yesterday to almost nothing – before a massive surge in the final day by Captain Tom.“Huge thanks to The Weeknd for lending his support at the eleventh hour. But this is Captain Tom’s week – congratulations sir and happy birthday for next week. You are a hero to us all.”The Weeknd asked his fans on Twitter on Thursday to support Captain Tom’s single to get him to the number one slot.At 99 years and 11 months, Captain Tom is the oldest artist to reach the top spot on the Official Singles Chart in its near 70-year history.He will also become the first centenarian to top the charts as he will turn 100 on Thursday, while he still holds the number one spot.The BBC’s Live Lounge Allstars charity cover of the Foo Fighters’ “Times Like These” entered the chart at number five within hours of release, while St Jhn’s “Roses” slipped from number two to three and Drake’s “Tootsie Slide” went from third spot to fourth.Captain Tom has also broken two Guinness World Records, including for the most money raised by an inidual charity walk, and as the oldest person to reach number one in the UK charts.The inidual charity walk record was previously held by Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who raised £27,201,900 (adjusted from £5.4m\u0026nbspaccording to inflation) in 1980.“I feel very honoured to receive recognition from Guinness World Records,” Cpt Moore said.“My charity walk has raised more money than I could have possibly imagined and I am so thankful to those who have donated money and bought the single so we could achieve these records together and raise money for our incredible NHS during these difficult times.“These really are Guinness World Records titles for all of us.”Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday said: “Tom’s remarkable efforts prove that age should never be a barrier to making a difference, to inspiring the nation or to breaking world records.“The fact that this indomitable 99-year-old has achieved all three of these things makes him truly a national hero that rightly deserves his place in the history books.“We’re proud to be able to welcome him into the Guinness World Records family.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Roald Dahl, 25543.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Gremlins is about small creatures responsible for mechanical failings on aeroplanes. It was written for Walt Disney Productions in anticipation of a film being made, but this never came to fruition.According to Hansons Auctioneers, the book also contains corrections made by Dahl in pencil. It is apparently one of just 50 books published for Dahl’s personal distribution.Alexander’s daughter, Juliet, said her mother and two sisters grew up in Llandaff in Cardiff and often played with Dahl’s sisters as children.The 40 best books to read while you’re self-isolating‘The Grapes of Wrath’ shows how far kindness can endure“How coincidental, then, that later my father and Dahl served together in the RAF during the Second World War,” the 75-year-old, now based in Ontario, Canada, said.“As the only living family member left in Canada, and without heirs, my intention is to ensure now that this copy earns the status it deserves, whether it be to an avid collector or a Dahl museum,” she said.Jim Spencer, of Hansons Auctioneers, said the book was a “remarkable collector\u0027s item”.“Not only does it take us back to Dahl\u0027s early days as a published author, that personal note provides an insight into the warmth of his character and regard for a wartime friend,” he said.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Exterminating bats blamed for Covid-19 ‘would increase disease risk’Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A new study finds that it may, although not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in autumn.The study, done by ecological modellers at the University of Connecticut, understands the main natural weapon against the novel germ to be ultraviolet light — an invisible but energetic part of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum that’s well-known for damaging DNA, killing viruses and turning healthy human skin cells into cancerous ones.“We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower Covid-19 growth rates,” the scientists wrote in a publication that has not yet been peer-reviewed and that went online late Wednesday. Projections of the overall effects, they continued, suggest that the disease “will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter”. But they cautioned that uncertainty about the study’s projected outcomes “remains high”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIndeed, though the pandemic’s spread has varied widely among countries, it was spreading swiftly in some experiencing hot weather, including Australia and parts of Iran.The new ecological analysis suggests that balmy days might aid — though not by themselves accomplish — the goal of social-distancing measures advised by public health officials.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastOther groups have sought to see if seasonal change would affect the virus that has spawned a pandemic, infecting more than 2 million people worldwide. Early this month, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences looked exclusively at humidity and temperature and found that they would have a minimal impact on the virus. The panel’s assessment contradicted popular accounts.At the White House coronavirus task force briefing Thursday evening, President Donald Trump highlighted research at the Department of Homeland Security that found that sunlight and disinfectants — including bleach and alcohol — can kill the coronavirus on surfaces in as little as 30 seconds.“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Trump said, speculating on a possible means to fight the virus.While such an idea is currently far from the realm of a safe treatment, life scientists have long been aware that the sun threatens the viability of many microorganisms.“Sunlight kills most pathogenic microbes quite rapidly,” John Postgate, a British microbiologist, wrote two decades ago in the popular book Microbes and Man, published by Cambridge University Press. The lethality, he continued, is principally the result of “the ultraviolet component of solar radiation. Ultraviolet lamps can be used indoors to sterilise the air in operating theatres and pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratories. Even in diffuse daylight there is an appreciable amount of light of the effective wavelength”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A small industry that sells ultraviolet lamps as a germicide has arisen, but experts warn of their potential dangers for humans.Many nonscientists — including Trump — have noted the seasonality of colds and flu and hoped the novel coronavirus would act likewise. Dr\u0026nbspRobert R\u0026nbspRedfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told National Public Radio last month that he, too, expected an ebb and flow of disease.“Most respiratory viruses have a seasonality to them,” he said. “It’s reasonable to hypothesise — we’ll have to wait and see — but I think many of us believe as we’re moving into the late spring, early summer season, you’re going to see the transmission decrease.”But he also pointed to the likelihood that the coronavirus would continue to be a problem in the fall, when it would coincide with the start of a new flu season.Comparative studies of viruses suggest that, as a class, coronaviruses are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet light because of their relatively large genetic codes.“The more target molecules,” one study noted, “the more likely the genome will be damaged.”Even so, other aspects of sunlight’s effects may also play important roles in whether viruses can easily infect humans — a main one being its promotion of the synthesis of vitamin D, a nutrient that can strengthen the immune system and lower the risk of certain illnesses.The Connecticut scientists, Cory Merow and Mark C. Urban,\u0026nbsptitled their paper “Seasonality and Uncertainty in Covid-19 Growth Rates”. It was posted on Wednesday on medRxiv, a preprint website for health scientists run by Yale University, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, and the company that publishes the British Medical Journal. The site notes that its preprints have not undergone peer review for accuracy and thus “should not be used to guide clinical practice.”Mr Merow said that although the lethal effects of ultraviolet light on viruses are well known, he and his colleague were surprised to find a seasonal drop evident on a global scale.Mr Merow said he and his colleague had mined existing studies on how environmental and ecological factors correlate with virus infection rates and used them in ecological modelling of the global repercussions. Global data on temperatures, humidity, the penetration through the atmosphere of sunlight’s ultraviolet rays, population ages and densities, and Covid-19 infection counts were combined into a computer model that mapped out the seasonal trends, he said.Spacecraft to examine the Sun sends back its first findingsMr Merow noted that the study’s range of uncertainty was considerable, such that, depending on the location within the United States, the chance of seeing no viral slowdown in the summer ranged from 20\u0026nbspto 40 per cent.“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” he said of the reported seasonality.Even if coronavirus cases decline in the summer as his model projects, Mr Merow said, social distancing and other health public measures would still be necessary.In some circumstances, Mr Merow noted, summer days would offer no protection at all. For instance, window glass blocks ultraviolet rays.“If everybody sits next to one another on the bus and coughs,” he said, “ultraviolet light is not going to protect you.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government will continue to challenge these views and to help communities unite.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I do four shifts a week at Felix’s Enfield depot, mostly as a driver. What amazes me is the superb quality of the food, with expensive items such as wild salmon otherwise going to waste.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance. I urge everyone who is able to support the appeal.”How to support our campaignThe Independent\u0027s appeal, in association with our sister newspaper The Evening Standard, was set up to fund The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor, to provide for the delivery of food to the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies, or are stuck at home at risk of losing their lives. Felix currently delivers the equivalent of 100,000 meals a day to giant community hubs run by local authorities as well as charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But we have to do it living with Covid’Philip Hammond says a plan to allow the economy to escape the lockdown must be published next week, because the country will be “living with Covid” for a long time.The former Conservative chancellor said Boris Johnson’s expected return to Downing Street must see him to bow to pressure to set out a blueprint for a phased return to something like normal life.“The reality is that we have to start reopening the economy.

It is then, of course, the role of Sage to advise the government.“I have been confident that what happens at Sage is a scientific discussion involving the scientists and the experts who are members of Sage.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There are no mixed messages.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room.

You have to do it.They keep us fit — or at least, far fitter than we would ever bethey weren’t compulsory walkies waiting for us at the startof every new day.I would never dream of jumping out of bed at dawnit was not for Stan, our ruby-coloured, eight-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, who is always keen to get out into the world and snf a few lampposts, greet four-legged friends and wander, blissed-out, through nature.Whatever the weather, Stan wakes up ready for his dawn yomp on London’s Hampstead Heath and, whatever my mood, Stan is sure to lt it.Because dogs are the most positive creatures on God’s earth.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealNo animal on the planet comes in so many dferent shapes and sizes and temperaments, but every dog knows how to get the maximum joy out of any given moment.Dogs have a genius for living le to the full.In these dark days, their relentlessly positive outlook is nothing less than inspirational.And you can’t help noticing that dogs rather like lockdown.With her A-levels coming up, the closure of the schools was a devastating blow for my -year-old daughter.But Stan is absolutely delighted to have her hanging around the house.Even after all these weeks, he trots after her with his tail wagging happily and a pleasantly surprised expression that says: “What are you doing here in the middle of the day ”Many of our ten million pooches must get desperately lonely home alone during the long working days of normal le.They are not lonely now, and are delighted to be our constant companions.The reason that the ,-year-old partnership between humans and dogs has worked so well is because dogs have been happy to perform whateverwe have asked of them.Guard dogs, guide dogs, snfer dogs, herding dogs, lapdogs, therapy dogs — you name it and some dog out there will do it brilliantly.And now there is research to seethey can be trained to spot coronavirus.Medical detection dogs already help screen for cancer, malaria and Parkinson’s disease.Now the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is running tests to seedogs can be trained to snf out Covid-.“We do not knowCovid- has a specic odour yet,” says Professor James Logan, head of LSHTM’s department for disease control.“But we know that other respiratory diseases change our body odour so there is a chance that it does.“Andit does, dogs will be able to detect it.”We ask a lot of our dogs.In the lockdown, we look to our four-legged friends to be the cure for loneliness.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.The Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest canine charity, reports that is has been “overwhelmed” with applications for dogs to keep the nation company during lockdown, not least for all those millions of children who are shut out of school and no longer able to see their friends.“On Sunday March  we recorded our busiest day at the contact centre since it opened in , with a  per cent increase in calls,” says a Dogs Trust spokesman. “However, like many other animal welfare charities, we have now closed all our rehoming centres.”This dog-crazy nation got even crazier about dogs during lockdown.But it is probably just as well that organisations such as the Dogs Trust and Battersea Dogs Home are currently closed.Because getting a dog should never be an impulse buy.I came downstairs this morning and discovered Stan had sprayed liquid diarrhoea all over his cage.He was mortied, not least because he knew that I was going to have to clean it up. Stan can’t do it.Nobody will ever love you like a dog.Nobody will ever be as happy to see you as a dog.Nobody will ever make you laugh as much as a dog.In their heartbreakingly brief lives they make you realise how lucky you are to be alive.I would recommend getting a dog to anyone.Watching your child grow up with a dog is a privilege and a joy.But our dogs rely on us as much as we rely on them.And a dog is for ever, not just for lockdown.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back. Dawn French will reprise her role as the Rev Geraldine Granger for the BBC’s Big Night In this evening.That should cheer us up for a few moments.Here are a few more sitcoms they could update to keep us laughing through the lockdown:Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em – Frank Spencer is appointed Health Secretary and has to give briefings every day to the Press. Ooh, Betty, the hilarity.Till Death Us Do Part – Alf Garnett, in self isolation, kindly explains to us what he thinks of some Chinese culinary practices and the Chinese government.Both Feet In The Grave – sadly, there was no ventilator for Victor.Not Going Out – huge laughs as a large number of people don’t, er, go out.Are You Being Served  – um . . .  no, actually.Dad’s Army – Captain Mainwaring orders his men to build a new hospital in two days flat, with hilarious consequences.On The Buses – Stan and Jack vow to wreak revenge on the idiots who won’t give them PPE.How’s the home- schooling coming along then Got the kids up at eight every morning to do a bit of calculus I’ve been enjoying it, although I maybe haven’t given enough attention to mathematics.But it’s been a good chance to redress some of the crap my daughter has been subjected to in ten years of state education.She now has a slightly dferent take on the British Empire, the poverty of Africa and how fun it might be to transition into being a bloke.A mad woman in America has warned that home-schooling is “dangerous”. Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn. So my we and daughter kindly agreed to cut my hair for me. They gave me a kind of Mohican.I think it’s great. The new me. Liddle, back in the game. Watch out, chicks.KIM JONG-UN is apparently very ill. Nothing to do with the coronavirus.The morbidly obese weirdo who runs North Korea is thought to be under-going serious heart surgery.He’s getting his reward then, for eating like a king while the rest of his country starves. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hairdressers will be instantly elevated to key worker status.We’ll bang pots and pans for them in the street every Thursday at pm.Before that we’re all going to have to learn to use scissors and clippers fast.If it goes wrong at least we’ll have masks to hide behind.IT’S not often we congratulate employment tribunals for their common sense.But one saw right through tech exec Rachel Power’s claim that she was sexually discriminated against by a boss who told her: “You got balls.”Everyone  knows it’s harmless slang for having guts.As for bringing a case over it . . . that really is a load of balls.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will. Never. Happen.I adore the show and am glad it is on track toas usual later this year.But I know I would be very, very bad – and not in a funny Ed Ballsy way.I’d just be embarrassingly woeful. At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Sweden, they say that everyone should rub up against one another when shopping, while in France they are ­ordering everyone to stay inside for another three weeks. Some boffins say that testing is the answer to Covid-. Some say it isn’t.Some say  is the age where you most need to worry. Some say it’s .Some say the virus will be wiped out by summer weather. Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much. And then I saw that picture of Pierce Brosnan . . .TO mark something called Earth Day , Prince Charles has said that in future we should put the “people and the planet” first.Hmmm. Not sure that’s going to work. Because what the planet wants and what people want are two very dferent things.What people want is to be warm and comfortable. We also want to be happy, which means we want a new sofa from DFS, a nice car, a couple of holidays every year and a fridge full of ice-cold beer.Charles would probably argue that the “people” he’s talking about are those who live in mud huts in Africa and Asia and bits of South America.Right. So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span.

The big ones will take longer.Or raise the seedlings indoors so the children can watch their progress. To do that, place seeds on a damp kitchen paper towel in a clean container.As soon as you see tiny roots emerge, plant them into small pots or trays of moist ­potting compost.Now they need full light and can go on to a window sill or patio table.Check regularly to see the compost does not dry out.Once they are six or more inches high they can be planted either in final containers or out in the garden.ASK children to draw a flower and they usually sketch out a sunflower – a single stem with yellow petals ­surrounding a dark central disc.Soyou’re aged under , show us your drawing skills and you could win a £ National Garden gt token.Send your colourful drawings or ­paintings to sunflowers@ the-sun by May , , and I will pick my top ten artists, who will each receive a £ token.We will also be giving away another ten vouchers for the best ­photos of your sunflowers when they start flowering this summer.Send those photographs to sunflowers@the-sun by September , .For full TCs here.BY paying attention to your garden, balcony, window sill – or even that unloved patch of ground down the road – you can unlock a host of benefits for yourself, your kids and your community.You can encourage wildle to thrive. Hedges, trees, flowers and even grass are havens for important critters, from birds and hedgehogs to frogs and beetles.You don’t need a sprawling estate to make a dference.One of the best things about sunflowers is their ability to absorb toxins. After the nuclear disasters at Hiroshima, Chernobyl and Fukushima, fields of sunflowers were planted to reduce toxic metals and radiation levels in the soil.They are also perfect for pollinating insects including bees and butterflies. And at the very end of their le they produce enough seeds to feed a flock of birds.There are plenty more simple ways we can help the environment from our gardens, too.Eating more fruit and veg and less meat is something we can all do. Tomatoes, beetroot, courgette and lettuce are easy to grow and can be sown indoors now and put on a sunny window sill to germinate. Use cardboard toilet roll tubes or egg boxes for this.Plant the seeds by following the packet instructions and keep them moist until they are ready to plant outside.Lettuce will grow just as easily indoors or on a balconyyou prick out the smaller seedlings to give the stronger ones more space.If herbs are your thing, include lemon balm. A few leaves steeped in hot water makes a fragrant tea that can help calm anxiety.Plant herbs as near to the kitchen as you can so you can grab a handful when you’re cooking.Plants and flowers provide food for nature but you can also build a home for frogs, ladybirds, beetles and other insects – it’s a great way for kids to see them up close.You don’t need anything fancy. Old bricks, bits of wood, logs, layers of cardboard, twigs, roof tiles or broken terracotta pots piled up in a semi-organised heap will do. The idea is to create lots of tiny, dferent-sized spaces for creatures to crawl into.Just be sure to put something waterproof on top to keep out the rain.You can even create a “hedgehog highway” by cutting a small hole – about the size of a CD – at the base of your fence on both sides of the garden. Encourage your neighbours to do the same, too, as hedgehogs like to roam large distances and this stops them getting penned in.If you haven’t got a garden, growing plants on your balcony or window sill can be just as beneficial for you and for nature.Andyou’re struggling for space there too, when you’re out on your daily exercise take note of unused bits of ground – around the base of street trees, on roadside verges, abandoned empty planters – that might benefit from a bit of colour.Plant your sunflower seeds there and watch them grow as you walk, run or cycle past each day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said the government cannot wait until a vaccine has been developed, in an interview on BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “The reality is that we have to start reopening the economy. But we have to do it living with Covid,” he said. “We canapost wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy wonapost survive that long.” Mr Hammond said the strategy so far of “locking everything down and keeping everything locked down is relatively straightforward”. “The challenge of how to carefully, progressively, methodically reopen, protecting both health and jobs, is much, much more challenging and calls for a really skilful political leadership,” he continued.

The Home Secretary is set to hold a press conference later today where she will produce data showing there is a rising number of people flouting the rules. For coronavirus updates, follow our live blog.  A source told the Sun: “We are seeing a worrying increase in people moving around. “We know it has been hard but everyone needs to stick with it. “The more people comply with the rules, and we slow the spread of this virus, the sooner we can think about easing rules.”The warning comes amid an increased appetite for the government to explain how the UK might eventually make its way out of lockdown. It is understood that the UK government is considering letting people socialise with nominated bubbles of people outside of their households as it plans an exit strategy. During Fridayaposs Downing Street press conference, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged people to stay at home despite apparent improvements in the crisis.

He added: We start then to see a change towards more unsettled weather as we go through Sunday and into next week, becoming a little bit cooler. On Sunday thereaposs a greater risk of showers breaking out almost anywhere really. It might be welcome rain for some, after itaposs been so dry.

Mr Cummings was one of  attendees at a key meeting of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson March , the day Boris Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown, according to a list leaked to the . Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is also understood to have been present.The revelation yesterday evening has raised signicant questions about the independence of the scientic advice given by Sage. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here A former government chief scientic adviser, Sir David King, said he was shocked to find that there were political advisers involved. If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias. That is just so critically important, he told the . A No spokesman confirmed Mr Cummings had attended Sage meetings but denied he was a member of the group. Sage provides independent scientic advice to the Government. Political advisers have no role in this, they said. The scientists on Sage are among the most eminent in their fields. It is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply their advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions. Downing Street say that Mr Cummings had attended some Sage meetings and listened to some meetings now they are all virtual. He and another adviser do this in order to understand better the scientic debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions, the spokesman added. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall.  The Government is under increasing pressure to reveal who sits on Sage given its critical role giving advice on how to tackle the coronavirus crisis. It has never released a list of the aposs members of attendees, although iniduals are free to disclose they are part of the group. In a letter to Parliament earlier this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKaposs chief scientic adviser and chair of Sage, said the group does not disclose its membership on the advice of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure . He said this is for security reasons, and to protect members from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the disclosure that Mr Cummings had been attending Sage raised signicant questions about the credibility of Government decision-making.

It is understood that the UK government is considering letting people socialise outside of their households in small bubbles as it plans an exit strategy. The move would widen the current stay at home advice to include meals and other social activities with close relatives and friends. It would also mean couples who do not live together can spend time together. However, people would only be able to nominate one or two households to be part of their cluster, and would not be able to mingle with anyone . For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It comes after Nicola Sturgeon today said the Scottish government is looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions. But the First Minister warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. The idea is also being considered by the UK Government, Mail Online reports. A Whitehall source told the paper: If we can find a way to allow a bit more flexibility without risking transmission of the disease running higher then we will do it. Similar plans are also being considered in Belgium. Scotlandaposs government has gone further than UK officials in laying out how lockdown might eventually be eased. Yesterday Ms Sturgeon published a -page document saying outdoor activities might resume, and businesses may reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The First Minister also suggested schools could reopen with modications needed in some classrooms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has refused to comment in detail on the plan for the whole of the UK. But today he said Ms Sturgeonaposs plan was essentially a reiteration of his own five tests of when lockdown can be relaxed. Those five tests are: the NHS able to cope a sustained fall in deaths infections dropping to aposmanageableapos rates adequate testing and PPE and no risk of a second peak.  Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland no decisions have been made on such a bubble arrangement. But she said she wants to have an open conversation with the public about the way forward. Ms Sturgeon said: I know from my own parents who are not seeing their grandkids just know, I understand the anguish of that. Weaposre all missing seeing our loved ones so we all want to get beyond that as quickly as possible. Every country is going through these decisions, none of us are through this pandemic yet, but some countries are starting to look at slightly expanding what people would define as their household - encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody  who is on their own or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people. She added: And the key thing there is,youaposre seeing maybe one or two more people outside your household, itaposs got to be the same people on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis so youaposre still limiting the ability for the virus to transmit. Now, none of these are fixed decisions yet, but these are all the kind of things weaposre trying to work through. What weaposre trying to do is to do is, how do we get a semblance of normality back into our lives because the lockdown - it is essential that people stick with it just now - but itaposs having consequences of its own.  The First Minister said any easing of the lockdown will be gradual and le will not be normal for some time to come. Lockdown has the potential tomultiple timesthe virus spikes again. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said the key factor in easing lockdown will be speed with which number of new cases reduces. Once lockdown is eased, the key factor in keeping it that way will be a test and trace programme.

If youaposre asked, please take part. Itaposs painless. The national randomised clinical trial will help to determineplasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-, known as convalescent plasma, is an effective treatment for patients who are severely unwell with the illness. If effective, a national programme will deliver up to , units of plasma a week to the NHS to help treat coronaviruspatients. This would provide enough plasma to treat , patients each week. Plasma from recovered COVID- patients can be transfused to patients who are struggling to produce their own antibodies against the virus. The Department of Health and Social Care is working in collaboration with NHS Blood and Transplant and the other UK blood services, Public Health England and NHS Digital to deliver the programme. Matt Hancock said: This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it. The UK has world-leading le sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.  Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future. Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: The UK is leading the world’s largest trials to find a treatment for COVID-, with over , people so far involved testing a range of medicines we hope to add convalescent plasma to this list shortly.

And the question of when and how they can open is one that will not go away.When will schools reopen There has not yet been a decision - but most agree that it canapost be before the end of May.Most in the sector agree that what is best is for pupils to be in school - but only when it’s safe for them to do so.Some in the sector are concerned that even speculating about their reopening could be a bad thing.The National Education Union have warned that “loose talks costs lives”.General Secretary Dr Mary Bousted said that the speculation “deeply concerns our members, who would be at immediate riskGovernment was too hasty in relaxing lockdown measures.”The earliest realistic point at which schools in England could start re-opening would be  June, head teachersapos leader Geoff Barton has said.We cannot see any realistic way that schools could be re-opened to more pupils before the second half of the summer term, said the ASCL leader.But even the  June date is viewed as optimistic because, in order to meet that target,Mr Barton says planning would need to begin very soon.Will they be safe This is the overriding concern of everyone involved in the decision from government to unions to school leaders and parents.  Before schools were shut last month, many were running with a skeleton staff with teachers and others off sick.While many parents kept children at home believing it was the safety place for them to be. More than , people have now signed a petition set up by the National Education Union which asks the government not to reopen them before itaposs safe and to commit to testing and tracing to help that.The new general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women TeachersDr Patrick Roach, warned that staff concerns must be fully addressed before teachers would be willing to come back.In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this week, Dr Roach demanded personal protective equipmentfor all staff, anti-viral cleaning measures and guidelines on how social distancing would be enforced in schools. Will they look dferent when they     On Thursday Nicola Sturgeon talked about “rearranging classrooms” so that the m distancing could be observed.The First Minister said alternating weeks for pupils was the type of option her government is considering whenever lockdown is eased. She also raised the prospect of redesigning classrooms as a way of enforcing social distancing. She has consistently been more open with the public about measures to deal with coronavirus suggesting the Westminster government will be having similar discussions.Sturgeon said of schools: “I think some countries have perhaps had some children in school go back.“There has been some talk, and it is certainly an option that has to be considered, although we might not do it, some kids go one week, other kids go the next week, so that there’s the ability to have smaller classes. “These are the kind of options we are dealing with.” The Welsh First Minister has also stipulated that the m rule must be observed in schools currently and in the future.For many schools that may inevitably mean a new layout for classroom and for teachers to handle fewer pupils at a time.The details have not yet been decided but they are part of the discussion which will have to happen before schools .    They want to - or certainly their unions want them to have that option.The unions representing support staff have banded together to demand their members have the right equipment before theyto work.The GMB, Unison and Unite have issued a joint statement asking the government to engage with them ahead of anyto school. They say their members need proper equipment and that staff are currently very worried. At the moment PPE provision is patchy.One school told the Mirror they have equipment to be worn when dealing with an ill child but not for other situations.But with many children potentially posing as carriers rather than suffering from the virus there are concerns that staff could be more at risk than the children they care for.Andy Prendergast, Senior Organiser for the GMB, told the Mirror: “There’s a huge number of hurdles we need to get over before schools can be open across the board. There’s the problems with PPE which are problems everywhere and at the moment we can’t get enough into hospitals and care homes so the idea that there’s tonnes of it waiting for schools is quite simply not the case.  “The relatively small number of schools that are open are struggling to get PPE, but the idea that we can open all the schools in the country and have them work safely just doesn’t work.“One of the big issues that they’ve got is lack of hand sanitiser and some of the advice being given is that people can go and wash their hands. The obvious problem with that isyou’re in a class with a load of kids and you have to go and wash your hands. That involves you having to go somewhere, having to touch numerous doors, wash your hands, go all the way back and what do the kids do in the meantime “What we’re saying very clearly is we need to have adequate risk assessments and there needs to be adequate stocks of PPE to protect the members as we move forward on that.“While there are national shortages of PPE we can’t see that happening any time soon but obviously we want to get people back to usual but to do that we need to be satisfied that members - and also the kids and their families - are going to be protected.”“We’ve had at least one member who works in a school who has died of covid- and, while we can’t say for absolute certain how they got the virus, we are extremely concerned that that may have been spread through the school. At the moment the they’re not being forced back to work and the government lockdown continues for the next few weeks but the concern is what happens after that.Will teachers be tested  If they show symptoms anyone who works in a school will be eligible for a test as a key worker as part of the announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock of the extension of the governmentaposs testing programme. They need to sign up or be referred by their manager on gov.ukThe newly-unveiled system has suffered teething problems as the government struggled to cope with demand. Some , of the test at home kits were ordered within two minutes of an online portal opening for million key workers and their families. A further , testing slots at drive-through testing sites were taken on Friday - forcing the government to close the entire self-testing website for the day.But it is expected to be back up and running from am on Saturday.

DIY giant BQ reopened more than  stores this weekend, despite the majority of high street chains keeping their doors shut. BQ has been closed since the end of March although customers have been able to use click and collect services to purchase goods. Hardware stores have been classed as ‘essential’ during the coronavirus crisis, but some fear more stores reopening may cause people to flout lockdown restrictions and go on non-essential journeys. One carer from York said she had “never seen anything like it” after visiting her local branch to pick up new light bulbs for a -year-old lady she looks after. She said she saw shoppers leaving the stores with barbecues and gardening items. Tracey Sharp, , told Yorkshire Live: The queues have been round the car park. Itaposs just crazy. Iaposve never seen anything like it. I go past every single day and itaposs just packed whatever time of the day.Yesterday it was all round the car park. That was at am and again at am. A video filmed by Tracey at am today shows the extent of queues outside the store in Hull Road. Itaposs not quite as bad as yesterday, but people are still going crazy because itaposs gardening season and the weather is nice, she said.Iaposve been here  minutes, but I reckon it will take me an hour and a half to get in. There are about  people here. The queue is just getting longer and longer. Not all sections of BQ stores have fully reopened including kitchen and bathroom design, paint mixing and timber and key cutting. The chain has introduced a number of changes to help shoppers adhere to social distancing guidelines, which includes limiting the number of customers in the stores at any one time and installing screens at checkouts.  However Health Secretary Matt Hancock said hardware stores such as BQ were “never required to close in the first place”.

A police officer caught the couple flouting lockdown restrictions on a patrol – and they were found to be driving without insurance and a driving licence.The car was seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and the tourists were issued with two fixed penalty notices, reports Cornwall Live. Police were given powers at the end of March to issue fines to those caught flouting stay-at-home rules. People can end up in courtthe fines are unpaid.  The measures were put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus and make sure people only take essential journeys. The probation PC, who tweets as The Hungry Copper, took to Twitter to share the incident.The tweet read: “Found  people sleeping in a car in #Falmouth Checked their details  both live in #Kent  had driven down for a mini break. But driver had No Insurance  No Driving Licence! Car seized   #FixedPenaltyNotices issued for Breaching the #Covid_ #lockdown #restrictions #StayHome” People have been quick to praise the officer online. One user said: “Absolutely remarkable! Selfishness at its worst and policing at its best. Keep up the good work.” Another said: “Well done for finding these irresponsible idiots. Hope they enjoyed the long walk home.” Others questioned how the couple would be able to make it home without a car, thoughthey had no licence it would be illegal for them to drive home. Another added: “Great these people should be stopped! A mini break are they for real  What happens to them now though  Where do they stay ” This is the latest in a string of incidents, which have seen Brits flout lockdown restrictions.Over the Easter weekend more than  people were fined – which includes one person who drove hundreds of miles to collect an eBay purchase."},{"url":null,"title":"dad felt like breathing through","story":"NewsDad felt like he was breathing through straw before -days on coronavirus ventilatorRobbie Purdie, , was working as a supply teacher when he contracted COVID-.

Robbie was working as a supply teacher when he tested positive for COVID- on March . He said: “I’d had a bit of a cough but I became cold and shivery so went home from work.“I suspected it might have been coronavirus so Fiona went to pick up our son from university and our family went into self-isolation for two weeks. “I had horrendous headaches and felt absolutely shattered.“By March , it felt like I was trying to breathe through a straw. My we kept insisting we call for help but I was holding off. “She eventually phoned  and an ambulance was sent for me. I had tests and X-rays at DGRI and was diagnosed with viral pneumonia.” Robbieaposs condition was so bad that medics sedated him before putting him on a ventilator. He added: “I obviously didn’t know what was going on but my we, kids, family and friends had to live through it. “The staff kept Fiona fully informed and nurses and consultants called her frequently to let her know what was going on. “They even sent the family video clips of me when I was unable to contact them myself, which was a real comfort to them.” After improving enough to be taken off the ventilator on April , Robbie could only walk three feet using a zimmer frame and was so weak he could barely speak or write.  But after being discharged home last Monday, he is slowly building up his strength again. Robbie, from Dumfries, said: “It was wonderful to get home. I received the best care in hospital and there’s no doubt the staff saved my le. There was always somebody constantly with me. “Every single member of staff at DGRI was nothing less than utterly professional in every way and all cared for me asI was a relative. “My family and I can never thank them enough for pulling me through this awful illness and getting me back home to my family. “I want to pay tribute to those who planned my course of treatment, delivered it and saw me through the other side. “It’s strange though: because they were obviously wearing gowns and face masks,I walked past them in the street, I wouldn’t recognise them to thank them.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMany of us have given our homes a spring clean in recent weeks, purged our sock ­drawers and spice racks – but the medicine cabinet ­rarely gets a look-in. Most of us only ever think about it when we’ve sliced open a finger or our head is ­pounding but it’s ­important to declutter medical supplies each year. An annual ­review of ­prescriptions, over-the-counter ­medicines and bits and pieces such as plasters will make sure you’re fully equipped – and could even save your le. Using an old product won’t necessarily land you in hospital, but it won’t work effectively, either. Where you keep your pills and potions matters, too. Here, Sultan “Sid” Dajani, community ­pharmacist and former treasurer of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, reveals what you need at home and how to store it safely. First aid Everyone needs a decent first aid kit, separate from the medicine cabinet. It should include plasters, bandages, antiseptic wipes to clean wounds and eye wash solution to remove dirt or grit. It needs sterile dressings for when you need to sort a wound at home or on the way to hospital, as well as medical tape to help hold it in place. A thermometer and tweezers for splinters are also a wise choice.  If you use anything, replace it as soon as possible to keep your kit well-stocked. It is also a good idea to have a separate, smaller, first-aid kit in your car for any emergencies as well. Always keep your medication in its packet. The box will feature the directions for use, exactly what is inside and the expiry dates. Sometimes, blister packs are too small for expiration dates, making the packets vital for safety. Medications that are not stored properly or safely will go out of date faster soyou are in any doubt, put it in a pile – somewhere safe, where children cannot get hold of it – to take to the pharmacy, where it can be safely binned. Location Where you keep your cabinet or box is crucial – and bathrooms are not the smartest choice. If it is too warm or humid, then you’ve got a problem. Kitchen cupboards, a utility room with a tumble dryer, on top of the fridge or in direct sunlight are also no-nos. Steam and hot water can get through plastic, even in a packet or box, and medication affected by humidity or heat can become useless. Either that or it can turn more potent and even toxic. It can also put the lives of your family at risk for instance, asthma or epilepsy medication that no longer works or slow-release medication that speeds up and gives you an overdose.  The best place to keep your medication is actually on top of a bedroom wardrobe or shelf in the lounge – preferably in a locked box, out of reach from children. Tell-tale signs your medicine has been affected include capsules sticking together orthey look dferent from each other because colours have run. Checktablets have gone sticky and slimy, or powdery. Also look for any liquids that have leaked. These items should be disposed of. Good to know: Out-of-date aspirin smells like vinegar. Basics If the rush for paracetamol and Calpol has taught us anything, it is to stock up on the basics. These include over-the-counter painkillers for adults and kids, plasters, antihistamine tablets and creams – great for allergies, hay fever, insect bites and nettle stings – medication for heartburn and anti-diarrhoea and rehydration salts.  You never plan to have food poisoning from a dodgy takeaway and you do not want to be caught short. But having too much of any medication is a waste of money as it will probably go off before you can use it all. It is wise to have ViraSoothe or anaesthetic creams as they work faster on stings and bites compared to antihistamine tablets. The cream is good for cuts before you dress them. Some people keep sleeping tablets on standby too, but they may leave you feeling drowsy the next day. Dragonfly CBD oil is non-drowsy and effective. Use-by dates Check every item’s expiry date once a year and remove anything that is out of date as it may not work. It is also important to dispose of any medication that is not in its original packet. While you may know what they are, others might not and take the wrong thing – or wrong dose – by mistake. DONaposT throw these products in the bin, wash them down the sink or flush them away as they can get in to the water supply.  Take them to a pharmacy in a sealed bag to dispose of responsibly. Or, while sticking to social-distancing rules, package old medicines into small bags and post them through the pharmacy’s letter box with a note attached on each that says it is old medication. Get Organised Keep your medicine cabinet well organised so you can easily see any important  over-the-counter or prescription drugs you will soon need more of.

The government guidelines are very clear - stay home and stay safe and protect the NHS. People should only be going out for the essentials, for one form of exercise a day and for workthey cannot work from home. But police forces across the UK have found some breaching lockdown rules for frivolous and infuriating reasons. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here  Driving  miles to get a burger In Normanton, Derby, a group of four men from Burton in Staffordshire were caught by police making a -mile round trip to collect a takeaway burger. The men had travelled from the town and were caught by police on Monday, Derbyshire Live report. The men were fined £ each for breaching lockdown rules as police declared the incident an example of unnecessary travel. SkateboardingPolice in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, took to Twitter to urge skateboarders to stop using skate parks.In a series of tweets, neighbourhood officers responsible for community policing in that area, said: Skateboard England, the governing body for skateboarding in England and Wales, has a statement on their homepage that confirms all skateparks are closed and should not be used.  Our officers in Barnsley West neighbourhood team are aware that concerns have been raised about the use of the skate park at Dearne Valley Park, on Pontefract Road.

Beach parties In Wales, police are increasing patrols around the Llanelli beach and North Dock area after a group of  to  teenagers were found having a beach party.

These included driving from Essex to Chichester to collect a bonsai tree, driving from London to take photos of the stars at Beachy Head and visiting a friend who is in self-isolation because of coronavirus symptoms. In a statement, Temporary Chief Inspector Simon Burroughs said: “Please take a moment to think about the impact your actions during the coronavirus crisis are having on public health.” Taking a selfie Earlier this week, a couple were caught breaching lockdown rules by driving  miles to take a selfie at a well-known Staffordshire beauty spot.The couple were seen taking a  picture at The Roaches, a rocky ridge near Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire, having travelled more than  miles from Nottingham.When approached by officers, the couple admitted their mistake and police reminded them of the rules about travelling during the lockdown but did not hand them a fine.

PCSO Jamie Gutberlet, who was part of the patrol team who made the discovery, said: During patrols across rural areas we found a number of vehicles parked up a lot of them were not local.

A force spokesperson said: “Officers attended a property on Montford Avenue in Glasgow shortly after .pm on Sunday, April  following a report of a disturbance. “A woman, , was arrested in connection with the incident. “Additionally, two men were issued with warnings.”  Bolt cutters used to enter park Bolt cutters were used to cut chains around the entrance to the tennis courts and outdoor gym at in Uttoxeter.

She was one of four neighbours from Cumbria who scooped a share of £k playing People’s Postcode Lottery. And the surprise windfall, delivered on the  March, came on the very day she was due to welcome her two new bundles of joy into the world. Thrilled Caroline said: This year, we’ve been very lucky, it’s amazing. It’s also quite weird how our prize arrived on our twins’ original due date. I think we’ll use the money first to go on holiday, maybe two, somewhere like the Canaries so not too far for the kids.  I’m so happy we started playing People’s Postcode Lottery a few years ago. It’s a mix of a feel-good factor knowing you’re helping charities by playing and that there’s a chance of winning yourself – it’s double awesome! Caroline’s partner, Paul, added: It doesn’t seem real, but it is. It does mean a lot of arguing about who gets to spend the money though! We’ve only been in this home for six months and the cellar needs dug out and the outbuilding is needing done up. This will help us a lot to get that going.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Judie McCourt, visited Caroline and Paul to give them their prize in person. Judie said: “Handing over the golden envelope to Caroline and Paul on what was their twins’ original due date, was utterly heart-warming.

The clip was captured by vigilante group Confronted  Caught before being handed to police to ensure Phillip Hobson was jailed for his crimes. The film, which was live-streamed on Facebook, shows the -year-old - who has previous convictions for abuse crimes – being quizzed by the hunters on his vile online sex chats with an apos-year-old girlapos called Milly. Hobson, from Hanley, had believed he was communicating with a schoolgirl when he asked for naked photos and suggested meeting up in Blackpool for sex. But, the ‘girl’ was a decoy named Shay who arranged for ‘Milly’ to meet Hobson at McDonald’s in Longton, in Stoke-on-Trent, where he was arrested. The -minute clip sees the hunters arriving at the scene before spotting Hobson as he climbs out of his car. The defendant can then be seen trying to make a hasty exit as he mutters aposno, no, noapos before he is stopped from leaving and told aposnot to make a fussapos. The camera is then shone in his face as a man explains why he is going to be arrested for the online grooming of children. Hobson is repeatedly told to calm down and to keep still as he is told his rights. He repeatedly denies being involved in child abuse, saying: I donapost know what youaposre on about. Iaposm not pretending, I donapost know anyone in Blackpool. But the jobless pervert finally admits that he is a re-offender, saying: I was caught last year I think. When asked why he commits his crimes he simply shakes his head and says: I donapost know. Nobodyaposs given me help. Iaposve asked for help, but nobodyaposs given it to me. A crowd then gathers as a woman hunter tells him: Youaposre vile, youaposre a predator, youaposre a paedophile, youaposre a nonce. Youaposre a danger to children.  People like you Phillip donapost just talk to one child. How dare you target children, innocent children. “Whataposs even worse is that you donapost have any backbone to explain yourself or take on board any ownership. As Hobson repeatedly blows his nose and fights back tears, a man adds: Iaposve got all your texts on my phone. Iaposve got all the evidence. Iaposve been reading your texts that youaposve been sending to the decoys for the last two weeks. Iaposve read every single message that youaposve sent. Youaposre a big liar and a prolic paedophile, a third time reoffender.You obviously havenapost learned your lesson. You are disgusting and you are danger to society. You are the lowest piece of s*** that Iaposve ever met to be honest. You think youaposre clever, but youaposre not. I hope that this time they lock you up for a bit longer. Youaposre just lucky that the system is so pathetic that you get pathetic sentences. All you are is a weak imbecile. The footage ends as Hobson is told that the police have arrived before the hunters leave the scene on February . Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Hobson met ‘Milly’ on social networking site Hi before moving on to WhatsApp. Her profile said she was , but ‘she’ soon revealed she was only . He went on to plead guilty to attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child, attempting to meet a child after grooming and breaching a sexual harm prevention order.

Tonka and Little P were hiking and exploring in Colorado, in the US, with their devoted dad Kris Busching when they all got lost and spent three days without food or drink. Kris spotted a creek with water in a canyon below, but during the descent lost his footing and plummeted to the bottom as he tried to pull his precious pit bulls to safety. Tragically the -year-old died upon impact, while Tonka suffered a broken leg and Little P sustained a broken jaw. The pooches refused to leave Krisapos body and were found a day later by search and rescue helicopters.  They were taken to Kris’ devastated family in Long Island, New York, where nonprofit animal shelter organisation Mr. Bones  Co. stepped in and rushed the pups to an emergency vet.It was here where the doggy brothers “who lost their world suddenly” were photographed comforting each other and sweetly touching noses as they deal with the pain of their injuries and their grief.  The animal charity shared the photo with the caption: The level of loyalty and love that radiated from these two as big brother Tonka was admitted to our emergency animal hospital so that his leg could be saved needs no further caption. His bond with Little P is forever. The dogs have undergone numerous treatments, been given lots of TLC and are now on the path to recovery. But the pair have a gaping hole in their lives as they come to terms with never seeing their adored owner again.  Kris, a talented tattoo artist, took them on amazing adventures and gave them an incredible le. His brother Dave paid tribute and said: “We are all devastated, and really can’t describe the void and pain that we all feel. “He was a talented human, with huge hopes and dreams. He lived an extreme lestyle, and like most in my family, loved the outdoors. He was where he loved to be when he passed.  Dave added: Nothing, no one prepares you for something like this.” The animal charity has vowed to find the pair a new home together so they are not separated as Krisapos family heartbreakingly cannot look after them. They are currently at two dferent foster homes as they recover. Tonka has undergone several surgeries to his legs with the care team going out of their way to make sure he feels the love during this very confusing time for him.  The animal shelter organisation added: He’s been able to hang out with the doctors and nurses behind the scenes and soak up a ton of TLC. He’s eating well and coping with his splints politely. His temperament is beautul and soulful, a testimony to level of love his dad gave him for almost ten years before he passed. To honor Tonka’s dad and his remarkable artistic talent, the in-house team of bandage artists made sure Tonka had some apostattoosapos of his own and it made our day, so we wanted to share these photos with all of you.  Tonka has since been discharged from the hospital. In an update on Little P, they said: His surgery to wire and splint his broken jaw was successful and he’s looking forward to leaving the hospital today with his foster mama! After an almost immediate attempt to play and get rowdy, our decision to not foster them together was further reinforced. Now that Little P also has a strict recovery period he needs to get through, it is imperative that both dogs continue to temporarily foster separately. This brief separation will be a blip on the radar when they are recovered and have found their new home together!  They continued: For Little P to have suffered such a severe break, whatever his head hit on the fall down the canyon hit with such force that he had little chance of surviving, and yet, he did. As long as this fighter keeps everything except kibble out of his mouth for six weeks he will heal and undergo one more outpatient surgery to remove the splint and wiring and our silly little ping pong ball will be back at play!A fundraising page has also been set up to help Krisapos family financially and has raised more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror leaked document adds","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Leaked document adds weight to calls for Covid- inquiryA leaked document shows the Cabinet Office was warned that it needed to step up preparations for a pandemic, adding weight to calls for a public inquiry into the Governments handling of the outbreakShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR NewsopinionA leaked document is adding more pressure on the Government to hold an inquiry \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Ministers will argue that it is impossible to plan for every unexpected event. But a leaked document reveals the Cabinet Office was warned last year that it needed to step up its preparations for a pandemic. In particular, the risk assessment set out the importance of ensuring there was sufficient personal protective equipment, the capacity to carry out testing and tracing and an action plan to help Brits overseas get home. These are three of the areas where the Government has fallen short. At some point ministers need to explain who saw this advice and who was responsible for implementing its recommendations. This document adds even more weight to the case for a public inquiry, when the crisis is over, into the Government’s handling of it. Dismal Donald Donald Trump may be regarded as a joke by most of the world but in America he still has a base of loyal supporters. This loyalty is why his uninformed suggestion that disinfectant could treat coronavirus is so dangerous.  There are already enough bogus remedies on the internet without the President adding his own potentially deadly advice. Trump dismissed the outbreak as a hoax before claiming it would be over by Easter. He has put the lives of Americans at risk by encouraging quack remedies and urging his followers to defy the lockdown.

This caused a lot of chaos as a number of sheep escaped and ended up getting rather lost for seven years. Over time they were forgotten about by their owners.

And now she has ed home, much to Aliceaposs surprise - although sheaposs not looking quite so little anymore.Prickles is sporting a gigantic woolly coat, which is set to be shorn off for charity, with her owners organising a aposguess the weight of her fleeceapos competition to raise funds, with the proceeds going to help refugees suffering amid the coronavirus crisis.

He was born in Ceres Hospital, around  miles northwest of the city of Santa Fe in central-eastern Argentina on Wednesday. The move has upset workers at the Ceres Hospital, who originally thought it was a joke. One worker told local paper El Litoral: “I’m saddened this has happened, especially at our hospital. “I think it’s a total lack of respect for the people who have died from this virus. “At first I thought it was a joke but when I saw it had been certied by the hospital I realised it was true. “It’s pretty off. Sadly this is going to be world news and the Ceres Hospital stamp is going to be on it.” But hospital director Silvana Torres said the name was the parents’ decision and not something she was questioning. The baby’s grandmother Alicia Jauregui said the name came out of a conversation between his parents saying their child was going to be famous because he arrived at a dficult time and that was going to make him a “strong little man.” The baby was born by C-section weighing just over lbs. Alicia told a local journalist: “I’m so happy, he’s my th grandchild. “It was beautul to see him for the first time. He’s just like his dad when he was born.” The killer virus also inspired a couple in India who gave birth to twins.

The global health emergency has led to shops around the world being stripped bare of essential items such as pasta, toilet roll and flour. But sales of gum and mints have dropped, suggesting that social distancing measures mean shoppers are worrying less about keeping their breath smelling fresh, news.au reports. The Australian supermarket chain Coles says demand for both of these items has fallen since the Government introduced lockdown measures to slow the spread of Covid-. However, a spokeswoman says its shops have been doing a healthy trade in items which can ease the boredom of le at home, such as coffee capsules, baking items and hair dye. “Last month as people prepared for an extended period of isolation, we saw great demand for pantry staples, such as flour, pasta and tinned vegetables,” she said. “We are now seeing customers move towards products that they can use at home including hair colourants, baking mixes, gt cards for online entertainment, stationery and coffee capsules. “As customers increasingly work from home we are seeing less demand for packaged salads, while social distancing has led to a downturn in sales of gums and mints, as well as for cinema and restaurant gt cards.” The grocery chain has now lted restrictions on items such as fresh milk and meat, which were brought in after mass panic-buying last month as Covid- swept across the globe. But although stock levels of many previously in-demand products are beginning toto normal, shortages of flour are still being reported. A rise in home baking has led to a surge in sales, despite Coles limiting customers to two packets of flour per purchase. In the UK, supermarket prices on aposessentialapos items have risen by an eye-watering % in the past month, with pet food, rice and vegetables seeing the biggest jump. The data, published by the Office for National Statistics , shows the early signs of rising living costs that households face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It shows how supply and demand has already resulted in a sharp increase in daily prices - in as little as four weeks.

Jeni Bonell is a mum-of- and usually spends £ on her weekly shop, which includes  rolls of toilet paper and  litres of milk. Although she is picking up the same items as usual, Jeni, from Queensland, Australia, says other customers often mumble and give her accusing looks during her shop during the coronavirus pandemic. Shopping for all her children, who are aged between four and , Jeni decided to let her fellow shoppers know exactly why she was buying so much food. She wrote a sign which she sticks to her trolley for all to see, which reads: Not hoarding, just feeding  kids. Be kind or go away please.Jeni told The Sun she was forced to use the message after shopping rules were introduced, which included limiting the time people could spend in supermarkets She said: This pandemic has brought out the best and worst of people. And unfortunately because we have to always buy large amounts of food due to our family size, people can still be rude in the grocery store. She added: Mainly we just get the judgey looks and the mumbling under their breath as they walk past.

The WHO said the practice could actually increase the risks of continued spread, as people who have recovered may ignore advice about taking standard precautions against the virus. The health agency said: Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-, the virus that causes COVID-, could serve as the basis for an aposimmunity passportapos or aposrisk-free certicateapos that would enable iniduals to travel or toto work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID- and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. The WHO said they are continuing to review the evidence on antibody responses to the coronavirus - adding that most studies show that people who have recovered from the infection have antibodies. However, the health agency added that at this point in the pandemic there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certicate”. It comes as the first human trials for a coronavirus vaccine in the UK began this week.Researchers at the University of Oxford have been working frantically to develop a possible vaccine in a short period. The trial, which started on Thursday, will be split into three main phases. Phase  will involve  healthy participants, aged  to , who will either receive the ChAdOx nCoV- vaccine or a control injection for comparison. If Phase  goes well, Phase  will then extend the maximum age of trial participants to - years, then over . Finally, Phase  will see , volunteers aged over  years tested, with half receiving the COVID- vaccine.  The researchers at Oxford’s Jenner Institute explained: “Clear efficacy endpoints will be used to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine, and volunteers from phase I and II will be included in the follow-up.” It is now known yet when the vaccine will be available to the public. John Bell, a researcher working on the project, explained: “[The question is] will it protect people, and that has not been tested and it will only be tested once you have vaccinated a signicant number of people and exposed them to the virus and counted how many people have got the virus in that population.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Aberdeen Running Club chairman Tom Brian is one of the driving forces behind the idea.He said: “As a club we are very keen to see a marathon back in Aberdeen.“It has been a long time since we had one here and I’m sure there’s a demand for it.“Whether that happens remains to be seen, but there is definitely a case for it.”Aberdeen and the north-east can justiably claim to be the spiritual home of Scottish marathon running.The first amateur race over the now traditional distance of  miles and  yards was held on a course between Fyvie Castle and the city  years ago this weekend.Glasgow’s Dunky Wright, who would go on to become one of Scotland’s greatest distance runners, won the inaugural event by a narrow margin from Aberdeen’s Jim Ronaldson on April  .Contemporary reports described how local athletics officials wanted to hold a “proper” marathon in the hope it would “reveal obscure talent capable of representing Great Britain at the following year’s Olympic Games in Paris”.Wright was hardly an obscure talent at this time, but he was inexperienced at marathon running.By the spring of  he had won his first national cross-country title and had competed in the international cross-country championships for a fourth successive year. But his best years were still to come.The conditions for Wright’s debut were hardly ideal. A strong, bitingly cold headwind faced the starting line-up of  runners.To make matters worse, the heavy rain in the days leading up to the race left the unsurfaced rural Aberdeenshire roads caked in slippery mud.The Glasgow man got off to a fast start and led his closest challenger by more than a minute after three miles and held a two-minute advantage by mile eight.It was not, however, to be all plain sailing, as Wright recalled more than  years later in a fascinating interview with Olympic marathon runner Donald Macgregor.He said: “At  miles I said to an official at a feeding station that I’d like some brandy and tea. ‘Sorry’ he replied, ‘we don’t have any tea. So I had three noggins of brandy and ran on.”Wright began to wobble in the closing miles, caused perhaps by the brandy – or just as likely by simply running out of fuel.He was fortunate not to be caught by Aberdeen’s Ronaldson who closed to within m.Wright held on, however, to cross the line first in hr min .sec.He would go on to compete in three Olympic marathons, his best result coming in  when he finished fourth after having led at  miles.He also won the  Empire Games marathon and was third in .The Aberdeen marathon subsequently fell by the wayside but was re-established in  by Aberdeen AAC’s former Scotland international runner Mel Edwards.The new race was initially held over a four-lap course at Bridge of Don, but later moved to take in parts of the city centre, the beach and Deeside.It soon developed to include a regular home countries international match and hosted the Scottish championships on a number of occasions.A peak of , runners took part, in , but a subsequent drop in numbers combined with a preference for K running brought about the demise of the race in .The centenary of the Fyvie to Aberdeen race is now only three years away and that presents a unique opportunity for the north-east to capitalise on this historic sporting landmark.Brian hopes something might happen before that, but whatever the timescale he remains committed to pursuing the idea.He said: #I had heard about the  race and it offers a tremendous marketing opportunity.“I know a lot of people are excited by the idea so let’s hope we can make something happen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time.

In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver. But these exciting plans looked to be scuppered with the imposition of lockdown.Thankfully, though, postman Keith Borthwick came to the rescue, explained Lisa.She says: \"He made sure that every house received a copy of the newsletter with their mail. Feedback has been brilliant. Itrsquos proving a great resource to help people access local shops.The village has also created a highly productive WhatsApp group, which is proving to be a \"great way\" to keep in touch with residents in isolation, says local volunteer Sonia Kelly.ldquoShoppers message when theyrsquore heading out, and those in need then get in contact,\" says Sonia. \"The system works well and is based on being neighbourly. Therersquos so much community activity taking place, itrsquos bringing everyone together in the most resourceful way.Jane McNeil is also one of Newsteadrsquos busy shoppers. ldquoI started volunteering because I wanted to help those who had made me feel welcome since moving to the village,\" she says.\"It started with a couple of neighbours and has grown since then. Irsquom a great believer in treating others as I would hope to be treated. With so many new friendships being forged, my hope is that after the pandemic, we can maintain this level of care for our neighbours.Another shopper is Jackie Kerr, who helps out a couple of the villages older residents. ldquoI shop a few times a week for Nancy Howieson, who is , and her mother Georgina Paterson ndash who recently celebrated her th birthday. They live separately and are usually very independent. So, itrsquos a dficult time for them now, but Irsquom happy to help in any way I can.Nancy and Georgina are well known around Melrose, where they founded Tweedbank Art Club and put on regular shows. ldquoWe love to paint, says Nancy. ldquoWe are the best of friends and usually see each other every day. Mum has led an exciting le including travelling the world and being a maid at Buckingham Palace for Princess Alice. Shersquos a bit fed up as she likes to get out but is still managing to paint.Whilst her mother continues to paint her way through the lockdown, Nancy has been busy tackling her garden. ldquoI try not to bother folk, but my next-door neighbour has been such a help offering to cut my grass and digging out some tree roots. Everyone in the village is being really friendly.With so many currently living in isolation, volunteers are also reaching out by phone. ldquoIf people arenrsquot on the Internet, itrsquos easy for them to be left out, says Liz Ellis, who has lived in Newstead for  years. ldquoTherefore a few of us are making regular phone calls to people all over the village just to say hello, seethey need anything and have a friendly chat. Irsquove never experienced anything like this in Newstead before. I canrsquot get over the amount of support being offered everyone is desperate to help each other.,params: .pushThe Neate family are also playing their role in raising village spirits. Toby, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother Rueben, along with other Newstead children, have been displaying colourful paintings in their windows and have decorated the village phone box with rainbows. ldquoIt makes us really happy that our art is helping to keep the village smiling, says Toby.Meanwhile, dad Tristan, who manages Neate Maintenance, has offered to help Newsteadrsquos army of NHS workers. ldquoThe pandemic is putting pressure on many key workers who are working extremely long hours. Im sure they have little time for gardening right now. In , Irsquod like to thank them by volunteering to their cut grass or do some weeding.Lisa, the resilience co-ordinator, says shes \"never felt prouder\" of the village.ldquoCoordinating the resilience group is a pleasure,\" she says. \"Wersquore seeing so many incredible acts of kindness, often between complete strangers.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

The Scottish Government has already committed to enrolling at least  senior officials to the Climate Solutions course.The news comes just days before Tuesdayrsquos one-year anniversary of Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declaring a climate emergency.The course was devised by experts at the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society in partnership with the Institute of Directors, Stirling Universityrsquos Business School and the University of Edinburghrsquos Centre for Carbon Innovation.Among the main areas the course looks at are issues around transport, energy use, supply chains, social behaviours, mitigation and planning for the future.Former UN executive secretary on climate change Christiana Figueres who brokered the Paris Agreement, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who is now UN special envoy on climate action and finance and ex Irish President Mary Robinson who set up a climate justice foundation, are among heavyweight names lending their support.The man behind the idea, RSGS chief executive Mike Robinson, said a number of business leaders have already committed to undertake the course along with the Scottish Government, with further discussions to ensure new university students and MSPs can take part well-underway.The studies are aimed at filling the gaps in knowledge, on a scientic and factual basis, with a focus on developing a structured plan. Online modules are live now, with the first planned workshop to be held in June.He insists business leaders ndash and the farming community in particular ndash will play a key role in deciding future outcomes.Mr Robinson, said: ldquoWhat wersquore really hoping is we can make it universal.ldquoThe conversations Irsquove had are with six universities is about making it mandatory for students as a matriculation course. Stirling and Edinburgh universities are already further down the line on that than others.ldquoIrsquom also talking to others about making it as mandatory as we can in all other sectors - including business - because we need everybody to wake up a bit to their responsibilities.ldquoThe Scottish Government are already committed through their programme of government to put through  senior staff on it.Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, setting a legally binding pledge to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by  at the latest ndash five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.The nationrsquos emissions cuts in March stood at around  per cent since  baseline levels, but achieving  per cent is expected to take a lot more work across every sector of the community.Speaking during Climate Solutions Week, Mr Robinson added: Targets, particularly on climate change, relate to the whole of our society and not just government, and you need businesses, you need local authorities, you need inidual actors to pick up the baton and play their role.ldquoUntil you all have the same thing you are working too, then the danger is you are actually pulling apart instead of pulling in the same direction and thatrsquos actually the single biggest risk.ldquoThere is a willingness, but not necessarily clarity.ldquoSo, herersquos a way thatrsquos credible, reliable, makes sense to business and helps them implement stuff - becauseyou donrsquot know this stuff how are you going to run a business in ten years time.Anticipating hundreds of people to enrol in the first year, he hopes the course can help reduce the impact of the pause.He said: ldquoItrsquos very solutions focussed, its imbued with optimism which I think is essential from a mental health point of view.

for the Scottish Government to take a dferent approach to that of England, Wales and Northern Ireland unless the outbreak pattern dfers greatly than where.His comments to the Westminster science and technology committee yesterday come after Nicola Sturgeon published a -page framework document which sets out how Scotland could lt lockdown measures.Stressing it was a high-level plan, the First Minister acknowledged that lting the lockdown was not ldquolike the flick of a switch and said ldquoato normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future.:Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon: Lockdown exit will be more challenging for police enforcementHowever it prompted calls for UK health secretary Matt Hancock to publish a similar document showing what measures may be taken to lt the lockdown where, while he insisted the Scottish Government plan was the same as his own five measures set out two weeks ago.Speaking to the committee by video yesterday afternoon Mr Smith and the CMOs from Wales and Northern Ireland were asked by SNP MP Pete Wishart whether they should follow an independent route out of lockdown.The MP said: ldquoAs we start to think about coming out of lockdown, surely it would be practical for the four nations to determine their own approach to that given that each nation is in a dferent place on the curve and there is a disparity in the severity across all the nations of the United Kingdom.Mr Smith replied that ldquothe science is the science no matter which part of the United Kingdom yoursquore in. ldquoHe said that it was important to maintain a consistent message across the country, so people did not become confused.:Former Watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood dies at The CMO added: ldquoThere will be dferent stages to the epidemic in the UK but there is a value in making sure the messaging to the public [is consistent], so the measures are applied with consistency, and we see the right level of compliance form the public.ldquoOnce you start to develop a mixed message there is always a risk that people will misunderstand the message, and wont know in one part of the country what they are supposed to do compared to another.Mr Smith explained that it is possible to take a dferent approach, but said ldquoWe should just be very confident that it is the right thing to do at that point in time.He said there had been a few times where Scotland had taken ldquoa nuanced approach, such as cancelling large gatherings before the rest of the UK, and said: ldquoIf that applies on the way in to the measures, it equally applies to the way out of the measures, however I would emphasise again there would need to be very good reason to make sure that was absolutely necessary.ldquoThe dferences might be that the stage of the epidemic was so wildly dferent in Scotland than in the rest of the country that there was a need to take a dferent approach, or the alternative is the approach taken in other parts of the UK was so dferent that it wouldnrsquot be right for Scotland. then we would apply the scientic evidence through the Scottish context, so we can give the right advice to our ministers.It also emerged at the committee that the devolved administrationsrsquo CMOs were not consulted before Westminster announced the roll out of an online portal to expand testing for key workers on Thursday night.The UK Governmentrsquos website for tests was overwhelmed during its first two minutes of operation yesterday when all  home testing kits were ordered by eager members of the public.The authorities later apologised after the site stopped taking bookings due to the unprecedented demand.When Welsh CMO Dr Frank Atherton was asked by an MP whether the decision to launch the online portal was something which was ldquorun past him, he responded that while the four CMOs had been working well together and sharing information, some issues remained with administrations working together.He explained: ldquoI think we should distinguish between the sharing of science and understanding, and the sharing of policy.:New Holyrood laws to make stirring up racist and homophobic hate a crimeldquoSome of the areas like that portal were really not discussed in detail across the four nations.There have been occasions where we would have liked it a little earlier notication of some of the practical details.Meanwhile, committee members quizzed English CMO Chris Whitty on why minutes from the governmentrsquos scientic advisory group for emergencieshad not been published for more than a month, and why membership of the group was being kept secret.Committee chairman Greg Clark MP said it would boost confidence to know who was in Sage and what evidence they were using, ldquoin keeping with the tradition of science of robust scrutiny and openness.Mr Clark suggested a similar model to the Scottish Governmentrsquos scientic advisory group, which publishes its minutes and membership details, would be welcome.Professor Whitty said he agreed ldquo in principle that the details should be made public, but added: ldquoWe were given quite clear advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure basically based on the fact that Sage e is a sub-committee of Cobra and meets under a range of circumstances, some of which are very security-related, this is not...The idea that itrsquos secret I think is rather strong.

While the vast majority of the public has taken a mature approach to the restrictions placed upon them, there are some early signs of fatigue, and a natural desire to have some indication from the authorities about the eventual relaxation of these measures.The First Ministerrsquos important contribution ndash and one that this newspaper has called for ndash was to outline some of the criteria to be applied when such a decision is made. She also stressed that there is no prospect of a swtto ldquonormal conditions before this crisis.Though there are indications the spread of the disease has been contained, and that public compliance with these extraordinary limits on our freedom has bought valuable time for NHS frontline staff, it is important to remember there is as yet no cure for Covid-.To abandon social distancing altogether would be to risk a second, potentially much worse, spike in infections , as well as making it much harder to reintroduce preventive measures. But since most people have demonstrated that they can be trusted to observe physical restraints in public, and become accustomed to them in, for example, supermarkets, there must now be a case for gradually reopening other outlets.Ms Sturgeon was wise to avoid laying out a firm timetable for such changes until we have guidance from medical advisors and more reliable data. A sine qua non for making sure we have the best scientic evidence is going to be more widespread testing than has been available since the very beginning of the outbreak.There are assurances that the UK is on course to meet the target of testing , per day by the end of the month, but that looks dauntingly ambitious. Current testing capacity is half that, at ,, and uptake ndash those actually being tested ndash half that again. In Scotland the numbers are also pitully and worringly low. That urgently needs to be improved.Until it is, it is premature to speculateabout dates for and inidual areas of relaxation. Exactly how and when schools ndash where there are enormous logistical challenges ndash might start to reopen is still unclear what is evident, however, is thatthey do, it will not be anything like business as usual. And such questions should not be exploited to ert attention from whether the authorities have done enough to obtain the data necessary to make those decisions.There is also no reason why Scotland should not erge from other parts of the UK in its measures or its timetablethere are compelling indicators that it is safe to do so. It was reassuring to see the First Minister declare straightforwardly that political and constitutional issues play no part in her thinking, and to insist that only the science will guide policy. Such factors as population density, transmission rates, and the capacity of the health services may well justy slightly dferent timetables across the UK as a whole.That, however, is a judgment that can be made only when we have robust scientic evidence, which can come only with accurate population-wide testing data. It will not mean abandoning all the precautions now in place for some time to come but there is certainly scope for greater public trust and continuing to treat us like adults."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-coronavirus-aftermath-makes-independence-vital-ever","story":"Certainly, it would be foolish not to follow a plan simply because you donrsquot fancy the look of its authors. But when the UK Governmentrsquos response and strategy for containing coronavirus have been found to be deficient then surely a devolved administration has a duty to seek a dferent way within its jurisdictional competence.:UK Govt virus decision-making called into question after it emerges Dominic Cummings attended SAGE meetingsThe Scottish Government, having adhered to Westminsterrsquos plan for the first five weeks of this crisis, is now facing valid questions about the wisdom of sticking to the Johnson roadmap so uncritically. The UK is on course for one of the biggest death tolls in Europe following a haphazard and complacent approach by Westminster. This resulted in three lost weeks prior to the March  lockdown during which the Prime Minister genuinely didnrsquot seem to grasp the gravity of the situation. Scotland has thus fared less well than other similar-sized jurisdictions, most notably Ireland.Mr Johnsonrsquos ministers, standing in for him during his rural confinement, have probably done more damage to the reputation of English public schools than Messrs Philby, Burgess and MacLean. None of them look as though they know whatrsquos going on either as they lurch from one hapless plan to the next. They are also a daily advert for Scottish independence and Ms Sturgeon must now begin the process of decoupling from this train-wreck.How much of this informed Ms Sturgeonrsquos decision yesterday to depart slightly from the UKrsquos direction of travel is open to conjecture. It was the right thing to do though. She seems to be acutely aware that some of our communities and some sections of the population have less of what is needed to deal with the pressures of confinement than others.For every household which will come to view this period as a curious interlude in their comfortable existences there are several who have nothing with which to ease the sense of isolation and helplessness. They donrsquot have gardens sufficiently large and handsome to fix a barbecue or a batch gin-tasting before posting it on social media with a witty apercu.Having emerged from a decade of economic lockout consisting of austerity healthcare cuts and long-term unemployment they are now being told to deal with a lockdown by playing parlour games on Zoom and touching their toes with Joe.We are plainly not all in this together and to suggest otherwise is naiumlve and ignorant. In no country does a one-size-fits-all approach to government work, and certainly not in Scotland. Here there are several regional statelets, distinct from each other in history, culture, faith and geography, which rub along edgily with each other.:Marches in support of Scottish independence postponed to next year amid pandemicItrsquos inconceivable that those who were already struggling before this pandemic will adhere to this universal curfew for longer than another few weeks. Something will have to give lest the country is soon to face outbreaks of serious civil disorder. Ms Sturgeon seems to have sensed this and has moved to offer hope and a little compassion.Lest anyone in the Scottish Government be tempted to promote the advantages of being independent during a global health crisis a few familiar trumpets from the sprawling right-wing commentariat in Scotland have been quick to advise them of the folly of such a position. Why, independence would be unthinkable in these circumstances how could Scotland put together an economic aid package similar to that announced by the UK government to help businesses Presumably, the UK Government simply borrowed like everyone  faced with this situation. What will define the quality of the UK Government isnrsquot how quickly they requisitioned the cash for their bailout package but how they choose to spread the burden of its impact afterwards.Nothing, we are told, will ever be normal again after this. The effects of coronavirus will persist for a generation. Change isnrsquot merely advisable itrsquos necessary. Having walked in the shoes of the poor for a little while we will be compelled to do without in other ways. Andwersquore talking about change then we need also to talk about changing the way we do politics how we make legislation and where we spend money. This is exactly the right time for the wider Scottish independence movement to discuss ways of pressing home the advantage of compassion.The attitude of every Westminster administration since the global banking crisis of  does not engender any confidence that one headed by Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings will act in the interests of the many rather than the few. A decade or so of marginalising communities, intimidating minorities and assuaging the malfeasance of the finance sector ensured that those least able to bear the burden of  footed a disproportionate share of the bill.Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove have already signalled their intent to endanger the UKrsquos coronavirus recovery by insisting that Brexit remains on track. We are fond of mocking President Trump for his increasingly unhinged pronouncements but nothing he has said is as reckless as this. It reinforces the idea that the Johnson government, whose weaknesses have been ruthlessly exposed by coronavirus, is still refusing to take the threat seriously enough.This week, Pope Francis said: ldquoWe were not shaken awake by wars or injustice across the world, nor did we listen to the cry of the poor or of our ailing planet. We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick.The aftermath of coronavirus will expose the true nature of governments. It will lay bare the soul of the cult currently running the UK. Scotland faces a moral choice and one which will define the immediate future of most of her people: to permit our most vulnerable to be prey to the whims of Mr Johnson or to embrace independence as a means of giving them a chance in the economic storm that will follow.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A two-day conference to be held at Glasgow University has been cancelled but some of the other planned projects are going ahead, such as Hold Hands Among The Atoms, a video channel to be hosted online, and The Second Le, an artistsrsquo grant scheme and a nod to the title of one of his most celebrated collections. Hold Hands Among The Atoms goes live on Monday with a video titled Open The Doors!, the title taken from the poem Morgan wrote to celebrate the opening of the Scottish Parliament in . A new film exploring aspects of Morganrsquos work and legacy will be posted on the th of each month.In the more traditional world of paper and print, Edinburgh-based publisher Birlinn has produced The Edwin Morgan Twenties, a five-book boxset collection ided into five categories ndash Love, Scotland, Take Heart, Space And Spaces and Menagerie ndash with each book containing  poems. Meanwhile Glasgow-based indie publisher Speculative Books is putting out a collection of poetry drawn from an open submission and inspired by Morganrsquos celebrated scrapbooks, described by them as ldquovisually arresting, playful, dynamic hellip a queer visual diary, a catalogue of images, and a surreal bricolage. Theyrsquore currently held in Glasgow University Library.Come Monday itself the hashtag #edwinmorgan will be trending in Scotland as readers post their favourite poems on social media, and the event organisers have commissioned a series of digital birthday cards which can be downloaded and posted online. And, of course, many will also find the time to raise a glass or two in celebration.Among them will be Morganrsquos close friend Jackie Kay, a poet and author and the woman who currently holds the position of Makar, having assumed it from Liz Lochhead in .ldquoI think Irsquoll mark it quietly myself with a wee malt in my own wee quaich, and Irsquoll toast him with a Talisker, she tells me. ldquoHe wasnrsquot a great drinker but hersquoll appreciate the toast. You always thought that he would live until  but in a way he has because wersquoll all be thinking of him and celebrating him.Like many Scots, Kay first encountered the work of Edwin Morgan as a teenager, in her case at high school in Bishopbriggs in Glasgow.Kay was  when she first heard Morgan read, at the Highland Institute in Sauchiehall Street. ldquoHe was an amazing reader of his work. He was quite dfident and shy in person but then hersquod get on stage and he was absolutely hilarious. Hersquod have people crying with laughter, so that was really amazing. A bit after that I got to read with him myself, which was even better. I remember doing a reading with him in Cardf when I was about , before I was published. There was me, Edwin Morgan, Sorley MacLean and Norman MacCaig. It felt like an extraordinary experience. She still has a photograph of the event.Kay subsequently became friendly with Morgan. She visited him in the care home he moved to until his death aged  in , and exchanged letters with him. Friendly as they were, however, it was dficult to become close to him. Kay remembers a man who could be guarded and secretive.ldquoI think he got into the way of being secretive after years and years of being in the closet, she says. ldquoI remember making a radio programme with him once called Word On the Street and I asked him about whether he missed the secrecy that being gay involved and to my surprise he said he did, because there was a great power to a secret. There was just the two of you that shared it.Born in Glasgow in  and raised in Rutherglen, Morgan grew up an only child in a wealthy family. His father, Stanley, was the director of a company of iron and steel merchants. Morgan attended Rutherglen Academyand in  enrolled at Glasgow University. Called up in , he registered as a conscientious objectorbut spent the war with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Middle East.After ing to his studies in  and graduating from Glasgow University in English Language and Literature he took a lecturing job in the English department. And there he stayed until retirement in .Morgan published his first poetry collection in  but it was the arrival of The Second Le in  that announced him as a major voice in Scottish poetry. By then he had encountered and been influenced by the American Beat poets, particularly Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, and written some of the poems which remain among his most popular. That list includes The Death Of Marilyn Monroe and King Billy, about the demise and funeral of Billy Fullerton, leader of notorious Glasgow razor gang the Billy Boys.Like Jackie Kay, the actress Elaine C Smith first encountered Morganrsquos work at school, and those two poems in particular have stayed with her.Con man, charlatan, rebel, visionary. Who was the real Malcolm McLaren ldquoI remember being struck by how much it resonated culturally with me, she says. ldquoWersquod been reading Burns before and that didnrsquot so much reflect where I lived and where I came from. King Billy certainly did that. Later, when she was trying for drama school, Smith used Morganrsquos The Death Of Marilyn Monroe as her audition piece and their paths crossed in person many times over the following years. ldquoI donrsquot mean that we were great friends or anything like that, but I shared many a political  with him. He was there at the inaugural meeting of artists for an independent Scotland, and as ever had great things to say ndash incisive, funny, and a man full of humility as well.For fellow actress Kate Dickie and for author and broadcaster Damien Barr, presenter of BBC Scotlandrsquos The Big Scottish Book Club, it was a similar story.Barr, growing up gay in a small village in Lanarkshire, had no idea that the poems he was reading celebrated the love between two men or even that their author was still alive. ldquoI thought all poets had to be dead, but Edwin Morgan was very much still alive and very much still writing about the country that he helped shape with his words. And what an incredible thing for a poet to shape a nation ndash Edwin Morgan shaped our nation with his words just as surely as politicians shape it with their laws.As well as finding his poetic voice by the early-s Morgan had also found love: with John Scott, a storeman in a factory. They remained partners until Scottrsquos death in . Meeting Scott, Morgan said in , ldquowas probably the thing that unleashed most of the poems in the s hellip Most of them, not every one exactly, but most of them did come out of things that actually happened. One example is Strawberries, still one of Morganrsquos most popular poems. It wasnrsquot until , however, that Morgan came out publicly as gay. Until then, his view of his own sexuality was that it was personal. What eventually changed his mind was politics.ldquoI think he would have felt, like a lot of people, that it wasnrsquot really anybodyrsquos business, says Kay. ldquoBut it was also a generational thing. It wasnrsquot that long ago from his point of view that it was illegal and as a gay man you developed a whole way of being to try to avoid being arrested. I think these habits run deep and are hard to shake off even when yoursquore able to. So it was partly societyrsquos fault and partly his own reticence, being quite a private person and thinking that he didnrsquot need to share it until Clause  made him think he absolutely had to.A particularly spiteful and pernicious element of the  Local Government Act brought in by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, Clause  stipulated that local authorities ldquoshall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality or ldquopromote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.Local hero: how Gerry Cinnamon took on the music industry and wonMorgan was  when he came out in . By then he had published widely and in a dazzling array of formats, from sonnets to concrete poetry, and throughout the s and in the years that followed the opening of the Scottish Parliament he found younger collaborators in other fields of artistic endeavour, particularly music. The jazz musician Tommy Smith set a series of Morgan poems about the history of the earth to music in , calling the project Planet Wave. A mixture of music, poetry, electronica, samples and performance it has become a signicant part of the repertoire of Smithrsquos National Jazz Orchestras of Scotland and was performed by it as recently as February. Meanwhile Morgan collaborated with the rock band Idlewild on their  album The Remote Part and five years later two of his poems were used on The Ballad Of The Book, an collaborative album between Scottish musicians and Scottish poets curated by Idlewild frontman Roddy Woomble.As well as poetry Morgan also translated the work of others, beginning with a  translation of Beowulf which is still in use today, and when he won the prestigious Soros Translation Award in  he blew the prize money on a trip to Lapland on Concorde. That was the closest he ever came to space, though things stellar, cosmic and interplanetary were an abiding interest and influence. He was one of the first private citizens to put his name down for a putative space flight and his  collection From Glasgow To Saturn contains such cock-eyed gems as The First Men On Mercury.ldquoThere were certain themes he ed to again and again, says Jackie Kay. ldquoHe wrote a lot about love, about Scotland, about changes in our society, changes in technology. He wrote a lot about le on other planets and about owning and claiming landscape hellip but I think the thing about him is that he canrsquot really be boxed into categories and thatrsquos whatrsquos refreshing about him.So as well as looking backwards and celebrating a le and the work it produced, the Edwin Morgan centenary programme is about asking Scots to look forward, as Morgan himself did, tirelessly and relentlessly.ldquoI think his lasting legacy is that he broke doors open, says Jackie Kay. For her, Morgan was in the very vanguard of th century Scottish writers, a true pioneer, and itrsquos that which we should remember on Monday and for the months ahead.ldquoHe was interested in absolutely everything. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge and his mind was amazing. There was nothing that couldnrsquot be included in a poem ndash anything that interested him, he could find a way to write about it. Thatrsquos interesting as a writer because a lot of poets arenrsquot necessarily like that. They might find things interesting but not be able to write about them or find a poem in them. But Eddy could find poems in the most surprising places. In that way he burst down the stable doors and let out all these horses. He has allowed people a great deal of freedom.And as the man himself might have said, freedom rules OK.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

But we have to do it living with Covid, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.ldquoWe canrsquot wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy wonrsquot survive that long.ldquoBut we are going to have to do it alongside the measures that are in place to protect the population from Covid.

However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body.

Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years. Dferent formations may be used, depending on how many defenders, midfielders, or forwards are worthy of inclusion.Email me at j.tait@shetlandtimesyou have any suggestions..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus testing equipment is in the isles ","story":"New kit which will pave the way for on-island coronavirus testing has arrived in Shetland, paving the way to allow for a quicker turn-around of results.The new equipment means samples taken will no longer have to be flown south to be processed, potentially shaving days off the turn-around time for results.NHS staff have already started training to help them use the equipment. It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle. I see you exemplied my points too # namely numbers ,  and  of the right wing playbook. I see you signed off by patronisingly calling us #boys#. Rising above it eh No one attacked you John.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

years ago on a beautul clear morning we were walking to the monastery on Eilean Chaluim Chille in the drained loch in front of Whitewave in Kilmuir.High up a plane flew over leaving a thick, white vapour trail, soon to be followed by another and another. I started counting them and by the time we reached the island, over  planes had flown across, each leaving a mark in the sky.The clear blue became hazy, and the afternoon never ed to the clarity of when we began our walk.These days in lockdown, as we experience this incredible weather we have the clarity which was lost that day.With few or no airliners flying over, the atmosphere seems sharper, brighter, and maybe pollution from industrial parts spreads worldwide and in the past, found its way over to us via jet streams and high air currents.This pollution seems now much reduced.The talk now is of exit strategies and how we end this lockdown. The term “other side” has been coined and was even used in last week’s very moving front page editorial.What will the other side look like There will be many in tough situations during lock down, and for many more the future will be uncertain, and much of the stress from that uncertainty will probably revolve around financial security.A new normal will have to emerge, and we might hope that it will be more sustainable, on all fronts, both locally and globally.Some say that it was Steve Jobs of Apple computers who turned wants into needs, and empires have been built in our commercial world by making desires into needs.There seem to be business models which require constant expansion or ‘biggering’, to use a phrase from the well-known Dr Suess’ children’s book ‘The Lorax’, which is warning of the consequence of continual industrial growth.It is always worth looking at nature, even when thinking of economy and industry.Diversity is healthy in the natural world, a healthy ecosystem has an element of sustainability, but within that system, things grow and die, and more importantly are eaten, nothing is wasted.Businesses will come and go, but the reliance on a single sector for a whole community could never be healthy.The tourists are unlikely to visit Skye in the numbers they have in the last few years, and perhaps never will again.There will be no ‘go’ button pressed after lock-down, and even next season is likely to be considerably quieter. We will have to learn to exist with the reduced numbers.There is risk in business, such is the way of it, and I suspect there was a perception that investing in tourism on Skye was a fairly reliable bet.Investing to meet the seemingly never-ending demand was something even banks might have been comfortable with. Looking back at the tourist season last year, maybe it just could not have continued growing and growing.Something had to give, it is just that nobody could have envisaged such a collapse, and for such a reason.Many of us are guilty of chasing the dollar, but is it for the dollars sake, is it for needs or wants, and what do we lose in the quest I used to joke about retiring to the city “where the pace of le is slower”. The cliché of getting a work le balance sorted is never more relevant.On my few travels into Portree, I have seen parents playing football with their children in their gardens.

Opening graveyards makes this possible.Today#s decision will bring much comfort to many, not just those who are grieving the loss of a loved one who passed away recently, but also those who find comfort in being close to those they miss.We recognise that appropriate access to burial grounds must be done in a way that ensures appropriate social distancing, and which safeguards those who work there, along with those who have come to visit. As we continue to pray for those in authority who have to make these important decisions, we also pray for those who mourn that they will know the Lord#s comfort.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Kit Adams said he feels more isolated on ing to a Northern Ireland that bears no resemblance to the one he left just a few months ago.When the Co Down man departed his native Newcastle for a stint as a postmaster at Port Lockroy in Antarctica, the main concern back home was the effect Brexit would have on the border between north and south.Now, however, the entire island is in lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic and -year-old Kit, who came home at the end of March, told the Belfastthat it has been a challenge trying to adapt to the culture shock of post-Covid Northern Ireland.It#s strange, but in many respects I have stronger feelings of isolation back home in Co Down than I had when I was living in one of the least populated places on the planet, he said.Even in Antarctica, we actually had quite a few people coming and going. We had cruise ships regularly visiting, with  people at a time passing through [Goudier Island].It#s hard to believe but I see fewer people now I#m home!Here, however, it#s all about making the best of a bad situation and seeing the good where it is.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the background FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the backgroundSince histo Northern Ireland, Kit has been enjoying spending time with dad Colin, an estate agent, conservation volunteer mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps.You become fantastically close to people you#re away with and then everybody goes their separate ways so it#s nice to be back with family, he said.The young adventurer, who already had three Arctic expeditions under his belt before he left for the other pole, said the experience more than lived up to his expectations.It was fantastic - I could have stayed a bit longerit had been an option but we had to come back before winter set in, he said.Perhaps surprisingly, the geography graduate said he was not on his own that often when he was there.We had some trouble getting in initially because of sea ice and at the start of the season we were iced in so we didn#t see anybody  for a week, he said.We had to gather bits of icebergs and melt it down for water.We#d only been on the island for a few days when the wind direction changed and it blew a load of ice close to the island and none of the ships could get in, but we managed.At that point, there were only six of them there, but later there were ious people coming and going from conservators to electricians and other workers.Being postmaster in such a remote part of the world was quite interesting, according to Kit, whose job entailed sending missives all over the world.It was always a surprise where things went to from here, he said.Tourists coming to the island sent mostly postcards or letters, staff sent stuff to family and friends and people also wrote to us from all over the world asking us for information about ious things.He added: We all received stuff as well from family and friends which was nice.Kit admitted that he pined for nothing while he was gone.It sounds bad but there really wasn#t an awful lot I missed, he added. It was warm, dry and there was lots of chocolate.The lack of normality he now faces at home is a bit strange, Kit explained.You go away and you come back with all these grand plans to go travelling or something... he said.And then I found myself in a not too dissimilar situation than I was in Antarctica.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKit Adams FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKit AdamsBut he certainly sounds happy enough.It#s really not that bad, Kit said. You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bronagh O#Connell was speaking after the death of her parents Ignatiusand Mary .Mr O#Connell passed away on April , before his we died at their Strathmore Park home in north Belfast on April .They were laid to rest together on Monday in the village of Carrigart in Co Donegal, where they enjoyed many summers together.Mrs O#Connell was head of art at Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her husband was principal of St Augustine#s secondary school on the Ravenhill Road before moving to St Joseph#s teacher training college.The couple would have been married  years this August, having met in the s while teaching in Ballycastle. They have two daughters, Bronagh and Aine.Speaking to the Belfast , Bronagh said that losing her parents in such a short period of time has left an indescribable void.We have a very small family and to lose an entire generation in one fell swoop is just overwhelming, she said.Bronagh explained that when the coronavirus outbreak began she brought both her parents to stay at her Randalstown home so they had less chance of catching it.However her father, who suffered from Alzheimer#s, began to develop symptoms of a chest infection and was prescribed an antibiotic by a GP.They were warned thatit had no effect within  hours then they must contact their GP again.Praising the GPs in Salisbury Medical Centre and the Covid- team from Grove Wellbeing Centre, Bronagh said they had gone above and beyond the call of duty.The GP said to get them back to their home in Belfast and they would take things from there after the antibiotic didn#t work, Bronagh added. They askedwe wanted to nurse them at home. My daddy had Alzheimer#s andthey both went to hospital we wouldn#t have been able to nurse them or visit them, and they would have died on their own.After arriving at their home in Belfast Mrs O#Connell developed the same symptoms her husband had just three days later, but she was in a much worse condition.Following the death of her father Bronagh was advised to be tested for Covid- and the result came back positive.Thankfully the community midwe is making a full recovery at home. Due to the current restrictions at funerals, only a few family members were able to take the long drive to Donegal, but with the roads being deserted Bronagh felt it was like the path was open for her parents to go to Heaven.I don#t think we have grieved at all yet, she added.You just do the al things, but mummy and daddy are constantly in our minds.There was a Mass but nobody was allowed to attend and the coffins weren#t allowed in the chapel at all.The priest told me that it was the first time in his professional le that he buried a husband and we together.Urging Stormont not to lt the lockdown too soon, Bronagh used her own family#s loss as an example of what can happen.We have no mummy and daddy and granny and grandad anymore, she said.I know people are restricted being in lockdown, but when I look at my mummy and daddy, they got sick and they went nowhere.I think when the lockdown is lted we will see a rise in deaths as people will go crazy.People aren#t abiding to the regulations as well as they should. If the lockdown is lted too soon we will have a pandemic.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is of course vital that everyone continues to implement social distancing and stay safe.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also endorsed the decision: The trauma of losing a loved one has been made more dficult by the lockdown restrictions that seek to prevent the transmission of Covid-. The suspension of our traditional way of marking a passing and processing grief has been very hard for many people to bear. I#m glad that the latest medical and scientic advice offers some relief for those seeking to visit loved ones and that we can permit the opening of cemeteries and graveyards with controls on social distancing. It#s a matter of regret that parties publicly moved to dferent positions this week before hearing the advice necessary to make a determination on this issue.

Mrs Foster said that following advice on social distancing and public hygiene had made a signicant contribution to reducing the peak of the pandemic.We#ve flattened the curve, but now is not the time to be careless, we are not out of the woods, she added.Glancing across to the Deputy First Minister, Mrs Foster continued: We both know that a lot is being asked of the bereaved at this time. But we would not be asking you to respect these restrictions were it not quite literally a matter of le and death.Sinn Fein had been opposed to reopening cemeteries, but faced intensying pressure this week from unionists, from grieving families who wanted to visit loved ones# graves, and from Church leaders.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill defended her party#s change of position, saying ministers had listened carefully to the distress of families.I understand there#s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burdens in terms of their mental health and wellbeing and our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus, she said. We recognised the comfort of visiting the grave of a loved one, and what that means to so many people. That#s why we had committed to keeping this issue of graveyards under review.We#ve listened very carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one.The opening up of graveyards will be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds who can ensure we have compliance with the regulations on appropriate social distancing.

Many of us can rely on family members, friends, or local support for help. However, there are people having to self-isolate who are experiencing dficulties and it is for those people that this service has been introduced.I am aware that community pharmacies have been working extremely hard to meet the increased demand for home deliveries of medicines within their communities. I am greatly encouraged to report that over  pharmacies have signed up to the new scheme and  of them have been matched with a community or voluntary sector organisation.

Fr John McNamara , who had no underlying health conditions, was admitted to the Ulster Hospital in February for surgery on his back.He was recovering and had been transferred to Musgrave Park Hospital as part of his recuperation.But it is believed he contracted the virus there and passed away on Thursday.Fr John, originally from Scotland, was a member of the Carmelite Order and was well-known and much-loved by thousands of people in Londonderry, where he spent the past  years at Iona Retreat Centre .He had a particular calling for the sacrament of confession and many came to Termonbacca to receive absolution from him.Prior at Termonbacca Fr John Grennan paid tribute to the popular monk.He said: Fr John loved Derry and loved the people of Derry and was very loved and respected by the people of Derry, especially for his confessional ministry.We have been taking so many phone calls from people, many in tears who have been greatly saddened at his passing.He was a priest in the outskirts of Glasgow but came to the Carmelite Order in  and moved to Derry in , and although he was , he was fit and healthy with no intention of retiring from ministry.Fr Grennan described Fr John as the anchor man of the community, adding: He was someone who loved to chat, he was someone you could always depend on and certainly he wasn#t someone who intended to stop his ministry.He had no intention of retiring, in fact he was organising a pilgrimage to Lourdes in August, as he did every year, and he would have led this along with another priest from the Order in Dublin.Our hope was he would recuperate fully even though it would have been a long road, but he was recovering well and was rehabilitating in Musgrave Hospital, where they noticed something was wrong.Not too long after he contracted the virus he passed away, but the chaplain from the hospital was able to give him the last rites, so at least he did get that consolation.Before the coronavirus control measures came into effect the Catholic Apostolic movement Cursillo based its weekend retreats at Termonbacca, greatly assisted by Fr John.President of the Derry branch of Cursillo Aoe O#Neill said: Fr John was small in stature but a real big presence in the lives of so many people. He had such a vibrancy about him, no one would ever have guessed he was the age he was.He was always on hand to help during our Cursillo weekends, particularly with confessions, where he was amazing.So many people would only go to Fr John for confessions because he would always listen, give good counsel and guidance.The suddenness of his death, the sadness of this whole situation and that we won#t be able to pay our final respects, is without a doubt adding to people#s grief and will add to our sense of loss.It is sad for us but we can take great comfort in the knowledge he is one person for sure who is definitely enjoying his Heavenly rewards.For a monk who lived a cloistered le, he was very present and always made himself very available and he will be greatly missed, and not just by the people of Derry.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To have kept the sheets for  years and never use them and give them up now is such a huge thing.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lisburn woman Suzie Arbuthnothas been hosting weekly virtual cook-alongs on her Instagram page and YouTube channel alongside Belfast-based artist Aly Harte, BBC presenter Holly Hamilton, Cool FM breakfast show host Pete Snodden, motorbike star Jonathan Rea and recently retired Irish rugby captain Rory Best.The videos have been filmed in their own home kitchens and recipes featured to date have included #hidden# vegetable lasagne, chocolate sandwich cream, potato farls and Japanese pan-fried dumplings.Since being crowned the  champion of the primetime show back in February, Suzie has become a well-known local face.Beating fellow finalists Sarah Woods and Georgia Salamat to the title of Best Home Cook, she dazzled Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett and produce expert Chris Bavin with Mary Berry#s ultimate three-course dinner party.Her cooking skills were described as absolutely tremendous - and she now has plenty of spare time on her hands to share her secrets with fans.The self-employed accountant is currently in lockdown at her home outside Lisburn with her husband Steven , an A-level psychology teacher at Omagh Academy, and their two children, Odeliaand five-year-old Zander.As someone who is normally always on the go, whether it#s to the gym, hockey practice or choir rehearsals, Suzie admits that after four weeks of lockdown she is going stir crazy.I#m not used to being stuck at home and it has been quite hard to adjust, she said.I#m fortunate that my husband is still teaching [from home] and bringing in an income but my job has stopped as I can#t get out to see clients. Steven is loving getting to spend so much time with the kids as he#s not on the road to Omagh every day.It has been mentally dficult knowing that I don#t need to do  things at once because he is here to help.Having this time has made me reassess and I know I shouldn#t complain because I have my health.Suzie says Steven can also take credit for coming up with the idea of the Friday afternoon cook-alongs at pm.It was his brainchild, and because I was already doing them with the kids anyway, he thought it would be fun to get some other people and their families involved, too.Since we are all stuck at home we are cooking more than normal so it#s the ideal time to get families into the kitchen to learn about food and gain confidence.I try to make things simple as we have to create the dish within an hour.The feedback has been really lovely as more and more people are watching and telling me how they got on trying the recipes.And they love to see that I#m in the same position as them in terms of still managing to cook with kids crawling all over me.I have also been trying to push local food suppliers to keep them going, and thankfully it seems to work as they say their business is booming.Belfast Most ReadTwo men arrested after #mass brawl# in Markets area of BelfastNewborn twins ensure names of tragic Spence men will live onDriving for exercise allowed in certain circumstances, Executive confirms Celeb chef Suzie Arbuthnot cooks up virtual treat in lockdown with a few well-known faces Jim Donegan murder: Police appeal for potential witness to come forward,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The community in Magherafelt responded to a plea from nurses for accommodation in the area and within  hours, a house had been located and refurnished ready for them to move in. Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit. He told the County Derry Post: “One of the nurses had been askingthere was any accommodation available – Air BnB or something along those lines in the Magherafelt area. googletag.cmd.push “Somebody had tagged me into it and that’s how I got involved. I sent her a message to give me a ring and she rang me more or less straight away. “That was on the Friday evening and I met them over at the house at a quarter to  on the Saturday morning. It was a bit rough round the edges, it had been lying empty for a while.  “The fella that has recently bought it had said to me a few weeks ago thatit was of any use to anybody, to use away at it. He brought the keys down and left them with me.” googletag.cmd.push Darren posted online appealing for help to make the house a bit more inhabitable for the healthcare staff and found himself inundated with offers from both friends and strangers. “I threw it up on Facebook asking for a favour from anyone who could help kit a house out from start to finish,” he said. “There were people who came here with tins of paint. Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-. He said: “They were over the moon. They would have taken it as it was on Saturday morning, but I asked them to give me a day or two to make it a bit more homely for them. “The whole thing took legs, there’s a real good will out there at the minute and not a penny changed hands. “It was all hands to the pump and it was amazing to be part of it. You would have thought anyone working in that house had been friends for le, they were chatting away to each other. With the house ready to move into on Saturday evening, the mammoth effort left out just one important utensil. “The only thing we forgot about was a tin opener,” said Darren, “but that’s sorted now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The annual event was due to take place in venues across the city area next month but was cancelled due to COVID-. However, Council have instead put together a digital programme that will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May th to Sunday May th - called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions. People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of .

Although I donrsquot remember him riding, I know he did so for many years, and was also a trainer and owned horses right up to .His son, Pat, also rode as an amateur and professional, spending a good bit of his riding days with Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club. He acted as a steward at the Armagh PTSP on April .He is predeceased by his first we, Dr Barbara, and also Lady Jane Alexander. He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

He said those who leave their vehicles outside the parks do so to avoid paying entrance fees and walk in instead.ldquoBoth parks have been shut since the coronavirus outbreak and now the government department responsible for them has agreed that they can reopen, continued Mr McGrath.ldquoHowever, local people are concerned that the move to open the parks for pedestrians only will encourage people to travel from further away and park outside their entrance gates.Mr McGrath said agriculture minister Edwin Poots is encouraging police to patrol the areas outside the parks and to manage this accordingly.The MLA added: ldquoThis is something I would also endorse and urge people to remember that the parks are only open for pedestrians.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

No less a person than gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh believes the Government has been unfair to garden centres by deeming them non-essential, forcing them to close during this emergency whilst supermarkets can carry on selling plants and flowers.He said this week that ‘ garden centres were to put in place the same protocols as supermarkets then they who earn their entire living from horticulture should be allowed to’. I rang my regular garden centre for advice and, yes, they were closed but I could place an order by phone or online with them. I couldn’t visit and stroll around to pick what I wanted, but they could deliver a phoned order or I could pick it up so long as I stayed in the car on their driveway and paid by swiping my card. I was happy with that though it deprived me of seeing what promising new plants and garden decorations were available. The colourful ladybirds on my garden shed door are not real, but metal, bought in the garden centre last year. It is this kind of trade that our garden centres will be deprived of and that is hardly fair to them.Without any worries about rain the digging began, the ground being a lot harder than I expected, obviously due to the dry weather. The bags of compost, delivered to my door by the garden centre, were all used up in no time and two days later planting began, watched by my menagerie of pets.Nightly watering was necessary but a great sense of satisfaction set in that despite the tough stance on garden centres people like me were able to progress our gardens.So le was rosy then  Not quite. After a couple of days I noticed my dog wasn’t in great form. In fact he was throwing up over the lawn, though he wasn’t running a temperature. He still wanted to go out for his evening walk so I assumed that he would recover. On the second day of throwing up I was about to ring the vet for an appointment but decided to investigate more closely what he had brought up and it was plain to see that one or other cat had found a new toilet spot amongst the plants and one nosey dog decided it seemed good enough to eat.I suppose there are more important things for the older generation to worry about than protecting their plants from inquisitive cats and dogs. For example, there are calls to remove the triple lock on the state pension – it rises by .pc yearly – which could see the value of the pension fall back while prices rise.The suggestion comes from the think tank Social Market Foundation, which believes the Government ‘should abandon the system to ensure the economy recovery from the coronavirus crisis is fair to working-age households’. It must think, wrongly, that my generation has had it too good.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Every so often a splinter or chunk falls off. The colour on the planks is faded, cracked and peeling.It was some time ago that my we first suggested I should paint the fence. Two years back, I think. I have been considering the task ever since then, coming to terms with it.When my we occasionally inquires about when the job will be commenced, I patiently state that there are a myriad of factors which need to be in my favour before I can even think about starting such an enterprise. If she persists, I plead that it is too complicated to explain. I don’t like to rush into things.The garden fence stretches into the misty horizon \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But the current lockdown has concentrated minds and removed distraction. On a crisp morning my we informs me that she and my son are going to start on the fence. My jaw tightens and I feel the burn in my cheeks.‘No, it’s alright, I’ll do it....I was thinking about painting it today anyway.’Half an hour later I’m standing at my back gate with my boy, who is staring at me with curiosity.I have slipped into working man mode, a rare and distinct condition which he has not witnessed often. There are certain tells. I walk about a lot shaking my head and muttering under my breath. I stare dolefully at inanimate objects. I curse a whole generation of earlier tradesmen whose inferior labour I am going to have to correct. I wipe my hands on my trousers while emitting a low growl. I look about for a nail to put in my mouth but cannot locate one.An alarming amount of time is wasted trying to open the tin of paint. My son watches me struggle, and laughs when I boot it in frustration.And then, finally, we are ready. My thought is that my boy can assist me, father and son working together, passing my wisdom and experience down to the next generation, bonding over sweat. We select a plank and begin to paint.Fourteen seconds later he says: ‘Daddy, I’m bored of this, can I go and play now ’I had expected as much. Luckily I have a cultural reference which can assist. I loved reading Tom Sawyer at school, particularly the scene where he tricks his friends into painting his garden fence.I step back, peering admiringly at the newly applied colour.‘That’s ok buddy, it’s just such a shame that you are going to miss all of the fun.’‘What fun daddy ’‘Well, the fun of painting. This is not work, it’s play. After all it’s not everyday that a man gets the chance to paint a fence. Boy oh boy, am I going to have some fun today.’The trap has been set and I can see there is a momentary confusion in his features. I give him a fatherly smile. He looks back.‘Duh daddy!’ he says, before running off.Deflated, I slap some more paint on wood, cursing Mark Twain’s novel for the fancul nonsense that it clearly is. I work on alone, my solitary state causing my thoughts to meander until I fix upon another cultural reference. There is a scene in The Karate Kid film where Mr Miyagi teaches Daniel the hidden secrets of martial arts by getting him to use a certain technique to paint his fence.I try to recreate it now. Long flowing vertical strokes with the brush, mobilising the flexibility of my wrist. Wrist up, wrist down. I can feel a newfound power flowing through my left arm. Wrist up, wrist down.Two minutes later I have to stop because I have developed cramp in my wrist. I switch to my right hand but the cramp appears here even sooner, complemented by the added hindrance of losing the feeling in my fingers. This causes me to drop the brush on my foot. I don’t remember this scene from the movie.Abandoning any hopes of a new career as a full-combat karate champion, I reduce my ambition to just getting some paint onto the fence. The truth, which both Tom Sawyer and Mr Miyagi ignored, is that there is no comfortable way of doing this. I try brushing up and down, side to side, diagonally, in circles. I try painting the outline of squares, and then colouring them in. It makes no dference my arm aches and I can feel my back beginning to seize up.I’m forced to consider alternatives. Just throwing the can of paint at the fence is attractive, but likely to be messy and inefficient. I seriously ponder the prospect of removing my boot, lying on the ground and gripping the brush between my toes, but the woman from across the road is watching out her window and I suspect she already thinks me a little strange. Best not to lower her opinion still further.I plough on stubbornly, becoming more reckless. There is, to be sure, some paint on the wood, but probably more on my clothes, skin and hair. I think,such a thing is possible, that I may have stained the insides of my eyelids. My son rides past on his scooter.‘Are you still having fun daddy ’I scowl and put down the brush and survey what I have achieved. I have painted part of the gate. My property is not large but the totality of the fence seems to stretch off into the misty horizon like the Great Wall of China. I wonderour garden fence can be seen from space.I go back inside.‘Have you finished ’ my we asks hopefully.I chuckle inwardly at the naivety of the query.‘No, no,’ I respond. ‘A job like this has to be done in stages.’‘But you’ve only been at it for less than an hour.’‘I know, but, but...you have to let the paint soak into the wood. Whoever painted it before did a bad job, that’s slowing me down.’She looks at me doubtfully.‘Don’t worry,’ I continue. ‘I’ll do a bit more tomorrow....or maybe the day after.’—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In a comment which slipped by without provoking any reaction, she said “social distancing is going to be a feature of our lives it’s going to be a feature of our lives for perhaps up to a couple of yearsnot beyond”.As the two leaders spoke yesterday, the Department of Health confirmed “a further  people have sadly lost their lives to Covid-”.

Please try again later.Submitting...The total fatalities for the UK now stands at , . Globally the figure last night was , . There has been tension recently within the Executive, with Sinn Fein generally favouring a hardline approach to easing restrictions, and the DUP more inclined to allow some limited leeway – with the cemeteries a stark example of the ision.The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry, last night described the reopening of cemeteries as “a sensible and compassionate response to an important pastoral and human need”.UUP leader Steve Aiken called it “a humanitarian act”.Jim Allister, TUV leader, declared: “The dys of the Executive delayed this for at least a week, causing needless hurt to many grieving families. Those behind the delay owe such families not just an explanation but an apology.”The public desire for reopening graveyards was gruesomely illustrated during the week when DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson announced a pensioner had impaled himself on railings while trying to climb over them to visit his we’s grave.Arlene Foster said: “We’ve agreed to support the health minister in lting the restrictions on access to graveyards. This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones’ grave.”But she added: “Please do remain at home as much as possible. We’re not out of the woods.”On Tuesday Declan Kearneyhad told MLAs on the floor of the Assembly: “I and Executive colleagues understand how extremely dficult it is that members of our families, inidual friends, and our community are being denied the solace that moments of reflection at gravesides and places of worship can provide, but that is the price that we must pay because the coronavirus pandemic is an emergency.”At yesterday’s news conference, Michelle O’Neill was quizzed on how Sinn Fein “got this so badly wrong”.She responded: “I always said we’d keep these things under review, and we listened very carefully to what people had to say. And you have to get that fine balance between protecting people’s lives and also then listening to people whenever they’ve expressed concern.“So I’m glad the Executive has found a way forward... That’s us listening to people at this moment in time, that’s us understanding the angst that was there, that’s us not wanting to exasperate [sic] anyone’s mental health or families that are grieving right now.“But our number one priority right now is about dealing with the fact we’re still in the mist [sic] of the pandemic.”Asked about north-south co-operation on combating coronavirus, Ms O’Neill indicated that on this side of the Irish Sea “the numbers speak for themselves, insofar as our death rate here has been  to % less than what’s sadly been experienced in Britain”.She added that “we are an island and we have to use that to our advantage”.In the Republic, as of yesterday there had been  deaths.However, Mrs Foster said that comparing death figures in the Republic with Northern Ireland “is a little bit more nuanced than perhaps some people have presented”, because of “dferent data systems” and dferent reporting times for deaths.We need to share information [with the Republic]” she said. “But it’s also true to say we’ve greatly benefitted from being part of the UK as well.”When it comes to why Northern Ireland’s death rate is relatively low compared with Great Britain, she said “population density has a big impact on this”.For example, she said London has population density of nearly , people per square kilometre, against just  per sq km for Northern Ireland.A number of councils got in touch last night to say when they will re-open cemeteries some said Saturday, others Sunday.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns. Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcdbffadbde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdfebeeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
