They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.  Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

A report today found that the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 a fridge freezer in the flat\u0027s kitchen. A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window  The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchenIn a witness statement, Mr Kebede said he was woken by a fire alarm around 12:55am. He went into the kitchen and saw smoke around the fridge-freezer and woke other residents of his flat and surrounding homes before fleeing the building. The recording was played after the publication of a damning report found the cladding put on the outside of the building did not comply \u0027with recommended fire performance\u0027 and criticised the \u0027stay-put\u0027 policy which encouraged residents to remain in their flats in the event of the fire.Fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane said the fire service\u0027s  policy had \u0027effectively failed\u0027 barely a half-hour after the fire started, but residents weren\u0027t told to evacuate for more than an hour after that.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleThe cladding meant the fire spread up seven storeys within seven minutes,  with 70 flats ablaze in under two hours. The disaster was compounded by non-compliant fire doors, combustible window fittings and a faulty firefighting lift. Ms Lane said that a renovation of the building completed in 2016 installed flammable  cladding on the tower\u0027s facade which led to \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027.\u0027The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire\u0027 to an extent that would have support a \u0027stay put\u0027 policy, she said.Ms Lane said there had been \u0027a culture of non-compliance\u0027 with safety regulations, and identified multiple failures.The \u0027stay put\u0027 guidance which was given to residents before the fire was eventually abandoned at 2.47am - around two hours after the fire started.Ms Lane\u0027s report said it is unclear why there was such a gap between the advice being rendered redundant and the fire service changing tack, the report said.\u0027I am particularly concerned by the delay from 2.06am, when a major incident was declared, to 2.47am,\u0027 Dr Lane continued.           A photo of the flat once the debris had been cleared away shows how the other electrical items added to the damage done          Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside. The partition where sliding doors had led to the living room was almost completely burned away          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway. As firefighters moved towards the kitchen however, the fire was much more intense, scorching the hallway leading to the kitchen (right)          Grainy images taken from body cameras worn by firefighters show the moment they opened to door to the kitchen fire          The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeBut University of Dundee Professor Niamh Daeid wrote: \u0027On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in, or around, the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen.\u0027The cause of the fire remains undetermined although, based on the available information, it is more likely than not to be an accidental cause rather than a deliberate act.\u0027The originating fire within flat 16 extended out of the kitchen window of the flat and at some point re-entered through the window of the bedroom next to the living room of flat 16 causing further damage to the flat.\u0027 In a departure from information given by the Met Police, another expert said there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 that the fire was started by the fridge-freezer.In another separate report, Professor Luke Bisby, from the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \u0027Some evidence exists to support a hypothesis that the fire started in the south-east side of the kitchen and in the general area of the Hotpoint FF175P fridge-freezer, however, there is currently insufficient evidence, even based on a balance of probabilities, in my opinion, to support the hypothesis that the fire originated in the fridge-freezer, and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition.\u0027With regard to other possible sources of ignition, I have not seen sufficiently convincing evidence to confidently identify the origin of the initial fire.\u0027 Shocking footage shows how a fire which started in a kitchen of a Grenfell Tower flat leapt up the side of the building. The left hand image is timed at 1.08am, not long after the blaze began. By 1.12am the fire had already started to growIn clips estimated to have been filmed between 1.16 and 1.20am, burning debris could be seen falling from the tower, and screaming could be heard.\u0027I told you, I told you get out,\u0027 one man could be heard shouting in a further clip.Six clips showing the side of the tower as it became engulfed with flames were shown side by side.\u0027Oh my god,\u0027 one woman said as huge pieces of fiery debris rained down from the blazing tower.Another could be heard sobbing as it became apparent the fire was out of control.After the video was shown, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027It is truly shocking, every time you see it, it strikes you in a very similar way, very strongly.\u0027   This image, timed at 1.15 am, shows how, helped by flammable cladding and window materials, the fire began to grow  By 1:24am (left), the flames were burning through flats on multiple floors. An image taken from footage filmed around 1.28am (right) shows how, aided by what a report called \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027, the fire reached the top                                                      More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did nothing and a shambolic \u0027stay put\u0027 policy: Litany of Grenfell safety failings that led to a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027           \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeDeadly doors and cladding coupled with advice to victims stay in their flats as Grenfell Tower was engulfed by fire caused a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027, the inquiry into Britain\u0027s worst blaze in living memory revealed today.Expert witness Dr Barbara Lane decried the \u0027stay put\u0027 advice given by the emergency services to residents trapped in the burning building as a \u0027total failure\u0027 and \u0027substantially to blame for the tragedy\u0027.Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed it took one hour and 11 minutes for the authorities to change their minds and start an evacuation.But by then there was little hope of escaping the tower, which was engulfed in flames in just 20 minutes.Dr Lane also spoke of a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 at Grenfell, which had there were more than 100 non-compliant fire doors, a firefighting lift that didn\u0027t work and a tinderbox cladding system and draughty windows that accelerated the blaze. Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed that it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openIn 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose The lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.          A photo shows the softened uPVC finish revealing the cavity and combustible insulation board within in living room in flat 16Another of her conclusions was that key bodies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower understood how the new cladding system would behave in a fire, a report has said.In the report Dr Lane said: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027          Pictured: All of the 72 victims of the Grenfell fire disaster and where they lived  Grenfell cladding had SEVEN catastrophic faults, was incorrectly installed and \u0027substantially to blame\u0027 for disaster that killed 72, inquiry hearsGrenfell Tower\u0027s cladding did not comply with building regulations, was badly installed and created routes for a fire to spread, a damning report into the blaze has concluded.Five fire safety experts have been examining the fire in which 82 people died and today gave their views on how the fire started, how it spread and why so many people were killed.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading, she found.            The cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower was to blame for the fire spreadingAnother expert, Professor Luke Bisby, found a series of problems with refurbishment work carried out on Grenfell before the fire.Prof Bisby said the main reason the fire spread was the polyethylene-filled ACM rainscreen in the cladding.He also said combustible insulation, the presence of cavities and the use of combustible window frames added to the spread of the blaze.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleProf Bishby also identified the lack of cavity barriers between sections of the cladding, a \u0027crown detail\u0027 which helped the fire spread sideways and exposed parts of the combustible core added to the fire.In her report meanwhile, Dr Lane found there was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.She wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027        A detail from a report shows the cladding on the building which helped the fire spreadThis required smoke-control in multiple lobbies, firefighting efforts on multiple floors and on the exterior of the building, the need for a change of the evacuation strategy and the need for disabled residents to self-evacuate \u0027for which no facilities were provided within the building\u0027.The scale of the cladding\u0027s shortcomings never appears to have been grasped by any of the key bodies linked to the refurbishment.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027  Grenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with fire safety and building regulations, report finds as expert slams \u0027incompetency\u0027 in the construction industryGrenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with basic fire safety measures, a damning report has concluded.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, listed an astonishing series of shortcomings in the systems intended to mitigate fire risk.Failure to abide by regulations were identified with the block\u0027s lifts, ventilations systems, fire mains and fire doors.            Residents had been told to \u0027stay put\u0027 in the case of a fire, but fire doors were inadequateThese would have hindered the escape of residents on the night of the fire, as well as the effort to tackle the fire, while also worsening the spread of smoke.Her conclusions came as another expert looking into the Grenfell Tower fire warned of the danger of using \u0027guidelines and simple  tests\u0027 to test buildings and of \u0027incompetency\u0027 within the industry.Professor Jose L Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.He warned that that a \u0027culture shift\u0027 is needed, otherwise \u0027the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing?

Five experts have given reports into the blaze for the inquirySmoke leaked through gaps in the frames and some would probably not have self-closed after fleeing residents, allowing it to spread further. The firefighters themselves may have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, she added.In one particularly grim case, a fire door leading to the stairwell was propped open by a body, the inquiry was told. The automatic air ventilation system in the building was also not \u0027in accordance with current statutory guidance\u0027 and there was evidence it did not operate as intended, she added.The lifts in the building similarly failed to perform effectively in the fire, hampering firefighter equipment transport and creating an \u0027unnecessary risk\u0027 to residents who could not use it to escape.For firefighters, the tower had a \u0027dry fire main\u0027 - meaning the fire service had to pump it with its own water - that was \u0027non-compliant with the design guidance in force at the time of the original construction and is also non-compliant with current standards\u0027.This stopped crews getting water to the upper floors as effectively as a wet main, which provides more pressure by being already charged with a pump that is connected when the service arrives.  Professor Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.  In his report, Prof Torero said the current regulatory framework relies \u0027very heavily\u0027 on competent professionals interpreting the guidelines in such a way that will bridge any gaps and ambiguities.But he claimed there was no definition of the level of competency required from professionals involved in designing and installing cladding systems which would guarantee the delivery of \u0027societally acceptable levels of safety\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There is a need to shift from a culture that inappropriately trivialises \u0027compliance\u0027 to a culture that recognises complexity in \u0027compliance\u0027 and therefore values \u0027competency\u0027, \u0027performance\u0027 and \u0027quality\u0027.\u0027Otherwise, the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027 He wrote: \u0027Functional requirements, guidelines and simple standardised tests become insufficient tools to establish adequate performance of systems where performance is a function of the interactions of the building and the building envelope.\u0027The inadequacy of these methods of performance assessmentregulation is such that systems that can introduce obvious dangers can be incorporated by designers in a routine manner.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/17/4CE82CC700000578-5803229-image-a-44_1528128092277.jpg","title":"Travellers dump hundreds tons building waste garbage M1 underpass","story":"    Nine lanes of motorway traffic drive over the underpass which is being turned into an unofficial dump site.

A table from a report published today shows how quickly flats were engulfedDr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading.In a report published on Monday, Dr Lane wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027Windows in inidual flats had no fire barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material, the expert found.Such a shortcoming \u0027increased the likelihood of that fire breaking into the large cavities contained within the cladding system\u0027 and provided \u0027no means to control the spread of fire and smoke\u0027.The gap beyond the window, in turn, was supposed to have fire-stops at intervals which would halt the advance of flames - but these were installed incorrectly.There was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.

chance","story":"    Inferno: Grenfell Tower in flames last year after a fire started in the tower block in Kensington1 There is no statutory requirement for central alarm systems in tower blocks because it would conflict with the policy of residents ‘staying put’ in flats.2 No sprinklers.3 Firefighters should have directed their hoses on or above the fire, but videos show they were being targeted below.4 A pipe system to get water up the 24-storey block could not cope and was overloaded – leaving the upper floors, where most people died, vulnerable.5 Water pipe failure meant fire crews had to pump their own water onto the fire.6 The failure of the fire lift system delayed firefighters.7 Advice for residents to stay put in the event of a fire was futile within half an hour of the blaze breaking out – but still slavishly adhered to for another 80 minutes.8 Combustible cladding panels and insulation systems were ruled ‘substantially to blame’.9 Two types of cladding and four different insulation layers did not comply with building regulations.10 Two cavity barriers did not have the required fire performance certificates.11 The cladding produced toxic smoke that slowed the firefighters as it forced them to wear breathing apparatus.12 Designers and builders had no idea how the cladding system would perform in a fire as no tests were carried out.13 Neither the London Fire Brigade nor Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which was responsible for Grenfell, carried out risk assessments of the cladding.14 Flammable aluminium panels fixed to the tower and on more than 300 other blocks across England were never subjected to a full British Standard fire test.15 Stairwell was too narrow and soon became impassable thanks to smoke, darkness, firefighters and distressed and dying victims.16 An architectural feature called a ‘crown’ at the top of the building caught fire and also helped the blaze spread horizontally.17 Design of tower blocks is supposed to ‘compartmentalise’ fires into inidual flats – but this was not effective at Grenfell.18 Ventilation system for removing smoke from lobbies failed.19 Fire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing stopped the blaze leaping up the tower.20 A ‘culture of non-compliance’ appeared to exist in the maintenance of the tower.21 Most of the fire doors leading to the 120 flats were relatively new but did not comply with building regulations.22 Some doors failed within 20 minutes even though they should have blocked fire for an hour.23 Doors were fitted with a variety of different locks, hinges and letter plates that could significantly reduce fire resistance.24 Forty-eight doors had glazing that failed and allowed flames and smoke to pass directly through.25 Fourteen of the doors to Grenfell’s flats were of unknown origin.26 Some doors designed to ‘self-close’ failed to do so, allowing the fire to spread more quickly.27 Doors were left open by fire hoses and in one case, a body.28 Defective windows installed in the 2012-16 refurbishment allowed the fire to spread from a single kitchen to the external cladding through gaps in frames.29 Windows had no fire-resistant cavity barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material.30 During refurbishment, the windows were fitted in an ‘improvised manner’ that may have made them less safe.    Five experts deliver their verdict on blaze that left 72 deadBy Vanessa Allen and Arthur Martin for The Daily MailBasic flaws with the cladding at Grenfell Tower and an extraordinary litany of fire safety failings caused the inferno that claimed 72 lives, it was revealed yesterday.On the first day of formal evidence at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, a devastating report found the cladding was ‘substantially to blame’ for fuelling a blaze that leapt 19 floors in just 12 minutes.Its flammable plastic core helped fuel the fire and produced toxic smoke that slowed firefighters, while its design contributed to the ‘catastrophic’ spread of the flames.  How the fire spread: What began as a fire in a single apartment at Grenfell Tower (left) quickly spread (right)The report was just one of five presented to the inquiry yesterday, outlining an incredible catalogue of failures encompassing virtually every aspect of fire safety at the block in Kensington, west London.Almost all elements of fire safety at the tower failed – from dangerous fire doors and windows to firefighters who inadvertently helped the flames to spread – leading to a ‘disproportionately high loss of life’.A fire safety engineer said there was ‘a culture of non-compliance’ at the tower during its £9million refurbishment and its maintenance by a council-appointed body.The failures allowed the fire to engulf the building at a rate never seen before.          Horrified onlookers watch as the blaze tore through Grenfell Tower. Some can be seen taking pictures at the flames raged          Catastrophic: Grenfell Tower is engulfed in flames as the fire spreads rapidly around the block But despite the terrifying speed of the fire’s spread, families in the high rise were told to ‘stay put’ and await rescue in a fire brigade policy that may have cost lives.Experts told the inquiry the policy had ‘effectively failed’ within 30 minutes of the first 999 call. Despite this, it was not formally abandoned until almost two hours after the blaze broke out.The public inquiry revealed shocking photographs showing the devastation at Flat 16, where the fire broke out on the fourth floor, and a recording of the first 999 call.The five expert reports revealed:Cladding installed during the refurbishment contained a flammable plastic that gave the fire a ‘fuel source’It did not comply with building regulations and no full-scale tests had been carried out before it was installedFire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing prevented the fire jumping between levelsIneffective fire doors failed after just 20 minutes instead of an hourWindows were not fire-resistant, and window frames were surrounded by combustible plasticThe building’s only stairwell filled with smoke after ventilation systems failed and doors were blocked open by firefighters’ hoses and – in one case – a dead bodyFirefighters did not tackle the kitchen fire that sparked the blaze until four minutes after it had spread up the outside claddingWater supply systems in the block, installed for firefighters’ hoses, could not meet demandThe ‘stay put’ policy began to fail 21 minutes after the first 999 call, but was kept for two hours.The inquiry has heard heart-breaking evidence from families who lost relatives in the inferno.The inquiry’s lead lawyer, Richard Millett QC, said survivors and the bereaved were left with ‘an abiding sense of injustice, betrayal and marginalisation, leading to an overwhelming question: Why?’.He said the inquiry – the largest of its kind in British legal history – would ‘lay bare the truth’.He said Grenfell Tower’s refurbishment had ‘created an intolerable fire hazard’ and called the cladding on the outside of the building ‘a catastrophic failure’.Authorities believed any fire inside would be limited to the flat where it broke out, and were caught out by the ‘unprecedented’ speed and ferocity of the blaze.Mr Millett made thinly veiled criticisms of the firms and public bodies involved in the tower’s construction, refurbishment and maintenance – all of which have been asked to provide written statements. It was owned by Kensington and Chelsea council and run by its tenant management group.In a statement, London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton said: ‘I have never seen a building where the whole of it was on fire. Nobody has ever seen that.‘It was incredible, it was so alien to anything I have ever seen.’ Firefighters arrived six minutes after the first 999 call at 12.54am, but did not enter the kitchen of Flat 16 until 1.14am or begin fighting the fire until 1.20am, by which time it had burned through the new windows’ flammable uPVC frames and lit the exterior cladding."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/00/0653ED37000003E8-5805875-image-a-61_1528155985491.jpg","title":"World Cup host Gary Lineker says just corrupt Russia","story":"    Lineker will lead BBC Sport’s coverage of the World Cup, which begins next Thursday          Vladimir Putin\u0027s World Cup has been mired in controversy from security fears to corruption scandalsSocceroos star, 25, is forced to put honeymoon with his...Lily Allen wears gold AK-47 necklace as she performs at...Pubs across Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags from World Cup...Share this article    The World Cup kicks off later this month with hundreds of thousands of fans descending on Russia          The 57-year-old also dismissed fears that England fans will be targeted by Russian hooligans"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/00/4C69EA2300000578-0-image-m-41_1526686486537.jpg","title":"BBC newsreader Tina Daheley says theres bias lighter skinned Asian black celebrities","story":"    BBC newsreader Tina Daheley, the daughter of first-generation immigrant parents, claimed Asian or black women are more likely to get ahead if they have lighter skinAlongside a link, she tweeted: ‘As someone of Asian heritage with dark skin, I can tell you that light-skin privilege is REAL’.The piece, which she described as ‘great’, explored whether black women with lighter skin were more likely to succeed because of ‘colourism’ in the music and film industry.It comes after Matthew Knowles, singer Beyonce’s father, said the music world was prejudiced against black singers with darker skin.

They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor.

He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/16/4CE0B89700000578-0-image-m-3_1528041365647.jpg","title":"Lily Allen wears AK 47 necklace performs Londons Hoopla Festival","story":"The pop star, who is staging a come back with a new album, was seen wearing the pendant as she performed at the Mighty Hoopla Festival in Brockwell Park in London on Sunday eveningSemi-professional boxer Oluwafemi Omosuyi, known as Femi, was gunned down outside Oliver Goldsmith Primary in Peckham, south London, on Saturday night.The shooting took place just three miles away from the festival.Dramatic moment knife-wielding man is shot near the altar of...\u0027I want to kill a white person\u0027: Dramatic moment armed...Mother\u0027s two young children watch in horror as she is shot...West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini and his wife are mugged...Share this articleHe was blasted with a shotgun in the upper body and received pellet wounds to the face just before 8pm on Wodehouse Avenue, sparking an armed police response. In a gruesome video crowds of onlookers hover over a man, believed to be Mr Omosuyi, with blood gushing from his face.It is unclear if Ms Allen\u0027s necklace was a comment on the violence or merely a fashion statement.

Mr Omosuyi, known as Femi, had recently come back from training in Dublin when he was gunned down outside Oliver Goldsmith Primary in Peckham, south London, last nightSterling said the new design of an M16 assault rifle is actually a tribute to his late father.The 23-year-old insisted it reflects a vow he made to \u0027never touch a gun\u0027 after his father was shot dead in Kingston, Jamaica, when he was just two years old.But some activists have described the artwork as \u0027an absolute disgrace\u0027 and since called for the 23-year-old to be dropped from England\u0027s World Cup squad. Meanwhile, Ms Allen is set to release her new album later this month after a three-year music hiatus. Her stage performance comes after she admitted to cheating on ex husband Sam Cooper after struggling with fame and her identity after having children.The London native told Vulture that she blames some of her  personal troubles on her comeback to music in 2014.She added that it was during her time away from the spotlight to focus on motherhood that she lost control of her image, but now feels she is turning back towards her best.

chance","story":"    Inferno: Grenfell Tower in flames last year after a fire started in the tower block in Kensington1 There is no statutory requirement for central alarm systems in tower blocks because it would conflict with the policy of residents ‘staying put’ in flats.2 No sprinklers.3 Firefighters should have directed their hoses on or above the fire, but videos show they were being targeted below.4 A pipe system to get water up the 24-storey block could not cope and was overloaded – leaving the upper floors, where most people died, vulnerable.5 Water pipe failure meant fire crews had to pump their own water onto the fire.6 The failure of the fire lift system delayed firefighters.7 Advice for residents to stay put in the event of a fire was futile within half an hour of the blaze breaking out – but still slavishly adhered to for another 80 minutes.8 Combustible cladding panels and insulation systems were ruled ‘substantially to blame’.9 Two types of cladding and four different insulation layers did not comply with building regulations.10 Two cavity barriers did not have the required fire performance certificates.11 The cladding produced toxic smoke that slowed the firefighters as it forced them to wear breathing apparatus.12 Designers and builders had no idea how the cladding system would perform in a fire as no tests were carried out.13 Neither the London Fire Brigade nor Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which was responsible for Grenfell, carried out risk assessments of the cladding.14 Flammable aluminium panels fixed to the tower and on more than 300 other blocks across England were never subjected to a full British Standard fire test.15 Stairwell was too narrow and soon became impassable thanks to smoke, darkness, firefighters and distressed and dying victims.16 An architectural feature called a ‘crown’ at the top of the building caught fire and also helped the blaze spread horizontally.17 Design of tower blocks is supposed to ‘compartmentalise’ fires into inidual flats – but this was not effective at Grenfell.18 Ventilation system for removing smoke from lobbies failed.19 Fire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing stopped the blaze leaping up the tower.20 A ‘culture of non-compliance’ appeared to exist in the maintenance of the tower.21 Most of the fire doors leading to the 120 flats were relatively new but did not comply with building regulations.22 Some doors failed within 20 minutes even though they should have blocked fire for an hour.23 Doors were fitted with a variety of different locks, hinges and letter plates that could significantly reduce fire resistance.24 Forty-eight doors had glazing that failed and allowed flames and smoke to pass directly through.25 Fourteen of the doors to Grenfell’s flats were of unknown origin.26 Some doors designed to ‘self-close’ failed to do so, allowing the fire to spread more quickly.27 Doors were left open by fire hoses and in one case, a body.28 Defective windows installed in the 2012-16 refurbishment allowed the fire to spread from a single kitchen to the external cladding through gaps in frames.29 Windows had no fire-resistant cavity barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material.30 During refurbishment, the windows were fitted in an ‘improvised manner’ that may have made them less safe.    Five experts deliver their verdict on blaze that left 72 deadBy Vanessa Allen and Arthur Martin for The Daily MailBasic flaws with the cladding at Grenfell Tower and an extraordinary litany of fire safety failings caused the inferno that claimed 72 lives, it was revealed yesterday.On the first day of formal evidence at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, a devastating report found the cladding was ‘substantially to blame’ for fuelling a blaze that leapt 19 floors in just 12 minutes.Its flammable plastic core helped fuel the fire and produced toxic smoke that slowed firefighters, while its design contributed to the ‘catastrophic’ spread of the flames.  How the fire spread: What began as a fire in a single apartment at Grenfell Tower (left) quickly spread (right)The report was just one of five presented to the inquiry yesterday, outlining an incredible catalogue of failures encompassing virtually every aspect of fire safety at the block in Kensington, west London.Almost all elements of fire safety at the tower failed – from dangerous fire doors and windows to firefighters who inadvertently helped the flames to spread – leading to a ‘disproportionately high loss of life’.A fire safety engineer said there was ‘a culture of non-compliance’ at the tower during its £9million refurbishment and its maintenance by a council-appointed body.The failures allowed the fire to engulf the building at a rate never seen before.          Horrified onlookers watch as the blaze tore through Grenfell Tower. Some can be seen taking pictures at the flames raged          Catastrophic: Grenfell Tower is engulfed in flames as the fire spreads rapidly around the block But despite the terrifying speed of the fire’s spread, families in the high rise were told to ‘stay put’ and await rescue in a fire brigade policy that may have cost lives.Experts told the inquiry the policy had ‘effectively failed’ within 30 minutes of the first 999 call. Despite this, it was not formally abandoned until almost two hours after the blaze broke out.The public inquiry revealed shocking photographs showing the devastation at Flat 16, where the fire broke out on the fourth floor, and a recording of the first 999 call.The five expert reports revealed:Cladding installed during the refurbishment contained a flammable plastic that gave the fire a ‘fuel source’It did not comply with building regulations and no full-scale tests had been carried out before it was installedFire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing prevented the fire jumping between levelsIneffective fire doors failed after just 20 minutes instead of an hourWindows were not fire-resistant, and window frames were surrounded by combustible plasticThe building’s only stairwell filled with smoke after ventilation systems failed and doors were blocked open by firefighters’ hoses and – in one case – a dead bodyFirefighters did not tackle the kitchen fire that sparked the blaze until four minutes after it had spread up the outside claddingWater supply systems in the block, installed for firefighters’ hoses, could not meet demandThe ‘stay put’ policy began to fail 21 minutes after the first 999 call, but was kept for two hours.The inquiry has heard heart-breaking evidence from families who lost relatives in the inferno.The inquiry’s lead lawyer, Richard Millett QC, said survivors and the bereaved were left with ‘an abiding sense of injustice, betrayal and marginalisation, leading to an overwhelming question: Why?’.He said the inquiry – the largest of its kind in British legal history – would ‘lay bare the truth’.He said Grenfell Tower’s refurbishment had ‘created an intolerable fire hazard’ and called the cladding on the outside of the building ‘a catastrophic failure’.Authorities believed any fire inside would be limited to the flat where it broke out, and were caught out by the ‘unprecedented’ speed and ferocity of the blaze.Mr Millett made thinly veiled criticisms of the firms and public bodies involved in the tower’s construction, refurbishment and maintenance – all of which have been asked to provide written statements. It was owned by Kensington and Chelsea council and run by its tenant management group.In a statement, London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton said: ‘I have never seen a building where the whole of it was on fire. Nobody has ever seen that.‘It was incredible, it was so alien to anything I have ever seen.’ Firefighters arrived six minutes after the first 999 call at 12.54am, but did not enter the kitchen of Flat 16 until 1.14am or begin fighting the fire until 1.20am, by which time it had burned through the new windows’ flammable uPVC frames and lit the exterior cladding."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/00/0653ED37000003E8-5805875-image-a-61_1528155985491.jpg","title":"World Cup host Gary Lineker says just corrupt Russia","story":"    Lineker will lead BBC Sport’s coverage of the World Cup, which begins next Thursday          Vladimir Putin\u0027s World Cup has been mired in controversy from security fears to corruption scandalsSocceroos star, 25, is forced to put honeymoon with his...Lily Allen wears gold AK-47 necklace as she performs at...Pubs across Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags from World Cup...Share this article    The World Cup kicks off later this month with hundreds of thousands of fans descending on Russia          The 57-year-old also dismissed fears that England fans will be targeted by Russian hooligans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd72de49c25689edaf925eefc10536009f342747/0_230_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801a69e63a10689f2a8154ace455d858","title":"its been my whole life alan and his photobooths a picture essay","story":"The famous photobooth at Flinders Street station in Melbourne has been the centre of one family’s life.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

Pumping and heating is used later to turn it back to a gas, which is released to turn a turbine, generating electricity at times of need – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions.While relatively small at 5 megawatts (MW) compared to 50MW lithium-ion battery facilities being built by firms such as EDF Energy, Highview Power said the technology could be scaled up to hundreds of megawatts.Gareth Brett, the company’s chief executive, said the technology could timeshift energy across the day, with the firm buying electricity when cheap and releasing it when prices are higher.“If you only want to store energy for an hour, lithium-ion is fine but the reality is what people are looking to do is store excess renewable power and release it at peak times, which is usually four hours or more,” he said.Brett admitted the liquid air process is less efficient than storing electricity in batteries but pointed out that the storage does not degrade over time, as lithium-ion cells do.Highview Power is already exploring sites for a much larger, 50MW storage facility and pitches the fact it can be located anywhere as one of its selling points. The firm has opened a US office and is also eyeing export opportunities in mainland Europe and Australia.The 690-square metre Bury facility officially opens on Tuesday, funded with £8m of government money and £25m of private investment. However, Brett said the technology was ready for commercialisation and could succeed with subsidy.Large-scale energy storage is seen as increasingly vital to help the National Grid and local energy networks cope with the fast-growing levels of renewables, whose output varies depending on the amount of wind and sunshine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f450c064c13bd63c7fdf659c8ce7571145ce38/90_134_3309_1985/master/3309.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59bbb07ef881136710452bc923908d2a","title":"sunshine and a royal wedding spark british spending spree in may","story":"Retail sales grew at highest rate in four years but experts warn uplift may be short-livedRetailers had one of their best months in recent years in May as warm weather and the royal wedding tempted consumers back into the shops.However, amid evidence that the construction sector is being hit by the spate of high street store closures, the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, warned that the outlook for retailers remained tough. Almost 6,000 shops closed in 2017 – the highest since the economy was emerging from the deep recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008-09 – and well-known brands including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser are planning further closures this year.“Retail sales in May saw their highest growth since January 2014 as better weather and the bank holiday effect led shoppers to buy from garden furniture and summer fashion ranges recovering some of the ground lost in April,” Dickinson said. “Food sales also stood out, with the best single month’s performance since July 2013.”Dickinson said: “Despite this more positive set of sales results, the retail environment remains extremely challenging, with trend growth still very low by historical standards.”Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail, said: “Two bank holiday weekends, a royal wedding and of course sunnier spells will have been the main drivers behind the apparent rebound, with both online and high street sales thankfully up overall.”While the construction industry continued to stage a modest recovery in May after bad weather earlier in 2018, reduced demand from struggling retailers was one reason cited in the latest IHS MarkitCIPS purchasing managers survey for the fourth decline in new orders in five months.The reading on the IHS MarkitCIPS construction purchasing managers’ index remained steady at 52.5 points in May, against economists’ forecasts for a slight decline in activity from the previous month. Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, cautioned that a renewed drop in new work “hinted that the recovery could prove short-lived”.Spending on experiences such as music festivals and sporting events would remain strong over the coming months, the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e247dc52aee872e97dfaac6d8d8976257ce814/0_21_3675_2207/master/3675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d82b133cf07c6be71bce4f3ef3b2b08","title":"tech giants amazon facebook","story":"The power of corporate giants like Amazon and Facebook is unparalleled. A regulatory assault seems urgent, inevitable – and impossibleThe most memorable parts of last year’s Conservative election manifesto were the ones Theresa May would rather forget. History will immortalise her social care reform as a voter-repellent “dementia tax”. The offer to give MPs a free vote on the hunting ban is a case study in how to alienate the biggest number of people with the fewest words. With such a circus of electoral self-sabotage, it is hardly surprising that one of the more interesting manifesto pledges went largely unnoticed. The Tories promised to clean up the internet: “Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology … We disagree.”Not so long ago, regulating the internet was thought to be senseless. It was undesirable because the ethos of the digital age – a Californian love child of hippy liberalism and ultra-capitalism – venerated freedom. And it was impossible because the fluid character of the web would flow around clumsy analogue statecraft.That was before the Chinese Communist party demonstrated that a government with sufficient disregard for democracy could curtail a citizen’s online exploration. It was also before the wide-open savannahs of the western web were conquered by corporate giants: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple. This tetrarchy – the Gafa – has a collective influence over the economic and social lives of hundreds of millions of people unparalleled in human history. It is not just the companies’ financial scale that boggles the mind (they are\u0026nbspcompeting to be the first company valued at a trillion dollars) but the intimacy of their reach. They know your place, your purchases, your politics and your most personal proclivities.When May speaks of regulating the internet she has in mind social ills conducted over the network: terrorist recruitment, paedophilia, hate speech. But any government’s ability to fix those things requires negotiation with the companies that own the platforms on which the wicked trade is done. The balance of power then depends on the credibility of a politician’s threat to sanction a business, which is a function of jurisdiction and market size. That is why Mark\u0026nbspZuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has testified before the US Congress and taken questions from the European parliament, but ignores invitations by the Commons committee investigating data misuse in political campaigns. He cares what US and EU regulators might do. The UK doesn’t even know what its regulatory framework will be after Brexit. (And London will be copying and pasting templates set in Brussels for years to come.)Even without the problem of border-less commerce, governments struggle to police their national patches of internet because some digital offences evade precise definition. Moderators struggle to distinguish, for example, between a racist post and a sarcastic post lampooning racists. It gets harder still when the mechanism for identifying malicious intent or distinguishing between truth and falsehood is automated. The sheer volume of content to be vetted requires algorithmic surveillance, which grants extraordinary powers to the programmers tasked with encoding moral boundaries.Google is this week due to publish the ethical framework it uses in its application of artificial intelligence. This is meant to reassure us that the company is not striding into a dystopian future without any consideration of potentially sinister applications of its algorithms. (Given that it has previously helped the Pentagon develop AI systems for drone warfare, that reassurance is going to be a tough sell.)At Facebook a “content standards forum” convenes every fortnight to discuss the boundaries of acceptable discourse in the Kingdom of Zuck. It is an improvisatory process. The group had to invent a “newsworthiness” exemption to cover one of the most famous images in the history of war photography. Nick Ut’s picture of Vietnamese children fleeing a napalm strike had been blocked because it featured a naked young girl.Zuckerberg has speculated that his site might one day need something like a “supreme court” to adjudicate filth and fair comment. That sounds bombastic, but few of the other options are very appealing. It is easy to outlaw bad behaviour. Most of what people can easily agree is offensive material online is in any case already illegal offline. The difficulty comes when thousands of marginal cases have to be judged every minute. Or when every candidate in an election decides hostile press coverage is “fake news”. Is the job of arbitration then best done by a robot, a company employee or a civil servant? None seem obviously qualified.A regulatory assault on the Gafa seems simultaneously urgent, inevitable and impossible. But these are still early days in the transformation of politics by technology. Or, rather, we must now be at the end of the phase where technology companies can pretend to be just businesses. It is inconceivable that entities in command of so much wealth and power – in control of an infrastructure that is instrumental to the routine interactions and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people – are anything other than political.If they had geographical boundaries they would be nations. Instead they are virtual empires with capabilities that intrude deep into national jurisdictions, rivalling the power of local elites. That has been a guaranteed formula for confrontation throughout history. There is no reason to expect it will be different this time, for all that we cannot yet imagine how such a battle is even fought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60844ff4bc985ae798a82520e8b724199acf2025/0_93_2845_1707/master/2845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8abd940813d7d2a69607c122fc9d267","title":"the world bobby kennedy hoped for isnt here yet we need to try harder","story":"Robert Kennedy believed change starts with the actions of a single person, and if enough people join, they can bend historyMost politicians have a political hero. Someone they look up to. Someone they wish they were half as good as.Mine died 50 years ago this week. Murdered in a kitchen in a Californian hotel.His dad called him a runt. His enemies called him ruthless. His brother called him Black Robert. We know him as Bobby.When he died so did the dream of Camelot restored, of another Kennedy in the White House. But Bobby wasn’t just another Kennedy. He was different from his famous brother.For a start, he was shorter. But he was also tougher. Jack wrote a book about political courage. Bobby had it in spades. He took on everyone from Jimmy Hoffa to the mafia to white segregationists. He also had a clearer moral compass than his older brother. When the world was on the brink of nuclear war for 13 days in October 1962, it was Bobby who convinced his brother not to bomb Cuba. With the memories of Pearl Harbour still fresh, he told JFK that America didn’t launch sneak attacks. The president took his advice and it probably averted a nuclear war. It was also Bobby who urged him to act on civil rights.When his brother died, Bobby could have crawled up in a ball, never to be seen again. But he didn’t do that. Instead he used his fame and his name to shine a light on the darkest parts of America. On poverty and prejudice. On children dying of hunger in the richest country in the world. On the plight of migrant farm workers who picked but didn’t share in the national bounty and on what he called “a national disgrace” – the desperate deprivation endured by Native Americans. At a time when America was tearing itself apart over a war it was losing in Vietnam and black and white Americans were fighting in the streets at home, Bobby Kennedy also tried to bring people together. If you haven’t seen it, watch the speech he made in Indianapolis on the night Martin Luther King died. No other white man could have made that speech. That night, fires burned in more than 60 cities across America, but Indianapolis was quiet. Like any politician, he made mistakes. A big one was the decision he made when he was attorney general to tap Martin Luther King’s phone. He also admitted that the war he tried to end in Vietnam, he had also helped to start. And, like most politicians, he was ambitious – but he was ambitious with a purpose. In South Africa in 1966, in the depths of apartheid, he told a group of university students: “Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.” That pretty much sums up Bobby Kennedy. He believed change starts with the actions of a single person and that if enough people do the same thing, they can bend history.The world he hoped for isn’t here. Apartheid has gone, but poverty and prejudice are still here. The ide between rich and poor and black and white still exists – and not just in America. That doesn’t mean he was wrong. It just means we need to try harder.We will never know what would have happened if Bobby Kennedy hadn’t walked through that kitchen 50 years ago, whether he would have won the Democratic nomination, whether he would have become president or even whether he would have been any good. But I do know we need more people like Bobby Kennedy. Not just in politics. Everywhere. More people trying to bring us together. More people willing to act to improve the lives of others. More people seeking what Lord Tennyson called “a newer world”. More tiny ripples of hope.• Jason Clare MP, member for Blaxland, is shadow minister for trade and investment, and shadow minister for resources and northern Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b526148c33626d62c4b8db9a3ca65207118e6ca5/0_315_4815_2889/4815.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd204d503aa07ac68dccde896cdabee1","title":"what to do in toronto a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A year-round cultural buzz from the film festival, plus amazing architecture and a huge history of ethnic ersity mean there’s a lot to be seen, done and eaten in the Ontarian capital. Get the best of ‘Canada’s downtown’ with a two-day itinerary from local writer Jim ByersMorningStart with a tour of the city’s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historianman-about-town Bruce Bell will show you interesting views of the St. Lawrence Market (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) – and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel Bakery. For about £4 (C$7), you’ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at Uno Mustachio. Want something more formal? The highly rated Biagio is nearby.AfternoonFrom the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There’s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that’s your thing.EveningStop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at Mill Street Brew Pub. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you’re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at Balzac’s (open ’til 8pm) – grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include Corktown Designs (nice jewellery) and John Fluevog for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, El Catrin restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.MorningTry breakfast at Over Easy, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to Dineen, just a few blocks north.To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the Toronto Islands also allows you the park experience plus a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward’s Island. There’s a legal nude beach at Hanlan’s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.AfternoonSome visitors hit the heights at the CN Tower (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it’s best to enjoy the view after you’ve seen a bit and know what you’re looking at. You can try the Edge Walk and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.Kensington Market is one of the city’s other iconic sights. It’s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it’s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and CentralSouth American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at Rasta Pasta for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try Amadeu’s for a taste of Portugal.EveningA drink on the Ritz-Carlton terrace is in order. It’s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is the Wheat Sheaf, billed as Toronto’s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, Rhum Corner has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city’s “hippest” street. Boralia makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605). Grab a gourmet ice cream sandwich at Bang Bang Ice Cream to finish your night.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9782b4c2e169ab67c091ca14a0315538c2b5ea0f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb344b738bfdeb0a74dd95b3f74ff8","title":"a fashion lovers guide to canada","story":"Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …What I knew about Canada before I embarked on my one-week, three-city trip this summer was limited to a handful of sources: 90s TV show North of 60, Drake songs (which can arguably be seen as a Toronto guidebook written by its most famous resident), and the work of iconic brands such as Roots and Herschel.What I didn’t know was that by the time I left, I’d have discovered one of the most talented crops of local makers and designers anywhere in the world, eaten the best tacos of my life, and experienced a view – on the summit of Vancouver’s Howe Sound – that made me feel insignificant in the best possible way. And that’s to say nothing of the incredible people I met – and the raw energy of the country’s erse, accepting and multicultural cities. Canada really is a place without barriers – somewhere no one could feel like an outsider.I arrived in Toronto with high expectations and I can honestly say that they were surpassed. World-class boutiques, killer vintage finds and an unmistakable big town buzz. This is a city that has its pulse on contemporary fashion.Ice cream and being seen on Queen Street WestQueen Street West is Toronto’s creative and fashion hub – and somewhere that’s been on my radar since Vogue crowned it one of the world’s top three hippest neighbourhoods in 2014. It’s easy to see why. Not only is it home to high-end destination boutiques, such as Nomad, but it’s also a platform for Toronto’s homegrown talent – there are a lot of independent boutiques supporting each other in this prime location.I discovered local makers such as YNOT and Kotn, who are representing everything that’s great about contemporary Toronto as a city and Canada as a country with their designs. YNOT’s sturdy, stylish rucksacks and hardwearing jackets call to mind how connected to nature you are in Canada – even in the middle of its biggest city – while Kotn’s clean and elegant basics represent luxury in its simplest form.If you’re looking to mix local selections with high-end international pieces, head to Nomad – the boutique stocks an excellent range of powerhouse names such as Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. My top Queen Street West tip? Take a long stroll, heading west to east, with an ice cream in hand from iHalo Krunch.Vintage finds in Kensington MarketIf you love vintage, there’s nowhere better than Kensington Market. This hip, colourful neighbourhood near downtown Toronto has a plethora of stores packed with wonderful finds. It has an amazing sense of street life too: turn any corner and you’ll find bars with small outdoor performance spaces, full of drinkers enjoying a show in the sun, or – as I did – dining at truly quirky restaurants, such as Rasta Pasta, the home of Jamaican-Italian fusion.Seeing where the magic happens at the Roots factoryRoots is probably the quintessential Canadian brand. Again, the strong connection to nature comes through in what it produces. Roots has been part of pop culture for years, yet still manages to feel current – proved by its recent collaboration with Drake. The rapper had a range of varsity jackets for his OVO label co-produced with the brand.I had the chance to visit the factory, which was fascinating from my perspective as a tailor and designer, to get an insight into its production processes. One thing is for sure: they really know their leather. It was also great to understand who makes it and why. Walking into the factory, you see flags everywhere, representing all of the different nations Roots’ employees come from. It really reflects Canada’s multicultural vibe – people bring their own roots to Roots.Cool Canadiana at Drake General StoreJust across the street from the Drake Hotel on Queen West, Drake General Store is like a souvenir shop for people who wouldn’t normally buy souvenirs. It’s a stylish space full of considered Canadiana, where all of the products have a curated feel – from the beautiful Alberta-made blanket I picked up, to the artisan maple syrup I brought for my friend who runs a cafe back home in south London. If you’re only visiting Toronto but want to get a sense of the whole of Canada, it’s the place to go.New architecture and timeless art at the Art Gallery of OntarioI was really excited to see the recent Frank Gehry extension of the Art Gallery of Ontario it’s a stunning addition to an already stunning building. Inside, I got to see some of the fantastic work by the Group of Seven – a group of Canadian landscape painters who initiated Canada’s first major national art movement.Fring’s by name, fring by natureNamed and frequented by Drake, Fring’s delivers a unique fusion of Asian and soul food under the stewardship of Canadian celebrity chef Susur Lee. Fring’s derives its name from Canadian-Caribbean patois, translating roughly to “good times remembered” – and after one meal here I’ve got no reservations in saying that the moniker fits. It’s an intimate space with a first-rate interior fit out, and the Hong Kong chicken and waffles with maple chili glaze were unforgettable.If only I’d had more than two days in Montreal. It’s a city unlike any other – a perfect blend of European charm and North American hustle. It’s also a place for those who love the finer things in life: amazing food, slick bars and very stylish people.Mont RoyalThe size and scale of the green spaces in Canada’s cities is something that I still struggle to get my head around – Montreal’s Mont Royal, also known as Mount Royal, is no exception. The vista over the city from the highest point of the park takes in all of downtown Montreal, while the walking route back downhill towards Saint-Laurent offers a great view of the nine-storey Leonard Cohen mural keeping watch over his old borough.Sheer ‘jeanius’ at Naked \u0026amp Famous DenimBrandon Svarc is a denim genius. Producing jeans under his Naked \u0026amp Famous moniker, he’s a maker who knows his product so well that he can stretch it to its limits – whether its dyeing jeans in green tea or red wine, or producing the heaviest pair of jeans in the world out of 32oz Japanese selvedge denim. The Naked \u0026amp Famous factory is right on top of the store. The denim gets made on the third floor and is sold downstairs in the Tate \u0026amp Yoko boutique.My idea of heaven at Maison CloakroomI wasn’t expecting this: a premium men’s tailoring retailer with its own speakeasy. In other words, something like my idea of heaven. Maison Cloakroom is housed in a beautiful 19th-century townhouse on Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal. This place sums up that distinctive Montreal feel – old and new, European and American – more than anywhere else in the city.Meeting the makers at Lowell MTLLowell MTL may take its name from the region of Massachusetts that was once home to a large population of French Canadians (Jack Kerouac the most famous of them), but it is a Montreal brand to the core – all of its products take inspiration from locations in and around the city. Mathieu Mudie and Rachel Fortin, the husband and wife team behind Lowell MTL, made the brand’s name producing premium leather accessories, but they have since expanded into stylish men’s and women’s clothing ranges.The ultimate Reuben at Dunn’s FamousYou can’t leave Montreal without trying a classic smoked meat sandwich from one of the city’s famous delis. As with any local specialty, there’s always hot debate about who does the best, but it’s hard to imagine anywhere outdoing the full-fat, classic Reuben at Dunn’s Famous – a sandwich piled impossibly high with Dunn’s famous smoked brisket, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island sauce.Returning the favour at LovSometimes you just stumble upon one of the best places in town. That’s what happened with Lov. We found this place after taking a wrong turn en route to another restaurant. But it only took one look at what was coming out of the kitchen to convince us to stay – smart, innovative vegetarian dishes just asking to be washed down with one of Lov’s signature botanical cocktails. So good we returned the following night.By now I should have been used to just how close to nature you are in any Canadian city, but Vancouver takes it up a notch: from downtown you can be right on the water in 15 minutes walk. It’s something you can feel with the relaxed, west coast attitude of the people, and something that really comes through in the work of local makers Herschel and Dayton Boots, who have put Vancouver on the world style map.Colour and craftsmanship at the Museum of AnthropologySet deep in the leafy campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology is home to a vast collection of indigenous artworks and cultural artefacts. I was lucky enough to have met Haida designer and artist Dorothy Grant at her home and studio before my visit – she gave me a real understanding of the varying colours and shapes used by different tribes. Seeing the level of craftsmanship on the totems, masks, garments and weaves on display up close was an experience I will never forget.Revolutionary fabrics at HerschelIt’s great to see such a young brand doing what it does so confidently. Herschel bags have made their mark so strongly as a street style staple since 2009 that, for me, they’ve become virtually synonymous with the idea of a rucksack. As a tailor, it was fascinating to see the work that the brand is doing in producing its own materials, such as the ApexKnit: a groundbreaking new fabric from which its makers are able to produce a single-piece rucksack.A fine legacy at Dayton BootsDayton Boots represents so much of what is great about Vancouver’s makers and the city’s style ethos. The brand started out more than 70 years ago, making boots for loggers. Today, their product is still as sturdy and well-crafted as it was then – but like so many great workwear brands, what they produce works just as well as a contemporary look. I’d recommend taking a look for yourself – the Dayton Boots factory is open to the public and right behind their flagship store on East Hastings Street.Record shopping and more in GastownGastown is home to one of the best record shops in the city – Beat Street Records, just around the corner from Gastown’s famous Steam clock.I’m a lover of jazz, funk and hip-hop and was blown away by the selections: among them releases by J-Dilla and Slum Village that I’d never come across in London, and hard-to-come-by rarities by Thelonious Monk and a load of other jazz greats. Of course, record shops aren’t the only thing you’ll find in Gastown. It’s a neighbourhood that has long been considered the spot for fine eating and drinking in Vancouver. Try Bao Down for some of Vancouver’s best Asian fusion street food.No more tacos after TacofinoAnd then there was Tacofino. What can I say about this place, other than is sells simply the finest tacos I’ve ever eaten. They were so good that I haven’t been able to find anything close since returning to London – it just feels like we’re not doing it right. But it’s not just the tacos – Tacofino also distinguishes itself with west coast-inspired ceviche, tostadas and nachos, as well as the phenomenal chilli salt wings with lime and valentina.The view to end all views, from the Sea to Sky GondolaIf you’re going to Vancouver, you have to take the Sea to Sky Gondola. It takes you over some of the most incredible natural scenery I saw in Canada, and it’s all less than an hour’s drive away from the city centre. The view from the summit was awe-inspiring, and many of the hiking trails coursing up the ascent were easily walkable for a beginner like me. It’s one of those places that makes you and your problems feel small – and all the better for it.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canadaPhotography: Momme Halbe and Taryn Paterson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8d5ce6acc157e29cfa438af9da789a83c9c3070/500_937_7323_4393/master/7323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a801e9d5c5a26cee150f9c1d689964f9","title":"grammar schools bbc documentary divisive","story":"BBC2’s new series surely puts a further dent in Theresa May’s plans to expand selective educationI suspect I am not the only person who felt beamed into some alien universe watching the first episode of Grammar Schools: Who Will Get In?, BBC2’s mini-series focusing on the transfer to secondary school in the selective borough of Bexley.Are there really parts of erse, metropolitan London in 2018 in which primary-age children are put through the 11-plus test? Who could not be haunted by the silent tears of Jaenita’s mother, who works at Poundland and has spent hundreds of pounds a month for years on test tuition, only to see her plucky, articulate daughter fear herself “a failure in life”?Parts two and three of the series will concentrate on the secondary school years, particularly the run-up to GCSEs, with Erith secondary modern struggling with a minority of disruptive students and severe teacher shortages in science, while Townley grammar has the pick of highly qualified staff.It’s riveting drama. But what most strikes me is the subtle way that broadcasters have changed their approach to this isive subject. A 2006 BBC documentary about Joe Prentis, a Birmingham boy going through the 11-plus nightmare, was much less critical about the process, happy to describe families “seeking refuge” in a grammar school at a time of “failing standards”.In 2012, I was part of a group that made a complaint to the BBC about its documentary Grammar Schools: A Secret History, a rosily nostalgic view of postwar selection that saluted the grammar schools of old. We didn’t succeed with our complaint but we gave the BBC a run for its taxpayers’ money in terms of the politics of misrepresentation.So why does this series feel a bit different in tone and content? It’s partly that television has extended its reach in the intervening years, with popular programmes such as Educating Essex and Educating Yorkshire, which have brought so many brilliant heads, teachers and young people into sympathetic view. There’s more than a hint of “Educating Bexley” about the new series. More generally, as a society, we’ve developed a keener understanding of the emotional component of learning – so there’s much less of the stiff BBC upper lip about 11-plus failure and more of a sense of the damaging effect of the test throughout secondary education – and not just on those who have failed.But the shift is partly down to politics. Theresa May’s rash decision in 2016 to put selection back on the agenda has angered and worried parents and teachers and united the educational world against her plans. A string of academic studies have undermined the old myths of the grammar lobby, still repeated here by Townley grammar’s headteacher, who says his job is “talent spotting” and seems to believe that selection is not a problem for neighbouring schools, and that clever teenagers can only achieve if segregated from most of their peers.In taking a broader, and powerfully human, view of the impact of selection, Grammar Schools: Who Will Get In? will surely put a further dent in government plans to expand grammar schools. Only in the final episode – when too much time is given over to the self justifications of Townley’s smooth-talking head – does it feel as if the programme makers lose their nerve. By then, I suspect, it is too late. Most viewers will already have made up their mind about this rotten system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c829830416e75ba155a003e98e533b1251a18009/491_186_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6174efee3a929c122ce57c174626d89","title":"rachel de souza vomit school controversy ofsted","story":"The newspapers couldn’t believe their luck. Last autumn, Barry Smith, headteacher of the new Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, issued policies on behaviour to parents and children. The predecessor school, he wrote, was riddled with indiscipline, bullying and truancy. He would not allow such things. Mobile phones, if seen or heard, would be confiscated for weeks. Pupils must “only ever look at your teacher or where your teacher has directed you to look”. Smith specified “unacceptable” boys’ haircuts including “variations on the style often known as ‘Meet me at McDonald’s’”, a tousled mop with short sides.Most remarkably, he told children not to feign illness to avoid work. “If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! … that’s probably all your body wanted.” After press headlines and angry parents’ protests, Smith modified his “behaviour guide”, parts of which were “tongue in cheek”, with the sick buckets being just “a colourful turn of phrase”.For Dame Rachel de Souza, founder and chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, the chain that runs the academy, the storm was just a routine day’s work. For a small (14 schools) chain, founded in 2013, the trust attracts disproportionate publicity. Some of it is positive. Though several schools required improvement or were in special measures before they joined, the Department for Education puts Inspiration second only to a chain that includes two grammar schools in a league table of multi-academy trusts’ Progress 8 scores. A study by the Education Policy Institute rates its key stage 4 results ahead of every other secondary provider in England, including local authorities. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, was so impressed with De Souza, a steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, that he said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”.De Souza points out that it’s normal for schools to be shown draft Ofsted reports and for inspectors to make second visits after representations. Ministers, in any case, have no power to influence school inspections. So why does she attract so much controversy? “Probably because I think change is necessary and do things wholeheartedly,” she ventures. But several hostile stories, I observe, are based on leaked emails, which suggests she makes enemies among her colleagues. “There were a number of difficult relationships. Perhaps some people’s noses were put out of joint.”De Souza talks at 100mph sentences begin but never finish, as she interrupts herself with new thoughts and anecdotes. “I’m jumping all over the place,” she says.She taught at comprehensives in Oxford, east London and Luton before, at 36, landing her first academy headship, also in Luton. The school, replacing two local authority schools deemed to be “underperforming”, was so difficult that she told her senior team it would probably continue to fail and, at the end of the year, “we could all walk away and get on with our lives”. But for that one year, they should give it everything.“We went totally over the top on every little thing. We would tell them to do their revision and then have a banana. Revise, eat a banana, revise, eat a banana. Year 11 had never had a qualified maths teacher. So I found one and put them all in the hall with him and a stereo mic for two hours each night.” She ordered new uniforms, sent teachers to get children out of bed in the mornings, and introduced assemblies with classical music. Exam results soared.She describes the trust as “a family” with “a feeling of community”, exemplified by an annual “great day” in early September “where we get all the staff together”. Inspiration Trust, like several other academy chains, has a central team of “brilliant subject specialists” hammering out rigorous curriculum content. If a local authority were doing it, it would be described as dictatorial, particularly since there is a heavy emphasis on “core knowledge”, the latest curriculum fashion, which De Souza embraced after visiting ED Hirsch, its guru, in the US. But de Souza insists that the team works closely with teachers and that “we see ourselves as a scholarly community generating new knowledge”.Born in 1968, she had a “wonderful, colourful, interesting childhood”. Her father was Irish, her mother, half-Austrian, half-Hungarian. A Ukrainian step-grandfather encouraged her to learn the language at a Saturday school. At her Catholic school, she was a “very good” student up to 14 but became “quite sociable and not that interested in studying” until the second year at sixth form college. Her religious studies teacher had a degree from London University’s tiny Heythrop College, and De Souza decided to follow him. She met her future husband, now in the probation service, on her first day. “I thought: yes, that’s it.”With a degree in theology and philosophy, “I was advised to shake off my northern help-the-world thing and go and make some money.” She became a trainee accountant. “I thought it was the end of life.” After two weeks, she left to take a teaching certificate at King ’s College, London.Her career – five jobs in the past 15 years – suggests a certain restlessness. There were rumours in 2016 that she would succeed Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector. She laughs and denies that she applied.So what about the “vomit school”? More laughter. “What Barry’s done there is unbelievable,” she tells me. “It’s one of the best examples of sorting out behaviour I’ve ever seen. The guy is super-talented.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd5a3928c5752a489bb5cffbc102d73f2a13e5c0/0_149_1980_1188/master/1980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2f7ab58c8f68289ae2eee55c3493f6b","title":"coral decline in great barrier reef unprecedented","story":"Reef monitoring program shows northern section has lost half of its coral coverA steep decline in coral cover right across the Great Barrier Reef is a phenomenon that “has not been observed in the historical record”, a new report by the Australian Institute of Marine Science says.The institute, Australia’s government-backed marine research agency, periodically releases results of a long-term reef monitoring program. Each reef along the Queensland coast is visited by researchers every two years to assess its condition and coral cover.The latest results, released on Tuesday, detail how major bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have impacted on different sections of the reef. AIMS said it had no previous record of bleaching events occurring in successive years.“Over the 30-plus years of monitoring by AIMS, Great Barrier Reef reefs have shown their ability to recover after disturbances, but such ‘resilience’ clearly has limits,” the report says.“The predicted consequences of climate change include more powerful storms and more frequent and more intense bleaching events.“More intense disturbances mean greater damage to reefs, so recovery must take longer if the growth rate remains the same. At the same time, the intervals between acute disturbance events are decreasing and chronic stresses such as high turbidity and high ocean temperatures can slow rates of recovery.”Survey reefs in the northern section, the worst hit by climate-induced marine heatwaves, have lost about half their coral cover. The impacts of the most recent heatwave is not fully represented in the results, as the most recent AIMS surveys have been in the central and southern sections.“The geographic scale of recent bleaching means that breeding populations of corals have been decimated over large areas, reducing the potential sources of larvae to recolonise reefs over the next years,” the report says.Imogen Zethoven, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report highlighted the unprecedented scale of coral loss on the reef.“We need the government to see this as a national crisis, which it is. We are responsible for the protection and conservation of this world treasure. We have a legal and moral obligation to look after it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee5871057d629ff337881477367ac0f9a66ec857/0_0_6510_3906/master/6510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63315d35f9be745a2d47e0852e3ec5e8","title":"man begins six month swim through great pacific garbage patch","story":"Ben Lecomte hopes to make it from Japan to San Francisco in 180 days while raising awareness of plastic pollutionA French anti-plastic campaigner has begun a six-month journey to swim through the giant floating rubbish mass known as the Great Pacific garbage patch.Ben Lecomte, who has previously swum across the Atlantic Ocean in 1998, left the shores of Choshi in Japan on Tuesday morning, heading east.The 50-year-old plans to swim from Japan to San Francisco in 180 days, covering 8,000km. His journey will take him through 1,600km of the garbage patch, in an attempt to raise awareness about plastic pollution. The Great Pacific garbage patch, according to the latest March estimate, is twice the size of France and contains nearly 80,000 tonnes of plastic. Also known as the Pacific trash vortex, the patch is caused by the North Pacific gyre – a circle of currents that keep plastic, waste and other pollution trapped. According to scientists, the patch has been growing “exponentially” in recent years. The March estimate found it was 16 times larger than previously expected. Lecomte and his support team intend to sample the water they swim through every day of the journey, and gauge the level of plastic and microplastic pollution. The expedition’s first mate, Tyral Dalitz, told the ABC the team wanted to dispel a myth about the garbage patch. Rather than being made up of large pieces of plastic, most of the pollution is made up of invisible pieces of microplastic that sit in the water like a “plastic smog”, he said. “In reality the truth is much worse – the ocean is now filled with microplastics ... Rather than calling it an island of trash, it is more like plastic smog throughout the ocean.”The team will also be catching fish along the journey to track how plastic pollution accumulates within the food chain. To complete the journey Lecomte plans to swim for eight hours, or 50km, each day. He will use ocean currents to push him along and will wear a shark repellant bracelet. He told the ABC that the psychological factor was the hardest part. “It’s mind over matter … Sometimes that’s very difficult to do, when you are dry and sleepy and in pain, to jump in the water and to stay in that water for eight hours when it’s cold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceff7e56463a0fb27da6a6b2e75ae32d62b72f1e/154_293_3139_1883/master/3139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd33673569bfbdc962bb3c5e00f67e89","title":"concussion loris karius liverpool goalkeeper champions league final massachusetts","story":"• Massachusetts General ‘carefully reviewed the game film’• Liverpool fined €29,000 for three instances of crowd disorderLoris Karius’s calamitous performance in the Champions League final could have been a result of concussion he sustained against Real Madrid, a doctor who assessed the Liverpool goalkeeper in Boston has said.Liverpool sent Karius for a head scan at Massachusetts General Hospital last Thursday amid concern at his reaction to a collision with Real’s captain, Sergio Ramos. The 24‑year‑old made two major errors that contributed to Real’s 3-1 victory. The first presented Karim Benzema with the opening goal and came soon after he received a blow to the head from Ramos as they challenged at the near post. Later Karius allowed Gareth Bale to put the contest beyond Liverpool with a long-range shot that squirmed through his hands.The German flew to the US on holiday after the final but Liverpool’s medical department was sufficiently concerned about the impact of Ramos’s challenge that it arranged a scan in Boston. Karius had a consultation with Dr Ross Zafonte, an authority on head-trauma injuries suffered by NFL players and the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Massachusetts General.A statement released on Monday by the hospital on Dr Zafonte’s behalf and with the player’s permission confirmed that Karius had been concussed.It read: “On May 31, 2018 Mr Karius underwent a comprehensive examination by Dr Ross Zafonte and Dr Lenore Herget in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history – including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms – physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr Karius sustained a concussion during the match 26\u0026nbspMay 2018.“At the time of our evaluation Mr Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event. Additional symptomatic and objectively noted areas of dysfunction also persisted. It could be possible that such deficits would affect performance.“We also note that Mr Karius has reported significant and steady improvement since the concussive event, and we expect him to make a full recovery based on the results of the examination. We expect that with treatment and by following prescribed activity protocols he will continue to improve. We have encouraged vigilance and an emphasis on safety in his eventual return to full activity.”Karius has continued his holiday in California following the assessment in Boston and is due to return to pre-season training with Liverpool on 2 July.The Anfield club have been fined €20,000 (£17,567) for disturbances at the Champions League quarter-final first leg in April, which included an attack on the Manchester City bus, Uefa announced on Monday.

The Pergau Dam affair, in which hundreds of millions of pounds in UK aid were linked to a major arms deal, was uncovered by a National Audit Office report in 1993.Projects supported by the prosperity fund – which is administered by the Foreign Office and paid out £46m in 2017 – included development of the Chinese film industry, improving the Chinese museum infrastructure and improving the credit bond rating system in China, MPs found.“It is unclear to us how these types of interventions will benefit the world’s poorest people both those living in the countryside and the urban poor,” they said.The report, which also raised concerns over transparency of aid spending outside the Department for International Development, called for the department, given its expertise, to sign off all overseas aid.Last month, the committee urged Penny Mordaunt to “get a real grip” on aid spending by departments other than DfID, after it emerged aid money spent via the prosperity fund had “very tenuous links” to poverty reduction. Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the One campaign, welcomed the IDC’s findings.“The IDC is right to call out aid that doesn’t meet its core purpose of fighting poverty,” she said. “Their recommendation that DfID – with its world-leading expertise in using aid effectively – be given final sign-off of UK aid spent anywhere in Whitehall is spot on.”Greenhill also welcomed the IDC’s recommendation that the government should make systematic improvements to coherence, transparency and the poverty focus of cross-government funds before increasing their share of overseas aid cash.The prosperity fund and the conflict, security and stability fund (CSSF), both cross-government aid pots, spent a total of £603m overseas aid in 2016-17.The report said that cross-government projects should focus on the world’s poor. It said: “The increasingly prominent role played by the cross-government funds raises particular concern given their shortcomings in focus upon poverty reduction and transparency. We found, in practice, many prosperity fund projects showed very weak targeting at their primary objective, with negligible targeting towards helping the poorest and most vulnerable.”MPs said this raised “concerns about the potential to lead to tied aid, with the recipient of aid dependent upon granting the UK trade partnerships”.Stephen Twigg, the IDC chair, said “serious questions” needed to be asked of the prosperity fund.“There’s a serious risk that we could go backwards,” he said. “We’ve seen this drive to increasing the amount of spend in departments other than DfID. We have had an effective doubling of the proportion of ODA spent in departments other than DfiD.MPs also expressed concern over the transparency of the CSSF. They received “contradictory reports” in evidence of the CSSF’s approach to redacting information, with suggestions that information was routinely redacted.“This lack of clarity risks undermining faith in the UK aid brand,” the report said.The committee said overseas development assistance should not be used as a “slush fund” to pay for the UK’s diplomatic, trade or national security interests, but should be used to reduce poverty, to help the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.The MPs called for a review of all existing programmes under the prosperity fund and said that the CSSF should also be reviewed in its current form. They also called for the aid watchdog, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, to scrutinise cross-government funds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcc7aa341129d47820a5787f250c05917b4c6c54/0_235_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=419cd164e41e13e55378935f34148b01","title":"ruby tandoh recipe sweet cherry marzipan buns","story":"Sit back while the dough rises, then enjoy a fruity treatMaking bread at home can take a while, but if you’ve got a lazy afternoon at your disposal, it’s well worth the trouble: most of the time it takes to nurse these breads from heavy little dough lumps to magnificent, sticky buns is spent just waiting for the yeast to do its work, during which time you can catch up on Love Island, if you’re lucky.

The delay of the document, which was intended to put the UK on the front foot in negotiations but is said to still be “riddled with red ink”, underlines the deep ides that continue to exist in cabinet over customs plans and the Irish border. May’s spokesman was unable to say whether the white paper, expected to include detail on areas including financial services, security and dispute settlement, would be ready by the Brussels summit. “I’ve not put a timeframe on it, other than we will bring it forward as soon as possible,” he said.No 10 said the June summit was simply a “staging post” towards Brexit while other government sources suggested that the EU would primarily be seeking progress on the so-called backstop option.Edwin Morgan, head of media relations at the Institute of Directors, which was represented at the talks, added: “Businesses need clarity about the government’s objectives to help them to plan. Everything is still subject to negotiation with the EU, but we don’t yet know what the UK will pushing for in key areas like customs. “Our members want to know whether the government’s forthcoming white paper will make clear their intentions on VAT, customs and regulatory alignment – to understand in what areas ministers foresee continued harmonisation with EU rules, and where they want freedom to erge.”It has been reported that the UK may seek to stay inside the EU’s VAT area after Brexit, which would require the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, one of May’s red lines.The business leaders were also said to have warned the prime minister that maintaining frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit was probably more important than the imposition of any tariffs.After the meeting, a No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister provided an update on the negotiations … setting out plans to provide greater detail of the future relationship in a white paper due to be published shortly. “The business representatives expressed their support for this approach, which will build on information provided through the prime minister’s various speeches.“Brexit secretary David Davis, chancellor Philip Hammond, business secretary Greg Clark and trade secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting.

We do it because we believe our perspective matters and it may be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a  supporter. Thank you.Three weeks from the EU summit at which the EU 27 expects the UK to table answers to the two key Brexit questions: what kind of customs relationship it wants and how it plans to solve the Irish border problem. Nothing suggests the government will be able to do so.The Brexit secretary, David Davis, sort of had a bash, reportedly mooting an entirely unworkable post-Brexit customs fudge whereby Northern Ireland would have both EU and UK status plus a 10-mile “buffer zone” between it and the Republic to avoid border checks, but No 10 was quick to knock it down.Officially, the cabinet is still “refining” two potential customs solutions: the so-called customs partnership, under which the UK would collect import duties on behalf of the EU, and its more technology-focused “max-fac” alternative – both of which the EU has already rejected as unworkable. A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Sadly, Brussels is also deeply suspicious of Theresa May’s “backstop” plan to leave the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU until the Irish border issue is solved. So conversations over dinner in Brussels on 28 June are set to be lively, and unproductive. Increasingly, it looks like crunch time will be October’s EU summit.Meanwhile, top European industrialists warned the prime minister that time was fast running out if she wanted to ensure post-Brexit trade was as frictionless as in a customs union. The influential Open Europe thinktank said the UK should accept continued EU regulations in goods in return for single market access:Further raising the pressure on the beleaguered May, ex-cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Damian Green told her she must ignore extremist minorities on Brexit and listen instead to moderate voices in her party arguing for a “pragmatic approach” and “sensible” deal.Still, if you believe the government and Brexiters (and why wouldn’t you?) at least we won’t risk Armageddon if we leave without a deal. A leaked Whitehall report predicting the port of Dover would collapse and food, fuel and medicine run out within days was dismissed as “false”, “hysterical” and “fear on speed”.Faced with that leaked Whitehall report on the cataclysmic consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the  says it is high time for realism - on both sides:The costs of Brexit will largely be borne by the British but some will fall on the EU27 as well. It is in no one’s interests to have Britain decline into a sullen and impoverished island locked for decades into a bitter and interminable argument with itself over who was to blame for its condition, like a orced man drinking alone in a bedsit. Who would want that for a neighbour? The first requirement is realism, on both sides. Britain’s stances towards Brexit at the moment are based on self-delusion. But at the same time, the EU cannot expect that a future British government will see the error of its ways and come back begging for forgiveness and a fresh start. The worse the consequences of Brexit become, the more the leavers will blame them on unreasonable foreigners. Nor will this kind of nationalist rage against Brussels be confined to the UK.In the Independent, Andrew Grice argues that Donald Trump’s tariff war has strengthened the case for a customs union with the EU: The Brexiteers will argue that it would be easier for the UK to reach agreement with the US than to wait for a EU-US deal with 28 varying EU interests to accommodate. Eurosceptics insist that allowing the EU to continue to negotiate the UK’s trade agreements after Brexit would be even worse than EU membership, since we would have no influence over them. But Brussels has promised Britain consultation on future trade deals the EU would negotiate on the UK’s behalf if it stayed in a customs union. That looks increasingly like the right course. The Foreign Office’s mantra is to “hug the US close”. Trump’s actions prove that it’s time to rewrite it, and accept that to “hug the EU close” after Brexit is now in the national interest.Germany’s Brexit czar is not optimistic for the June summit, and reckons October is going to be an almighty scramble:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd583af559a32f99f31e0100e988f6018e895d39/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9669ed7f27d5a5d6fc92b76a1cdbc021","title":"jeremy corbyn calls for investigation alleged islamophobia conservative party","story":"Labour leader, Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi and the Muslim Council of Britain press resistant home secretaryJeremy Corbyn has called for an inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party.The Tories have been under pressure since the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an investigation, highlighting a range of claims including candidates and other representatives allegedly having far-right connections or sending offensive tweets.The Labour leader backed calls for an investigation on Monday night after home secretary Sajid Javid rejected the proposition of an inquiry, which gained support from Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi.The new home secretary is the first BAME holder of one of the great offices of state, a former investment banker and Margaret Thatcher devotee who is on the right of the Conservative party. His appointment will keep the balance of EU leavers and remainers in the top offices, but only just. Javid backed remain, but with some hesitation.Born in Rochdale in 1969, he is – like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan – a Muslim son of a bus driver who has risen to the top of British politics. His parents were born in India, but fled to Pakistan. His father arrived in Britain in the 1960s – Javid has said he came with £1 in his pocket.After leaving banking for politics in 2010, the MP for Bromsgrove rose quickly, beginning as parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne before continuing as a protege of the former chancellor in junior roles at the Treasury.He got his first cabinet job in just his fourth year in parliament when he was appointed culture secretary in 2014, and was appointed business secretary after the 2015 election.After an abortive attempt with his friend\u0026nbspStephen Crabb to mount a bid for the leadership, where he would have been chancellor, he took the communities brief under Theresa May. His biggest challenge has been the Grenfell Tower disaster, where the government has faced criticism for stalling on promises to the victims’ families.“I think if there are allegations made then an inquiry should be held and it should be addressed and it should be dealt with,” Corbyn told the Press Association at a west London mosque.“Islamophobia, as with antisemitism, as with any other form of racism, has no place whatsoever in our society or in any of our political parties. Nobody should be condoning it, nobody should be hiding it, everybody should be exposing it.”He highlighted reported rises of Islamophobic hate crimes, and added: “Let’s dedicate ourselves, during Ramadan, to say we will drive out Islamophobia from our society.”Corbyn was speaking at al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in Westbourne Park after an evening meal for Muslims to end their daily Ramadan fast.The opposition leader has himself come under pressure over allegations of antisemitism in his own party, leading Theresa May, the prime minister, to accuse him of allowing it to “run rife”.The MCB general secretary Harun Rashid Khan last week wrote to the Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis, saying there had been “more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia” by Tory figures in April.Khan also highlighted Zac Goldsmith’s unsuccessful bid against Labour’s Sadiq Khan to become mayor of London in 2016, claiming there had been no action against those responsible for “shocking Islamophobia” during the campaign.Rejecting the calls for an inquiry, Javid told the Andrew Marr Show the MCB did not represents Muslims in the UK.He added: “I would be very suspicious of anything that they’ve got to say, not least because under the last Labour government and a policy continued by us, we don’t deal with the MCB and we don’t deal with it because too many of their members have had, you know, comments on extremists and that’s not acceptable.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7057e725e6f1eeb03d9a35711f3be8824f9e3dea/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b65801018d449ad1068b3ec13658ce0","title":"charlie appleby aidan obrien masar derby godolphin","story":"• Trainer says Godolphin now have ‘a horse they’ve got to beat’• Appleby admits Godolphin had been failing to punch its weightA kind of admission came from Godolphin’s Derby-winning trainer, Charlie Appleby, as he reflected with relish on Masar’s win at Epsom on Saturday. Surrounded by dozens of gleeful staffers here at his Newmarket stable, where a good part of Monday was taken up by celebratory photographs with the horse, Appleby conceded that Godolphin had for years been failing to punch its weight in high-profile clashes with Aidan O’Brien’s runners.“People in racing want to see competition,” Appleby said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been competitive enough. That’s the honesty of it. I can flower it up as much as I want but we haven’t been competitive. We know that.“We’re not in a bubble. I know what people are saying outside these gates. But that just gives us more determination and drive to prove people wrong. We’re going into the rest of the season with a horse that they’ve got to beat.” He expects to choose between the Eclipse and the Irish Derby for Masar’s next target.Appleby’s wife, Aisling, used to transport Ballydoyle-based horses to race in France and further afield and the trainer now takes the view that that willingness to send horses abroad has been part of the reason for O’Brien’s success. “They travel their horses all round the world and they just seem to get stronger. I think mentally they strengthen. And if you’re mentally strong, the rest of your body is strong. If you see people who panic, they’re generally pretty lightweight. Those who don’t stress as much put condition on.”Masar raced in the US last autumn, a venture to the Breeders’ Cup which was thoroughly disappointing at the time, as he could finish only sixth. But Appleby now feels it may have been the making of the colt.“It’s definitely helped him there’s no doubt about it,” he said, adding that the horse has developed an even temperament that proved invaluable in the Epsom hubbub. Pointing to where Masar was relaxed amid the taking of a thousand selfies, Appleby added: “Not too many horses would stand there with 100 people around them. He’s got a great head on him.”Appleby’s five-year training career could now be interpreted as one of steady progress towards Saturday’s summit and he was happy to point to his excellent strike-rate in the Derby, having only ever had three runners in the race. That sparing approach did not feel so good two years ago, when he did not have a runner and opted to stay at Moulton Paddocks when all of Godolphin’s other senior figures were climbing into helicopters to go and watch the big race at Epsom.Tips by Greg Wood.“But I’ll never forget the boss, Sheikh Mohammed, put his arm round me and said: ‘Don’t worry, Charlie, there’s a Derby next year for you.’ That’s the person he is.”“I think this is a great confidence-boost for Charlie,” said Godolphin’s managing director, Hugh Anderson. “We’ve all known that he has got the potential. He’s desperate to be successful.“This is an absolute credit to him and he did come in in difficult circumstances,” Anderson added, alluding to the doping scandal that disgraced Mahmood al-Zarooni, Godolphin’s trainer at Moulton Paddocks until 2013. “It seems a long time ago now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fed0a4edf9a393368b0e92c763d31344b95c64e/171_114_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc497995395dd578d4a22ecfc15dc6d2","title":"england six nations stuart lancaster south africa defence key","story":"• South Africa’s defence is key, adds former England coach• Additon of overseas-based Boks will aid home cause, he addsEddie Jones’s predecessor as national head coach, Stuart Lancaster, has warned the England players and management to brace themselves for a challenging tour of South Africa and expects them to be under intense pressure from the moment the three‑Test series kicks off in Johannesburg on Saturday.Lancaster was in charge of the previous England touring side to South Africa in 2012, when the Springboks won the opening two Tests before drawing the third. Six years later he believes the home team are on the rise and will grow stronger under the command of the former Munster head coach Rassie Erasmus.“I think it’s a tough tour this year,” said Lancaster, one of the key architects of Leinster’s historic European and Pro14 double success last season.“Rassie Erasmus, who I’ve coached against at Munster, will do a great job in galvanising the South Africans. And the person people haven’t talked about much is Jacques Nienaber, who was the defence coach at Munster. He’s a very good defence coach. If you get those South Africans organised defensively, irrespective of their attack, then it’s a tough series.”Lancaster said he can still “vividly” remember the first quarter of England’s previous visit to Ellis Park six years ago, when the Springboks made such a storming start to the second Test that they were 22-3 ahead with an hour of the game still left. “After about 20 minutes this wave of green shirts was crashing over us,” Lancaster recalled. “You’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, this could be 40 or 50.’South Africa’s rugby fortunes have subsequently declined with numerous top players opting to sign with overseas clubs, but Erasmus has included Wasps’ Willie le Roux, Sale’s Faf de Klerk, Duane Vermuelen of Toulon and the Montpellier duo Frans Steyn and Bismarck du Plessis in his squad for the England games.Lancaster still thinks that Jones’s side have the potential to win the series – “I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins in the end” – but suspects the home side will be sharply improved.“I watched South Africa play here in November and Ireland beat them 38-3. What has changed is that Rassie will bring back some players from overseas. If you put the best SA team together it’s a formidable team, and then you layer on their sense of pride in the shirt.”Jamie George, meanwhile, has admitted Dylan Hartley will be missed in the South Africa series as he prepares for a first extended run in the No\u0026nbsp2 jersey. George has started in only two of his 25 England appearances but is in line for another three against the Springboks with Hartley, whose first game as the national captain was that 2012 draw in Port Elizabeth, missing out on the tour due to concussion.“I have to try and drive the standards within the team because Dylan was brilliant at that and we are definitely missing that side of things,” George said. “Filling those shoes will be difficult, but also something I relish. But I also want to make sure I put my own spin on it.”George also expects his close friend and Saracens team-mate Owen Farrell to flourish as Hartley’s replacement as captain. “What I have learnt with him is that the more responsibility he gets, the better he gets as a player and as a leader,” he said. “He relishes the challenge and he is a brilliant captain. At 19-20 he was hot-headed but he has learnt that isn’t the way all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d2a3849521e978dc3793f7655cfe5512b70ce33/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670f2bf618ec435b413e9dcb8b0fa63f","title":"tuesdays best tv our girl ackley bridge","story":"In the second of these four-episode blocks (the final episodes of season three are expected later this year), Corporal Georgie Lane (Michelle Keegan) and the rest of 2 Section have been deployed to Nigeria, where they are tasked with rescuing a group of schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists – a storyline clearly inspired by the real-life abduction in 2014.

They allege it happened shortly after a grand jury returned a new indictment against him, violating the terms of his house arrest. Mueller has indicted Manafort in federal courts in Washington and Virginia. He was released to home confinement after his arraignment in October. Manafort faces felony charges in the two cases over allegations he concealed tens of millions of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service that he had earned advising pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine. He is also accused of conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government. The events took place before Trump ran for president.Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.FBI agent Brock Domin wrote in court documents that Manafort “contacted and attempted to contact” two unnamed witnesses, “in an effort to influence their testimony and to otherwise conceal evidence”. He added: “The investigation into this matter is ongoing.” The witnesses, according to the court filings, worked with Manafort in organizing the Hapsburg Group, described by the counsel’s office as “a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine, including by lobbying in the United States”.One of the potential witnesses told the government that he believed Manafort’s outreach was an effort to “suborn perjury”, a criminal offense to induce a witness to lie under oath. Manafort attempted to contact one of the witnesses in February after a federal grand jury in Washington returned a “superseding indictment”, which accused him of having “secretly retained” a group of European officials to lobby for positions favorable to Ukraine in the US. According to the court filing, Manafort called and messaged one of the witnesses on 24 February, the day after his longtime associate and a former Trump campaign official entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. During one call the witness told the government that Manafort identified himself and said he wanted to give “a heads-up about Hapsburg”. The witness said he hung up because he was “concerned” about the call, according to the affidavit. Manafort continued to try to contact him with an encrypted messaging application. Through the app, Manafort sent a link to Business Insider story titled “Former European leaders struggle to explain themselves after Mueller claims Paul Manafort paid them to lobby for Ukraine”. Then he wrote: “We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.”The filing says: “The government confirmed that these messages were sent by Manafort, upon review of Manafort’s iCloud account pursuant to a court-authorized search.”Trump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russia and on Monday called Mueller’s investigation a “phony Russian witch hunt”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9819d15f61398446aeae4fed7efa528942c1c07/0_86_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247ce5a4f9e076511ca193a7faa369fa","title":"the world as it is review ben rhodes obama legacy","story":"The former White House aide has written a memoir and a justification which is compelling but too much on Obama’s sideBen Rhodes is the Barack Obama speechwriter and national security staffer who helped drive the Iran deal and negotiated the thaw between the US and Cuba. Over time, he earned his fair share of enemies. Indeed, he has the tire marks on his back to prove it.Last month, days before Donald Trump’s decision to junk the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Observer and Ronan Farrow reported on the efforts of Black Cube, an Israeli intelligence-gathering firm, to discredit Rhodes and other Obama administration officials – just as Black Cube abetted Harvey Weinstein in his attempt to silence his victims. Five years ago, voices from the Pentagon derided Rhodes and others as jihadis in the White House after they opposed continued aid to Egypt in the aftermath of the military takeover. In The World As It Is, Rhodes tells his side of the story. As to be expected, he gives a full-throated defense of the JCPOA and seeks to extricate himself from the Benghazi debacle. What makes the book truly illuminating, however, are its quotes, barbs and reflexive disdain for flyover country. Right off the bat, Rhodes hones in on the Clintons’ mistaken belief that the 2008 Democratic nomination was theirs as a matter of right. He writes of how the late Richard Holbrooke, a former United Nations ambassador and Clinton confidante, reportedly kept “a list of everyone” who went to work for Obama, in the mistaken belief Hillary Clinton would have the opportunity to settle scores and Holbrooke would be named secretary of state.As for former vice-president Joe Biden, the one Democrat who could have defeated Trump, Rhodes tags him as an “unguided missile”, prone to press the flesh of those he met while walking the West Wing’s hallways. Imagine, someone who is human. And likeable.Oppositional foreign leaders likewise get zinged. Boris Johnson caught Rhodes’ wrath after hypothesizing that Obama swapped out an Oval Office bust of Winston Churchill for Martin Luther King on account of the “part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British Empire – of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender”. Obama labels the foreign secretary as Britain’s Trump. “With better hair,” Rhodes adds. Rhodes quotes Obama complaining that negotiating with Benjamin Netanyahu was like dealing with the Republicans. Rhodes tweaks Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s former president, as “spotlight loving” for initiating discussions of a no-fly zone in Libya. The book also takes a swing at Vladimir Putin, and the affinity in some conservative circles for the Russian strongman. Think Alabama’s Roy Moore, California’s Dana Rohrabacher and Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan. Obama rightly opines that “some of these folks … have more in common with Putin than with me”. Rhodes labels Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, “unpatriotic” for refusing to unequivocally condemn Russian electoral interference in 2016.Rhodes does his best to sell the Iran deal while hoping to give the administration cover. To blunt criticisms that the JCPOA represented a sudden policy reversal, he offers a chronology of sorts.He recounts how even during Obama’s battle for the Democratic nomination, the then senator expressed a willingness to meet with Iran and Cuba, without preconditions. Rhodes then ascribes the June 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran’s president as a catalyst for negotiations later that year in Oman. In Rhodes’ telling, the Iran deal is an organic culmination of Obama’s promises.Understandably, Obama and Rhodes are alarmed by Brexit, Trump and the erosion of the existing order. Rhodes recounts how Obama was disturbed by a New York Times column which posited that tribalism undergirds our politics and that the Democrats’ message sounded awfully like John Lennon’s Imagine, a pastiche of gauzy cosmopolitan bromides. Obama remarked: “Maybe we pushed too far … Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.” Left unsaid by Rhodes was that the Obamans’ upstairs-downstairs coalition was tribal in its own way, an alliance that grew further orced from Middle America as time passed.Rhodes stands on firmer ground when he examines the contradictions within American foreign policy, or, as he puts it, how “reality contributes to occasional schizophrenia”. As one example, Rhodes observes how the anti-communist Afghan freedom fighters of the 1980s morphed into 21st-century jihadists. To Rhodes’ credit, he also acknowledges that Obama’s “reset” with Russia did not work. Looming on the horizon is the 2021 expiration date of the Start Treaty, which limits each country’s nuclear arsenal. Right now, no talks are ongoing. A renewed arms race may be imminent.Like a doctor taught to do no harm, Rhodes repeats Obama’s aphorism, “don’t do stupid shit”. That is easier said than done. Obama may have won a Nobel peace prize for simply succeeding George W Bush, but he left his infamous “red line” promise in Syria in tatters and the once vaunted Arab spring as a bloody memory. Trump believes he too is entitled to a prize for merely marketing as a success his summit with North Korea while doing his best to undo Obama’s legacy.

Instead, Brazilians argue over when and how state-controlled oil company Petrobras should set fuel prices – the cause of the strike – and whether it should make money for its shareholders or swallow losses for the benefit of the nation.Brazilians can’t even agree on what the dictatorship was. Many “interventionists” mistakenly believe there was no corruption under the military.And others point out that hundreds of regime opponents were executed and thousands more viciously tortured under the repressive regime that ran the country for two decades until 1985.The cash-strapped conservative government of Michel Temer found the money by cutting investment elsewhere, including for health and education – a move likely to increase social tension in a country where poverty is on the rise.“We have watched a flirtation with collective suicide,” wrote rightwing commentator Reinaldo Azevedo, who compared Brazilians heading to the polls in October’s congressional and presidential elections to lemmings heading for a clifftop.Leftist commentators are equally alarmed. “It is a dangerous moment,” said Laura Carvalho, a professor of economy at the University of São Paulo. “This is related to the economic crisis, the political crisis, the corruption scandals.”The 2016 impeachment of Workers’ party president Dilma Rousseff – who was removed for breaking budget rules amid widespread anger over an enormous corruption scheme – was seen by some as a justified action against a corrupt government.And since then, Temer and his ministers have been embroiled in even more spectacular scandals.“This foments this idea that a military regime could in a way alter, transform this system,” Carvalho said. “It is a response of total disbelief.”The only politician likely to benefit from all of this is Jair Bolsonaro, an extreme rightwing lawmaker who has praised the military regime but has not faced serious graft allegations – and who flip-flopped on his support for the strike.That Petrobras is central to Brazil’s latest nightmare is no surprise.The corruption scandal that eventually felled Rousseff began with allegations that her political allies had received kickbacks from inflated contracts the company signed with contractors.The allegations quickly spread to engulf the country’s political class, but also hit Petrobras, which was unable to complete two new refineries that would have allowed Brazil to produce more gasoline and diesel.Rousseff’s administration forced Petrobras to sell gasoline and diesel below international prices to keep inflation down, costing it billions of dollars in revenue. Under Temer, the company swung in the opposite direction and started raising prices daily as the international cost of oil soared.On Friday, the company’s CEO, Pedro Parente, resigned, in a move that was celebrated by labour unions but lamented by financial markets. Petrobras shares tanked.Industry experts said the company should have showed more “sensitivity” in its price rises.But sensitivity has been drowned out in an atmosphere of increasing polarisation.Left and right hurl insults at each other over social media like rival supporters at a soccer game. Meanwhile, economists are slashing their growth forecasts for an economy only just limping out of recession.“The strike and calls for military intervention are a wake-up call,” said Ilona Szabó, co-founder of Agora! (Now!), a new centrist group propagating “evidence-based public policies”. Szabo argued that too many people are looking for simplistic solutions to complex problems.“Brazilians are crying for change but it’s not yet clear that they are prepared to put the public interest in front of private gain. Instead of rolling up their sleeves and building a common project they are clamouring for a saviour, a strongman, who can deliver the country from ruin,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4147b423f4cf218147add1fc0bae90b233b048/0_310_4747_2849/master/4747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84153217d4d910dce2a55ef3c0dcfc07","title":"china denies visas to australian journalists due to frosty diplomatic relations","story":"Group had been due to leave on Thursday with Bob Carr’s Australia-China thinktankA group of Australian journalists has been blocked from travelling to China because of “frosty” diplomatic relations between the two countries.The reporters have been denied visas to travel this week. Between five and eight journalists, including the veteran political reporter Paul Bongiorno, had been due to leave for China on Thursday with Bob Carr’s Australia China Relations Institute.Each year the institute takes a delegation of journalists on a China trip. Carr told ABC radio on Tuesday that after speaking to China’s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, last week he had discovered that the visas were being blocked because of “frosty” diplomatic relations between the two countries.He told the ABC that the refusal was “more than a bureaucratic challenge”.“I spoke to the ambassador and asked him to look at the delay we were having with his officials in Canberra,” Carr said. Australia’s diplomatic relationship with China has come under considerable strain in the past 18 months as Australia’s focus on Beijing’s influence in domestic affairs has increased. Carr blamed “loose” diplomatic language from the Turnbull government for the freeze in relations. In March last year the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, gave a speech in Singapore in which she warned China that “democracy and democratic institutions are essential for nations if they are to reach their economic potential”. Then in December the Turnbull government introduced its foreign interference and espionage bills to parliament, both of which were explicitly tied to fears of Chinese influence. Carr said those events had helped lead to a situation where relations were in a more “serious state of deterioration” than they had been in previously. He said Australia’s national interest was being “trashed” by ideological opposition to China.“We’ve drifted with a different rhetoric on China since early 2017, well in advance of the anti-espionage, anti-influence legislation which was announced in December 2017,” Carr said.“Currently we’re the American ally with the most adversarial rhetorical position towards China.” He said the refusal was evidence of “frostiness” in the relationship. “It confirms other evidence, reports that the trade minister was not able to get a meting with senior Chinese trade officials,” he said.Bongiorno told the ABC that the group had been due to fly out on Thursday and that the trip had already been planned. “We’re getting the message loud and clear that Beijing and China aren’t all that happy with Australia and relations are pretty cool if not frigid at the moment,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec41bf91fc96f64bf4c111a65cd99bad4bced0c0/0_167_3512_2107/master/3512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25128490747c871f8fbad56ec829fc46","title":"netanyahu on european mission to dismantle iran nuclear pact","story":"Israeli prime minister fails to persuade Angela Merkel to give up backing for Iran nuclear dealIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has failed to prise Angela Merkel away from supporting the Iran nuclear deal as he embarked on a three-country tour of Europe aimed at burying the agreement.Hosting her Israeli counterpart in Berlin, Merkel said Germany supported Israel’s right to security, but resisted Netanyahu’s insistence that tearing up the non-proliferation deal was the best way to achieve this.“We support Israel’s right to security and have said this to Iran at all times,” she said. “We have the same goal that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon and the difference between us is how to do that.”Netanyahu was hoping to get Germany, France and Britain to soften support for the joint comprehensive plan of action, from 2015, under which Iran agreed to dramatically reduce its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.Donald Trump announced last month that Washington was withdrawing from the agreement, but the Europeans expressed regret at his move and stressed their continued commitment to the pact.Iran has also continued to abide by the agreement. However, several top officials have suggested it may resume its enrichment activities unless the European Union presents a compensation package to make up for income loss resulting from the fresh US sanctions.Trump and Netanyahu have criticised the deal’s perceived shortcomings, warning about “sunset” provisions that end restrictions on nuclear activities after 10 years, as well as permitting the continued development of long-range missiles.In a televised presentation days before Trump was due to make a decision, Netanyahu revealed what he said was new evidence of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The material shown did not present a breach of the deal but European leaders suggested it showed evidence of Iran’s nuclear programme before 2015, which, they said, only reinforced the need for the agreement, which includes regular inspections.Netanyahu said he would share the documents, which he said had come from a warehouse in Tehran, with the US and other countries and is expected to discuss the findings during his trip.The Netanyahu visit came as the director general of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said his inspectors had access to all the sites his team needed to visit in Iran.Speaking at the first meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors since Trump threw the future of the deal in doubt, rebutted suggestions that Iran was not cooperating.Netanyahu’s European visit is in some ways targeted at the credibility of the IAEA. The majority of the board’s members are likely to issue statements through the week challenging the US decision to withdraw, and the repeated Israeli intelligence claim that Iran is secretly preparing a nuclear bomb.Amano urged Tehran to go further in showing its willingness to offer reassurance, saying “timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access would facilitate implementation … and enhance confidence”.In its last report, the IAEA confirmed Iran was still implementing the accord.Netanyahu will also use his European tour to warn against Iran’s military entrenchment in Syria, where Tehran has sent forces to support President Bashar al-Assad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

Photograph: North West NewspixThis year, students from Carndonagh Community School in Donegal will share their experience of the Leaving Cert in The  each day, as well as their hopes, dreams and fears for the future.The road to Ireland’s most northerly school passes through the city of Derry before winding through the stunning Inishowen peninsula along the disputed territory of Lough Foyle.“Inishowen is one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland but has suffered due to its remoteness from Dublin and its proximity to the Border and the Troubles,” says Paul Fiorentini, principal of Carndonagh Community School. “It is a major source of frustration to us that every year we send off another crop of talented pupils who are unlikely to ever come back.“We need Government support to open up the northwest. The loss of the plane link from Derry to Dublin in the recession was a major blow. We need the A5 as a matter of urgency.”Emigration is the lot of most young people from Carndonagh. Last month, the county as a whole narrowly voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The No vote in Donegal reflects the reality that significant numbers of young people from Donegal voted Yes in Dublin, Galway or Sligo, because they have been forced to leave their home county for work.Only the economic nexus of Letterkenny-Derry provides any real local chances. However, Derry suffered during the recession and some of its citizens are growing increasingly frustrated at what they see as a focus on Belfast at the expense of the Maiden City (on the other hand, house prices there are significantly cheaper than in Dublin or Belfast).Carndonagh CS – known locally (in a Donegal accent) as “The Cairn” – was founded in 1973 following the amalgamation of three local schools and is a multi-denominational and co-educational school with a Christian ethos.At its height, it had more than 1,600 pupils and was the largest school in Ireland. Numbers have fallen from 1,530 in 2000 to 1,027 today – plus about 80 teachers – but it remains one of the largest schools in the State.While Carndonagh itself is a tight-knit community of just under 2,500 people, young people are bussed in to the school from across the wider Inis peninsula. The local nightclub, Tul Na Rí, is a popular spot for young people right across Inishowen.“Distance permeates our lives,” says Fiorentini. “If we get sick, it is a 40-mile trip to Letterkenny, or if we are sicker, off to Galway or Dublin. If we are to engage beyond the school gates, then travel is a major consideration.”The school is perhaps the remotest in Ireland: the nearest railway station in the Republic is over two hours away, in Sligo.Just across the Border is a rail link connecting Derry to Dublin via Belfast. The road journey to Dublin can, at peak times, take five hours. Many of the pupils here come from small farming backgrounds, there is little if any industrial employment left in the area and the fishing industry is in decline.Brexit represents a serious threat to the already precarious future of the peninsula.“It could be catastrophic for us. I remember what a hard border was like and the complications it introduced. It could be a real stimulus to extremists. We have several staff living in Derry, and to leave Donegal we have to go through Northern Ireland.”Despite challenges outside its control, the school is a hive of activity, recently winning the Irish schools senior soccer championship.Graduates are found throughout Irish third-levels, especially Letterkenny IT and Northwest College in Derry. The school is enthusiastically embracing the new junior cycle curriculum which emphasises a more dynamic relationship with learning, says the principal.Only one of our diarists, Callum Doherty, sees a long-term future for himself in Carndonagh, and he hopes that the roll-out of broadband nationwide will provide him with the chance to build a life and career for himself in his home town.But, as evidenced by talking to our diarists, Donegal’s young people look out beyond their county boundary, to the rest of the island and over to Europe. “Our future is connected with Europe and we are European in outlook,” says Fiorentini.“We welcome children from all over the world and we participate in the BeLongTo LGBT Stand up week. We may live on a peninsula, but we refuse to be insular.”Tara (18) hopes to study physiotherapy at UCD, with sport science as a possible back-up option.Her favourite subjects are English and biology, and her least favourite are maths and history. Her top study tip is to read notes out loud and to use flashcards.Tara’s biggest worry is not getting the points she needs and having to repeat the exams, and she is most excited by the possibilities of being young. She is not particularly worried about Brexit but is concerned that her ability to travel may be curtailed by border checks.Repeat student Callum (19) wants to become a journalist and is particularly interested in sports and in scriptwriting.He has applied for the bachelor of arts at NUI Galway and hopes to study history and politics before later considering a journalism masters. He has already contributed articles to local newspaper, the Inish Times.Callum’s hobbies include sport and socialising. His favourite subjects are history and English, while his least favourite are Irish, Spanish and accounting.After the Leaving Cert, he hopes to visit his brother in the US, but he worries about Trump’s policies and behaviour.He finds talking to friends useful for study. He says Brexit is “stupid” but doesn’t believe that there will ultimately be a hard border, with “all the tension it would bring”.Sarah, 18, is still undecided about what to study in college and has applied for general entry at UCD, but she may still change her mind.Her favourite subject is biology her least favourite is English. When studying, she reads, memorises and says the information out loud, and she also uses flashcards.She worries about job security and extreme weather, although she is excited about her own future independence and hopes to own a house in the future. She doesn’t really see herself returning to live in Carndonagh after college, but isn’t dead-set against it either.As for Brexit, she says the British don’t seem to know what they want, but she doesn’t think the fallout will be as bad as some fear.EJ (17) hopes to become a doctor and has applied to Trinity and the Royal College of Surgeons.He loves reading and sport and is a member of Buncrana Boxing Club. His favourite subjects are Spanish and biology, and his least favourite is Irish. When studying, he reads the information, rewrites it and breaks it into chunks where possible.He worries about finding a job but is not bothered by the likelihood of having to emigrate and, indeed, says that he is excited by the prospect of living abroad and travelling the world.He doesn’t really follow the twists and turns of Brexit but points out that thousands of people cross the Border freely every day and that Derry is a major hub for entertainment and shopping.Dylan (17) plays piano and has received a conditional acceptance to the DIT Conservatory of Music, with Maynooth University as a back-up.His favourite subjects are music and Irish and his least favourite is biology. Practice and essay-writing are among his preferred study methods. He’d like to become a music teacher and doesn’t really see himself settling long-term in Carndonagh.Dylan is excited by the prospect of independence. He thinks Brexit will be resolved and that the worst-case scenario will not play out.Jade comes from a large family and has three brothers and three sisters, and some of her older siblings have already left Donegal. The 17-year-old is studying for the Leaving Cert Applied and, after school, plans to spend a year working at the local SuperValu before going on to a higher or further education course: she is looking at childcare in Derry or Letterkenny.English and hair and beauty are her favourite subjects, and she loves rally cars and music.How does she study? “I don’t,” she says frankly. She doesn’t have any major worries or concerns and doesn’t really think about Brexit. But she hopes she can stay in Carndonagh or, at least, live close by."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519270.1528131431!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more leaving cert students than ever taking higher level subjects","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA total of just under 55,770 students are due to sit the Leaving Cert, a figure similar to last year. Photograph: Eric Luke  The The proportion of Leaving Cert students taking on higher level subjects has climbed to a new high.It is a sign that pupils are trying to make the most from recent changes to the CAO points system which reward students for what used to be E grades, or fails.In all, almost 121,000 Junior Cert and Leaving Cert students are due to begin their exams on Wednesday in 5,000 test centres across the country.Among Leaving Cert maths candidates, a record 37 per cent have registered at higher level to sit the more challenging paper, up from about 20 per cent in 2011.The increase follows the introduction of bonus points for higher level maths in recent years, along with wider changes to the CAO points system.There are also increases in the proportion of students who have applied to sit higher level exams in the Leaving Cert for many other subjects.For example, just over half of students have opted for higher level Irish for the first time, while almost three-quarters of those sitting English have opted to take on the more challenging paper.However, the numbers who end up sitting the actual exams at higher level is likely to fall slightly, given that some students opt to take an ordinary level paper on the day of the exam.Official figures compiled by the State Examinations Commission show a total of just under 55,770 are due to sit the Leaving Cert, a figure similar to last year.The numbers taking the Leaving Cert applied programme are continuing to drop, with 2,744 students due to take it this year.A longer term decline in the numbers completing this more vocational exam has been blamed by teachers on cuts in staff numbers and resources.At Junior Cert level, almost 62,000 students are due to sit the exam, a similar figure to last year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519938.1528180184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels talks mark beginning of crucial fortnight on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit.

Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments and is politically acceptable.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519429.1528143934!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald seeks coalition deal with fg or ff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald said that she expected to talk to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about forming a government.

I want us to discuss, debate, agree with others a programme for government,” Ms McDonald told The  in an interview.She said that she expected to talk to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about forming a government after the next election, although both parties have repeatedly ruled out any coalition deal with Sinn Féin.In the plainest statement yet of her party’s impatience for power in Dublin, Ms McDonald said she had no preference between the two rivals, and rejected suggestions that she had been “flirting” with Fine Gael in recent weeks. She also rejected suggestions that Sinn Féin was closer “culturally” to Fianna Fáil. She made a strong pitch to the so-called “squeezed middle”, stressing the priorities of public services and the cost of living, as she seeks to broaden Sinn Féin’s appeal from its working class base.She said that a programme for government drawn up by Sinn Féin and one of the big two parties would be a document that “will be ambitious, that will be different and that looks at the red line issues around the health system, people’s standard of living, people’s capacity to have just some disposable income at the end of the week or the end of the month”.Ms McDonald stressed the interests of “people who are at work but are still struggling, people who pay their taxes, do everything by the book and still constantly have their hand in the pocket for everything and who scratch their heads and wonder ‘what am I paying those taxes for?’“People who look at the system and say, it doesn’t work, or it doesn’t work for me, it’s not accountable.”The Sinn Féin leader is seeking to modify her party’s stance in advance of an election to try to keep it prominent in the final stages of a campaign when the attention of many voters turns to the formation of the next government.However, the Sinn Féin leader will have to convince either or both big parties to overcome their stated opposition to doing a deal with her. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has trenchantly ruled out any deal with Sinn Féin, while Fine Gael has also said it will not form an administration with the party. As recently as last weekend, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan categorically ruled out any coalition, citing the party’s economic policies and its association with the IRA, saying “a leopard doesn’t change its spots”.On Brexit, Ms McDonald backed the stated intention of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to demand substantial progress on the Irish border by the time of the June EU summit.“If we are still in a state of drift, the responsible and proportionate thing to do is to hit not the stop button, but the pause button,” she said.“We’ve said this publicly and privately to the Taoiseach.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneMary Lou McDonald is on a bit of a roll.The Sinn Féin leader was centre stage for the final phase of the abortion referendum. She’s riding high in opinion polls. The New York Times gushed last week that she was “being whispered about as the possible first female prime minister of Ireland”. And today she is serving notice that she is ready and willing to enter government.It’s McDonald’s current mission to overcome that antipathy, or manoeuvre the old rivals into a position where they feel compelled to swallow it.She can fairly point to the recent history of Irish politics, which is a procession of people doing deals they said they never would. But while the post-election numbers may mean a coalition government involving Sinn Féin is an obvious option, the example of the present Government suggests that it won’t be the only one.The process of putting together a government after the next election will be convoluted, but it’s one that McDonald is determined to elbow her way into.McDonald is luxuriating in the approval of repeal supporters since her prominent role in the abortion referendum campaign. She was especially visible in the final weeks, appearing in two television debates and performing capably in both. She describes the campaign as “actual new politics . . . because it was politics beyond politicians”.There is a bit of unfinished business for Sinn Féin, though the Government’s proposed legislation goes well beyond Sinn Féin party policy, which McDonald will now seek to change to a pro-choice position that will accord with the forthcoming abortion Bill.Debate in the party, she says, “is under way at regional level and local level”.“We had some discussion around this. How do you fairly and democratically shape party positions on this issue?”The way Sinn Féin usually does that is that the leadership decides where it wants to get to and then consults extensively with the grassroots, who then approve the position. A special ardfheis in Belfast later this month is likely to endorse the leadership position. But clearly not everyone will agree.Two Sinn Féin TDs, Peadar Tóibín and Carol Nolan, campaigned strongly for a No vote in the referendum. It looks like she will have to throw them out.“I’ve allowed lots of latitude for conscience, McDonald says, “the absolute right for people to hold their view, to articulate their view, to have their view respected . . . Where the line is drawn is where it comes to making the law and forming public policy. And in those circumstances when a Sinn Féin representative walks into an elected chamber, there is a duty on that person whoever they are to vote in accordance with Sinn Féin policy.”But they were elected by the voters, not by Sinn Féin – and they were elected on a party policy that she now proposes to change, and then to punish them when they don’t conform to the new policy.“Everyone who runs for Sinn Féin has to be a Sinn Féin member in good standing. They’re fully au fait with how the party works. All of us know how policy is arrived at . . . That’s how we do our business.”And those who in conscience cannot abide by your new position – you will show them the door?“No, I won’t. The party rules will be applied.”McDonald herself has held a pro-choice position for a long time, she says. So what about when the party’s position was not pro-choice? Did she argue and vote for anti-abortion positions then?Transcripts of Dáil debates on abortion in recent years show McDonald apparently struggling with her responsibility to hold the party line. When Clare Daly proposed a constitutional amendment in 2014, McDonald made a somewhat strangulated speech: “I am advised,” McDonald said, “that Deputy Daly’s well-intentioned proposal goes beyond the democratic mandate afforded me by virtue of my party’s long-standing compromise position, clearly stated and well-known to the electorate. I am, therefore, unable to support this legislation.”She says now: “Let me tell you, I have found myself in positions and at times prior to being leader as an activist where the party’s position didn’t accord with my personal view.”The priority of party discipline and loyalty is something frequently cited by the party’s opponents as evidence of the cultural chasm that separates it from the political mainstream.And while it might make them easy coalition partners, the party has struggled with accommodating dissent. There has been an exodus of prominent members and councillors in recent years, amid allegations of a culture of bullying and intimidation. McDonald pledged to address the issue when she became leader.“Yes, it is an issue,” she says. “I don’t believe there is a culture of bullying. But I do know that we have a changed party, a much bigger party. The way we manage the party has been suited to a smaller party. That doesn’t work now.”She says that the party is “putting the finishing touches to a commission – a commission on ersity, equality and inclusion. It will facilitate conversation across the party about the party. That will be helpful.”Is it an admission of a widespread problem?“It’s an admission that it’s a human organisation . . . It’s wrong but it happens. Rivalry between people can become a thing locally. There were incidents. That’s not unique to Sinn Féin.“You can’t say that it’ll never happen in any organisation,” McDonald says. “The members took it to heart. People took the gravest offence at the suggestion of a culture of bullying.”The question for the outside world, though, is not whether Sinn Féin members have been offended – it’s about the nature of the culture within the party, and what that says about it, and how it would use power if it came to hold it. And the party clearly has questions to answer about it.If there isn’t a culture of bullying, there is certainly a culture of obedience to authority in the party, a prioritisation of the party’s interests, and many of those who fall foul of it have been ostracised. As it prepares – it says – for government, those are questions that are unlikely to go away.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519941.1528177842!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"swimmer sets out on attempt to cross pacific ocean","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench marathon swimmer Benoit “Ben” Lecomte prepares himself in Choshi, Chiba prefecture on Tuesday at the start of his attempt of swimming across the Pacific Ocean. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhen Ben Lecomte stepped onto land for the first time after swimming across the Atlantic Ocean in 1998, he told himself ‘never again’.But, 20 years on, Lecomte is attempting an even more daunting challenge as he looks to become the first person to swim across the Pacific Ocean, covering 9,100 kilometres.On Tuesday, Lecomte and his nine-person support team set out from Tokyo on an epic expedition expected to last more than six months and see the Frenchman arrive in San Francisco.“I knew it was something that was part of me and my identity,” Lecomte told Reuters as his team undertook the final preparations to the support yacht in Yokohama’s Bayside Marina on Friday.“The way I look at it is as a way to express myself.“It didn’t happen very soon after the Atlantic (swim) because I got married, I had children, so I put that aside. But I knew I was going to come back to that project eventually.”The 50-year-old’s plan is to swim for eight hours a day, as well as consume over 8,000 calories, as he undertakes an extraordinary journey that is part-adventure and part-scientific experiment.Much of Lecomte’s backing comes from scientific publisher Seeker who will be providing daily updates on his progress as well as promoting research on the data collected by the support team.More than 27 different scientific organizations, some medical and some oceanographic, will be benefiting from the data gathered during the expedition.Much of the research will focus on plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, specifically the build-up of ‘plastic smog’ containing billions of pieces of microplastic.There is increasing concern among scientists about the effect of pervasive plastic pollution on marine ecosystems.For Lecomte, raising awareness of these issues is more important than setting any record.“I remember my father and he was the one who taught me how to swim in the Atlantic. I remember times when we would go on the beach and walk and never see any plastic. Now, everywhere I go, on the beach I see plastic everywhere,” said Lecomte.“If we are all aware of it then after it is much easier to take action and to change our behaviour because the solution is in our hands. We know what we have to do.”The Frenchman, whose Atlantic crossing was never ratified by Guinness World Records because it cannot be fully verified that he resumed his swims in the exact point he stopped them the day before, believes the mental battle will be tougher than the physical endurance.“It is mind over matter,” said Lecomte, who is also an architectural consultant based in Austin, Texas when not in the water.“To do the physical aspect of it, sure it is difficult and all that but what is much more difficult is to be in that very hostile environment, to do that days in and days out, to push you and to push your limits, then the mind has to be super strong.”To overcome this, Lecomte will make a strict plan for what he will think about for eight hours in the water each day.“The worst thing that can happen is not knowing what you are going to do with your mind and going to the wrong place,” he said.As well as mental challenges, Lecomte will have to endure turbulent and unpredictable weather, potentially freezing cold water, as well as sharks and jellyfish.However, right now, Lecomte just wants to get started.“I am a little bit like a tiger in a cage, ready to go.” – Bloomberg"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519215.1528128871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may must devise version of brexit backstop option says think tank","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prime minister Theresa May: she needs to table something on Brexit border that could work, meets commitments, and is politically acceptable. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesTheresa May should propose her own version of the Brexit backstop option for the Border ahead of this month’s EU summit in Brussels, according to an influential London think-tank.The Institute for Government’s report The Irish Border after Brexit says that while the UK has begun to propose future arrangements on issues like customs that could help avoid a hard border, they are not fully fleshed out and are unacceptable to the EU.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own. It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments, and is politically acceptable,” the report says.British officials have floated the possibility of a backstop that would apply to the whole of the UK, keeping it aligned with the EU on customs and regulations for goods. EU negotiators insist, however, that the proposed backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.“If it sticks to that line, the UK and the EU will need to explore the promised ‘innovative solutions’ either for the North – or the whole island of Ireland – that are both compatible with the joint report and do not upset the delicate unionist-nationalist balance of the Good FridayBelfast Agreement.“The UK could, for example, try reducing coverage to key sectors for cross-Border trade and try negotiating equivalence in specific areas – whereby the EU would accept that the UK was meeting the same outcomes but by different means. It could also propose that the backstop was overseen by whatever governance process is agreed for the Withdrawal Agreement rather than the EU institutions as now. The aim would be to remove the implication that Northern Ireland was separated from the rest of the UK and had become part of the EU’s customs territory and regulatory jurisdiction,” the report says.With EU officials warning that little progress has been made ahead of this month’s summit, government whips told Conservative MPs on Monday that the House of Commons would vote next week on amendments passed in the House of Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519949.1528181404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"manafort attempted to tamper with potential witnesses us special counsel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tManafort has been indicted in federal courts in Virginia and Washington DC with an array of allegations from money-laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent, to bank and tax fraud.

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyTwenty-seven minutes and Grenfell Tower fire had taken hold: so why weren\u0026#39t residents told to get out?Love Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsNicholas Parsons misses first Just a Minute show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy - but government faces battle in ParliamentMichael McIntyre robbed by muggers on a moped during school runGuatemala\u0026#39s Fuego volcano eruption: 69 dead and hundreds injured as lava surge sweeps through villagesMelania Trump reappears in public after three week absence sparked speculationWoody Allen says he \u0026#39should be the poster boy for the MeToo movement\u0026#39How the Moon\u0026#39s movements could give us Earthlings a 25-hour dayNew mobile heart attack test could give patients an instant all-clearGlobal 24-hour boycott on plastic packaging to fight ocean pollution begins in wake of \u0026#39Blue Planet effect\u0026#39Comment: The case of the gay wedding cake is why the religious Right keeps faith in Donald TrumpStarbucks chairman Howard Schultz to step down after 36 years amid speculation of presidential bidVersailles series three opens with more sex and more intrigue but it is still as cold and uninvolving as ever: episode one, reviewSuffragettes with Lucy Worsley, review: Worsley\u0026#39s love of dressing up was perfect for this timely history docu-dramaWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2017/09/07/TELEMMGLPICT000139348278_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?i","title":"male writers busy patting back actually write funny books","story":"Can women ever be funny writers?A strange thing happened a week ago at the Hay Festival.

Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one - big ones, famous ones, ones starting out - have ever, ever, suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”Woody Allen on set with Cate Blanchett, in Blue JasmineThe director was himself accused of sexual abuse in 2013, when his adopted daughter Dylan said he molested her in 1992, when she was seven. Allen has always vehemently denied the accusations, and told Jorge Lanata, one of Argentina’s most high-profile journalists, that Miss Farrow’s story was “crazy”.“This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue,” he said, in the Periodismo Para Todos interview, broadcast on Sunday night. “And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. “For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children. So of course it’s upsetting.” Dylan Farrow opens up to \u0026#34CBS This Morning\u0026#34 co-host Gayle King about her allegations that she was sexually abused by her father, Woody AllenThe claims resurfaced after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, in October. Since then, dozens of actors who previously worked with Allen — including Colin Firth, Rachel Brosnahan, Timothée Chalamet, Mira Sorvino and many more — have denounced the director and pledged not to work with him again.Allen said he was angered to be “lumped in with” people accused of being serial abusers, such as Weinstein.“What bothers me is that I get linked with them,” he said.  “People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse— and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people.”Pulitzer Prize winner for public service Ronan Farrow,The accusations against Allen have ided the family, as well as Hollywood.Last month another of Allen’s adopted children, Moses, wrote a lengthy blog post insisting his father was not guilty of any crime, and accusing Miss Farrow of making her story up. Miss Farrow is strongly supported, however, by her mother Mia Farrow and brother Ronan, a journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Weinstein accusations. Twenty-seven minutes and Grenfell Tower fire had taken hold: so why weren\u0026#39t residents told to get out?Love Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsNicholas Parsons misses first Just a Minute show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy - but government faces battle in ParliamentMichael McIntyre robbed by muggers on a moped during school runGuatemala\u0026#39s Fuego volcano eruption: 69 dead and hundreds injured as lava surge sweeps through villagesMelania Trump reappears in public after three week absence sparked speculationHow the Moon\u0026#39s movements could give us Earthlings a 25-hour dayNew mobile heart attack test could give patients an instant all-clearGlobal 24-hour boycott on plastic packaging to fight ocean pollution begins in wake of \u0026#39Blue Planet effect\u0026#39Comment: The case of the gay wedding cake is why the religious Right keeps faith in Donald TrumpStarbucks chairman Howard Schultz to step down after 36 years amid speculation of presidential bidVersailles series three opens with more sex and more intrigue but it is still as cold and uninvolving as ever: episode one, reviewSuffragettes with Lucy Worsley, review: Worsley\u0026#39s love of dressing up was perfect for this timely history docu-dramaUS Supreme Court rules in favour of Colorado baker who refused to make gay wedding cakeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"airlines profits drop fuel labour costs oil price interest rates iata","story":"Outlook for the industry could be harmed by uncertainty over Brexit and growing trend of protectionist policiesAirlines will make $5bn (£3bn) less profit than previously expected this year, and $4bn less than last year,\u0026nbspaccording to new forecasts by the International Air Transport Association. The IATA expects airlines to report a collective net profit of $33.8bn in 2018, and said this would be a “a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle”. The US central bank raised interest rates in March, and the Bank of England is widely expected to hike rates in the coming months.In addition, oil prices have been climbing in recent weeks, and in May broke past the $80 per barrel mark for the first time in three and a half years after President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The IATA said it expects the full-year average cost of Brent crude oil to be $70 per barrel, up 27.5 per cent from the average of $59.40 per barrel in 2017, while jet fuel prices are set to rise 25.9 per cent to $84 per barrel. The forecast net profit for this year has been revised down from a previous estimate of $38.4bn, and the IATA’s expected 2018 profit would also come in well below the record $38bn reported by airlines last year.The group also said operating profits, “though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs”.Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO, said: “Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. “At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors.”Meanwhile, growing uncertainty about global affairs “could present risks to the industry’s outlook”, according to the IATA. The group said particular risks included the advancement of political forces pushing a protectionist agenda, uncertainty following the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and a lack of clarity on the impact of Brexit.“Aviation spreads prosperity and enriches the human spirit. That truth lays the foundation for a very important message. The world is better off when borders are open to people and to trade. And our hard work as an industry has primed aviation to be an even stronger catalyst for an ever more inclusive globalization,” said Mr de Juniac.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood, open banking director at Barclays, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s a shame we can’t be more grown up about it, we aren’t asking for ra-ra skirts or skinny jeans, just grey tailored shorts for two months a year, it’s not a big deal.”Some other\u0026nbspparents also criticised the\u0026nbspnew uniform, which also introduced blazers, as they did not\u0026nbspfeel the clothing was appropriate for warmer months.\u0026nbspWith temperatures set to reach 26C this week, parents were keen for their children\u0026nbspto feel comfortable in the heat.The stricter clothing policy was one of the changes brought in since the school was placed in special measures, after receiving an “inadequate”\u0026nbsprating by Ofsted inspectors in spring last year.But the school appears to be making progress and the latest Ofsted monitoring inspection from November 2017, said: “Pupils value their new uniform, and they are smart and polite and most conduct themselves well.”\u0026nbspHeadteacher Moira Green, who also introduced longer teaching hours since taking on the role, was credited with helping to turn the school around.\u0026nbspShe explained that she decided to remove shorts from the uniform after a consultation, as it was decided more business-like attire was the way to go.Ms Green issued a statement which said: “In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success.”She added that the uniform policy was generic which meant that it could be purchased from anywhere, and the only piece of branded attire was a school tie, which was given to existing students for free.\u0026nbspThe issue, she said, was simply that shorts do not feature\u0026nbspas part of the main school uniform.\u0026nbspThe school – which was previously threatened with closure but has since been saved – will be turned into an academy and become part of the Maiden Erlegh Trust in August.Ms Green added: “Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even if it\u0027s old.The company\u0026nbspannounced iOS\u0026nbsp12, the new version of its operating software for iPhone and iPads. And while it did not include some of the dramatic features found in previous updates, it did include at least two profound changes.And as well as those, it introduced a raft of fun and meaningful new changes, designed to make the iPhone more fun. They include changes to animoji\u0026nbspand new features to improve the phone\u0027s augmented reality tools.But many of the features were intended to make people spend less time on their phone. The new software includes a variety of ways to do things more quickly, and new ways to remind you to get off your phone.Here\u0027s a full rundown of all the important changes introduced in iOS\u0026nbsp12, which will be released this year.Chief among the new features was something that wasn\u0027t really a feature at all. Instead, it was a promise from Apple to focus on the performance of the new software, ensuring that the phones running it do so quickly and without bugs.In particular, Apple will focus on ensuring that old phones are able to run the software as well as they can. Apple said that iOS\u0026nbsp12 improves the performance of the iPhone 6 – for example – dramatically, even when it is doing intensive processes.This has been a repeated complaint about new versions of iOS – and, anecdotally, one that gets louder every year. This should be the first time that your phone feels much faster after updating, as well as much more exciting.(Apple software boss Craig Federighi claimed that these speed boosts and performance improvements would be a worthy upgrade all by themself.)The other major upgrade was also focused on fixing problems rather than introducing new things. Apple\u0027s Screen Time feature is intended to make your phone a happier and healthier place to be – even if that means stopping you using it.Among other things, the phone will watch how you are using your apps and assemble that into graphs and charts with a whole array of probably shocking information: how often you use certain apps, and how often you pick up your phone. If you see something in there you don\u0027t like, you can set limits – so that your phone will kick you out of Instagram if you use it for more than an hour, for instance.It will concentrate on notifications, too. Apple will make it much easier to ignore them when they\u0027re not relevant to what you are doing, in an effort to stop them being quite so intrusive and distracting you from what you should really be getting on with.Apple is taking a swipe at ubiquitous share buttons created by Facebook and others to track your\u0026nbspbehavior\u0026nbsponline regardless of whether you click on them. The company says it\u0027s shutting down that tracking through its Safari browser in an update to Mac and\u0026nbspiOS\u0026nbspdevices, including\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads. Apple senior vice president Craig\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid such tracking would be blocked by default. Even if users click to share an item, they will get a prompt with an option to prevent subsequent tracking.\u0026nbspHe also said Apple would crack down on so-called fingerprinting, in which data companies identify specific devices by creating a unique fingerprint based on a device\u0027s particular configuration settings, installed fonts and plug-ins. Apple plans to instead send out generic data to such collectors, making a user\u0027s device look just like any other Apple device.\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid the changes will make it dramatically more difficult for data companies to identify you and track you.\u0026nbspLast year, Apple added intelligent tracking prevention that imposes time limits on tracking cookies and takes other measures to try to prevent advertising tech companies from following users around the web.\u0026nbspApple rolled out new support for augmented reality applications as it unveiled a new format for digital objects that appear to live in the real world.\u0026nbspThe update comes as Apple tries to extend AR experiences to a broader population, rather than just hard-core, tech-savvy users. The company started that effort last year when it built AR tools into most\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads by contrast, Google had limited that to niche Android phone models.Digital objects created with the new format, called\u0026nbspUSDZ, will work in Apple\u0027s Safari browser, Messages and Mail apps, meaning AR isn\u0027t limited to stand-alone apps that people choose to download separately. The format will also get support in Adobe\u0027s Creative Cloud suite of apps for professional photographers, videographers and designers. What remains to be seen is whether there is enough of a compelling reason for someone to use AR, even if it\u0027s built-in to everyday apps.\u0026nbspApple also unveiled an app called Measure that measures boxes and other objects in the real world by pointing the camera at them. Apple is also offering tools to give multiple users a different view of the same digital objects viewed from different angles.In iOS 12, the company\u0027s animated emoji which track a user\u0027s face, known as Animoji, have also been updated to include new animals, as well as the ability to detect when a tongue is being stuck out.A new version of the app, called Memoji, will now also enable users to create animated emoji of their own faces instead of using an animal face.Apple\u0027s video calling tools have barely changed at all since they were introduced in 2010.Now it will include a range of changes, chief among them the ability to speak to more than one person at once. In fact, you\u0027ll be able to speak to 32 people at once.All of that is done within a redesigned interface. When people speak, for instance, FaceTime spots it and ensures that the screen showing the person talking takes up more of the screen.And you can also use the animoji\u0026nbspdescribed above within a FaceTime call. That means you can stick the cartoon version of your face over the real one.Apple wants its digital assistant Siri to do more. Third-party apps will now be able to let users invoke Siri for commonly used tasks, much the way competing assistants from Google and Amazon long have. Before, Apple had limited third-party access to a handful of categories, such as messaging, while excluding competitors to Apple\u0027s Music service, for instance.\u0026nbspThe software update will also let people group similar tasks together into shortcuts that can be accessed by simple phrases like heading home. Saying the phrase can be set to open Apple Maps to find the best route home and launching a radio app.Apple will encourage users to share photos with their friends by suggesting such opportunities in a new for you tab. When a friend receives photos from an event, Apple will then suggest that the friend reciprocate with photos from the same event. It\u0027s similar to how Google already encourages sharing through its own Photos app for both iPhones and Android devices.\u0026nbspApple says all sharing will be done privately, using encryption already built into its Messages app.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To be fair to barmaid and soon to be professional celebrity daughter Dani Dyer, she was given a limited range of options to pick from (a reality with which she is about to become over-familiar).“Are you here for love or lust?” she was asked by host Caroline Flack, in what may also have been the first point at which the viewer was indulged with any meaningful sight of either the front or top halves of Love Island’s five, female enthusiastically bikini’d contestants, whose characters by this point had not been permitted to develop much beyond the ambulant backside stage.Though this will doubtless prove no obstacle to national sweetheartdom, Dann\u0026nbsptold barefaced lies with almost her very first words. For Dani, we learned, is “here for love.”So Dani is not here, definitely not, for paid for instagram endorsements and a five figure deal with Dancing on Ice.\u0026nbspIt was a\u0026nbspfurther ten minutes after that until Love Island was\u0026nbsptruly back on our screens in awful, wretched earnest. That moment came when Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor walked in and the now time honoured formula of fleshy\u0026nbsplab rat experiment in psycho-sexual cruelty came roaring back with that familiar sense of fear and joy and shame and loathing.Let’s be clear. It’s Alex’s fault. Alex is an A\u0026ampE doctor. Alex has a proper job, a middle class accent and an un-chiselled abdomen that screams ‘all this is beneath me’, which for the avoidance of doubt, it isn’t.“Step forward if you fancy Alex,” was the instruction given by presenter Caroline Flack to the five women, so quite why all five of them evidently heard the words as “Start digging and don’t stop til you see the Sydney Opera House” is a mystery presumably to be\u0026nbspsolved in later episodes.As Alex was moved to the “subs bench”, to watch the traditional parade of male models and semi-anthropomorphised eight packs go wild at the very pick and mix from which he had just forcibly ejected, one can only imagine the past horrors whirring behind his eyes that he would rather be living right now. Freak accidents with industrial machinery, high speed dashes through plate glass doors, that kind of thing.\u0026nbspBy tragic process of elimination, it was “musical theatre performer” Samira who was compelled to “couple up” with the not-so good doctor. And if you’re looking for a reason why “musical theatre performer”\u0026nbspSamira’s acting career has thus far not propelled her further than heavily implied contractual obligation to have night vision enhanced sex on ITV2, then it showed.It’s not like Alex won’t have seen that kind of mask of undisguised horror before, though traditionally he\u0026nbsphas a horrifically misshapen X-ray to hand.Still, Samira’s already done her bit in the name of public service, and that was this line of questioning, in which the lack of punctuation is definitely the model’s own. “So you work in A\u0026ampE then, that’s pretty intense how long have you been single?” As always with Love Island, the profundity is left unsaid and it was very clearly this: Absolutely no one is interested in your job mate. Keep it to yourself.Still, Cupid’s arrows have been fired. Eleven of them, simultaneously, at high speed, into a tiny circle\u0026nbspfrom point blank range, and one thing’s abundantly clear: absolutely no one’s wearing much in the way of body armour.Now\u0026nbspwe step back and watch the low rent Tarantino style bloodbath unfold.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

These variations are called\u0026nbspMilankovitch cycles and can even affect Earth\u0027s environment as they impact how sunlight is distributed on the planet.One of the ways Prof Meyer was able to make these calculations concerning Earth\u0027s rotation more than a billion years ago was by looking at the sediments in a 90 million-year-old rock and the information it gave him about the planet\u0027s climate cycles.The moon is believed to be moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82 centimetres a year, so it will be hundreds of millions of years before it has moved far away enough for humans to have to recalculate how long a day is.Using the geological artefacts along with the data about the speed at which the moon is moving away from Earth has allowed Prof Meyers to make more accurate predictions on Earth\u0027s history than every before.The geologic record is an astronomical observatory for the early solar system, he added.We are looking at its pulsing rhythm, preserved in the rock and the history of life.The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood, open banking director at Barclays, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They don’t see how it is relevant to where they are working now,” she said.\u0026nbsp“…We have got to create new models fit for the real working lives of young people and find those bridges into trade unionism because we know that’s the only way we are going to get better working lives for people.”Overall trade union membership is at its lowest level since 1995.Union leaders have blamed cuts to the public sector workforce, the rise of the gig economy and the reduction of “good-quality jobs” for the decline.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is the only politician from the right of the political spectrum to have led the country since the end of the First World War.If the right-wingers successfully form a government they would shift the balance of power on the European Council further to the populist right just as Italy, previously governed by a centre-left prime minister, gains a far-right coalition government.“I am not obliged to award the mandate to the relative winner of the election, but I will do so because I strongly believe in democracy,” president Borut Pahor told local media.It may prove difficult for Mr Janša’s party to form a majority in the highly fragmented field of parties, however. Preliminary results show the group came top by winning just 25 per cent of the vote and 25 out of 90 seats in the country’s parliament – with ideologically similar coalition partners thin on the ground in the historically progressive country.The far-right Slovenian nationalist party, a potential partner, has just four seats, while the Christian Democrats have seven – with practically all the other parties adhering to different flavours of liberalism or socialism. A pensioners interests party which won five seats participates in the outgoing government.A broad coalition of liberals and social democrats could hold a majority but would need at least five parties to participate in order to reach a majority.Right-wing nationalist parties have come to power in Hungary, Poland, Italy and Austria in recent years, representing a new bloc of largely anti-immigrant politics at a European level.Last week the far-right League party and their allies the anti-establishment Five Star Movement came to power in Italy on a promise to deport irregular migrantsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

They havent understood a thing.There is only one way to save these lives: fewer people leaving, more repatriations.Life is sacred and to preserve it we must ensure that people dont go to sea in dangerous tubs.There is not enough housing and work for Italians, let alone half the continent of Africa.The League leader also visited the port of Pozzallo where a boat with more than 150 African migrants landed last week after being rescued.On Saturday he declared the “good times for illegals are over” and warned them to “get ready to pack your bags”.This has been the destination for most of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years after setting off on smugglers boats from lawless Libya. Mr Salvini said: We have to improve deals with countries of origin.Earlier on the same day, he joined Premier Giuseppe Conte and the rest of the newly sworn-in Cabinet to view the Republic Day parade. Italys aeronautic acrobatic squad flew low and loud over downtown Rome trailing smoke in the red, white and green of the Italian flag.The national pride on display took on a particular significance this year after Italy ended three months of political and financial turmoil on Friday by swearing in a government whose populist and eurosceptic leanings have alarmed Europe.Conte, a law professor plucked from relative obscurity to head an unlikely governing alliance of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and League, said the celebrations transcended all the tensions of recent days.Its the celebration for all of us, of our republic, he said.Contes Cabinet was sworn in after a last-minute deal averted the threat of a new election that could have turned into a referendum on whether Italy stayed with the shared European euro currency.The political stability relieved financial markets on Friday.But Italys European neighbours continued to express concerns about the eurosceptic bent and the heavy spending agenda of Italys new government.Italy is destroying itself and dragging down Europe with it, read the headline of Germanys Der Spiegel magazine, the cover of which featured a forkful of spaghetti with one dangling strand tied up as a noose."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2478910.main_image-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"doctor who decapitated baby during delivery was nearing the end of a 24 hour shift","story":"Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, has been found guilty of medical misconduct after she oversaw the botched delivery on the maternity unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.Laxman should have given her 30-year old patient - who was delivering a premature infant in a breech position - the C-section.But instead she attempted to carry out the breech delivery naturally - just as a 24 hour shift was set to come to an end - with devastating results.She urged the patient to push while she applied traction to the premature babys legs. The manoeuvre caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached, leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head.It was ”re-attached” to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is believed the child was already dead before he was decapitated during the 15-minute delivery.Mr Tim Bradbury, chairing the tribunal, said: “The tribunal found that the breech extraction and consequent use of traction was necessitated by Dr Laxman’s earlier decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery and which is the subject of the tribunal’s finding.“Laxman’s conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation.“But for Laxman’s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.”He added that Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The womans waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mothers cervix was between 2-4cm dilated.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm.She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later while discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker.She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her too push.Last month consultant Laxman, who denied misconduct, said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out during the procedure on March 16 2014.She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester: “I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby.I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”Laxman qualified as a doctor in Chennai, India, in 1999.The mother – known only as Patient A – came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: “I don’t forgive you – I don’t forgive you” as the doctor stared down at the floor.The patient then looked away as Laxman’s QC apologised on her behalf.The mother added: “I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated.“I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn’t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.“Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman remains fit to continue practicing as a doctor."},{"url":null,"title":"russian tv news photoshops smile onto kim jong un as he meets top moscow official to make him appear happier","story":"The dictator met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday, just weeks before a planned meeting between the US and the North Korean regime.Although Kim did crack a smile during other parts of the meeting, the photos and footage of the moment he posed for the cameras during a handshake with Lavrov show him stony-faced.But a segment about the meeting during the programme News of the Week on pro-Putin TV station Russia 1 featured a still of Kim smiling alongside Lavrov.A photo of the same moment published on the official Twitter of the Russian Foreign Ministry also shows Kim looking grim-faced.Bloomberg Moscow deputy bureau chief Scott Rose tweeted: “Russian state TV, rising to the occasion, photoshopped a smile onto North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at his meeting with Lavrov.”The host of the show is Dmitry Kiselyov, who has been called a Putin propagandist and claims the US is in league with terror group ISIS.Lavrov became the first top-ranking Russian to meet with the current head of North Korea.The pair met ahead of the much talked about meeting between Trump and Kim scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.The Foreign Minister reportedly invited Kim Jong-un to Russia.In return Kim thanked him for the invitation and asked him to convey his greetings to Vladimir Putin and the Russian people.Russia 1 has been contacted for a comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict0004107702471.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m1 underpass blocked travellers rubbish","story":"Shocking photographs show how litter has completely blocked the underpass at junction 12 near Flitwick, Beds.And at 2pm, motorists driving vans were seen towing caravans from the site and police said no arrests had been made.It is unclear whether the group will be investigated after the mess was left by the roadside.Bedfordshire Council is now expected to be left with a huge bill as they begin the mammoth task of cleaning the area.It comes after taxpayers spent a staggering £57million in 2017 to clean fly-tipping sites around the country.Highways England today said they had staff down at the site and are looking at how long it will take to clear.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “Highways England served notice last week on a group of travellers at junction 12 of the M1 for them to move on, giving them until today.“They are now in the process of moving away from this site.“Highways England has now been able to get staff on site and have requested for our contractors to attend urgently to assess the situation, provide an estimate for when it can be cleared by and the cost of this.“We already collect vast amounts of litter from motorways and major trunk roads every year, but we’d much rather be spending our time carrying out other essential maintenance work.“Fly-tipping causes a hazard to drivers, our workers, the community and wildlife, and we will look to recover costs of this where possible.”Councils are hoping to crack down on fly-tipping and have said that those that do could be prosecuted.Penalties for fly-tipping were increased after the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.It is now a criminal offence and those who are found guilty face a fine of up to £50,000 or 12 months imprisonment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000407541881.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle joins queen royal engagements without harry","story":"The new Duchess of Sussex will accompany the Queen at a theatre opening and a lunch in Chester next week.The pair will have a jam-packed schedule as the 36-year-old new royal and her grandmother-in-law will also open the Mersey Gateway Bridge.This will be Meghans first official event without Prince Harry by her side.The newly married couple havent been seen in public since Prince Charles 70th birthday bash -

In contrast, the creative sector has 15 supporting staff.It also said the department is packed with “career civil servants”, who lack the necessary skills or experience.And the maritime experts said a lack of resources and poor prioritisation had put UK’s ambition to become a global trading nation after Brexit under threat.Maritime UK chief Ben Murray concluded that Mr Fox’s department is in danger of throwing away the “tremendous opportunities” that Brexit offers Britain.He blasted: “Within the DIT, there is currently a chronic lack of direct industry experience. While the department has taken steps to take on a new crop of Trade Commissionaires in response to the increased workload, a huge percentage of these are career civil servants.“How can we possibly expect individuals who have spent their lives outside of industry to understand the real requirements of UK business wanting to sell overseas?

Thousands have died in bombings and attacks against them carried out by the Myanmar military - and these attacks have increased substantially since January after the same forces had spent months driving the Rohingya out from the west of the country.A number spoke of attacks in or near civilians who had taken shelter in the camps for displaced people dotted across the region.Lashi \u0026#211kawn Ja, a mother of four now living in one of the dozens of camps in the north of Myanmar, told Sky News: \"I am convinced the Burmese government is trying to ethnically cleanse the Kachin people.\"Whenever they see Kachin people they try to kill us and they rape the women, even the women who are pregnant.\"The vice president of the Kachin Independence Council (KIC), General Sumlut Gunmaw, also believes Myanmar\u0027s authorities want to crush them.\"Maybe their actions against us are not so sudden as their violence against the Rohingya, but their intentions are just the same.

The attacks against the Kachin are random and indiscriminate.They are mostly done from the air or by using artillery.The Myanmar military has targeted some of the many amber and jade mines in the area, which serve as a valuable source of income for the Kachin people.These mines have funded their rebellion and enabled them to buy weapons by trading with their foreign neighbours.The vice president said he had handed over several documents detailing the violence and the repeated attacks against Kachin civilians to British and UN diplomats but the allegations of war crimes had been ignored."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs emily maitlis reveals skewered","story":"NewsBBC\u0027s Emily Maitlis reveals why she skewered \u0027coward\u0027 Theresa May over Grenfell in painful interviewThe Newsnight host admitted it was the angriest friends have ever seen her - but said she still had sympathy with the Prime Minister\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter00:01, 5 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEmily Maitlis has opened up about why she skewered Theresa May over the Grenfell fire in a disastrous TV interview. The BBC presenter angrily confronted the Prime Minister following the disaster last June - a clash that left Mrs May floundering and branded inhuman on social media. Speaking to Radio Times Magazine, the Newsnight host admitted: Friends told me it was the angriest they had ever seen me. The reason I went so hard that day was because - I think - I had heard and seen the anger first hand, she said. This was no longer an intellectual exercise. But Maitlis, who volunteered by sorting donations before broadcasting from the scene, said she still felt sympathy for Mrs May. The Prime Minister faced a huge public backlash last year for failing to immediately meet victims of the disaster that killed 72 people. In a second visit an angry crowd surrounded her car and screamed “coward” and “May must go”.  During the painful interview, Maitlis told the PM: You misread the public mood on this one. You misread the anger that people feel about this. They shouted coward after you this afternoon. In robotic fashion, May answered: What I have done since this incident took place is, first of all yesterday, ensure that public services had the support that they needed in order to be able to do the job they were doing in the immediate aftermath. Maitlis interjected: But that\u0027s three days on, Prime Minister, this is Friday evening. They needed those things in place on Wednesday. No one was in charge.   Looking back a year after the fire, Maitlis said: Let me say here, for the record, that actually I had enormous sympathy for Theresa May that day. She looked spent and exhausted a week after a failed election, a summer of terrorism and tragedy on this inconceivable scale. Maitlis said that the tragedy horrified and disturbed me for many nights to come. She added: Survivors were turning up, shell-shocked and looking for someone to tell them what to do, where to go. There were very few people in authority there. That day was powered by volunteers - amazing people who got their act together when no-one else seemed to have a clue what to do.

The Labour leader will launch a stinging attack on the Prime Minister when he addresses the GMB union annual conference in Brighton. The Tory leader last night told the US President she was “deeply disappointed” at his “unjustified” decision to slap 25% duties on imports from countries including Britain. Experts warn the move could jeopardise thousands of jobs in the fragile British industry, WHICH exported \u0026pound360million worth of steel to America last year. In a 30-minute phone call, Mrs May vowed to tackle Mr Trump on the taxes when the pair meet at this week’s G7 summit in Canada. A No10 spokesman said: “The Prime Minister said the US, UK and EU are close national security allies and we recognise the importance of the values of open and fair trade across the world.  “The Prime Minister also underlined the need to safeguard jobs that would potentially be affected by the decision.” Mr Corbyn will today taunt Mrs May over a series of transatlantic spats with the White House. He is due to say: “The Tory Government’s timid response shamefully fails to stand up to Trump ... The Tories are too weak to stand up to the powerful, and too in hock to them even if they wanted to. “Theresa May is appeasing Donald Trump in the hope of getting a race-to-the-bottom trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. “The Trump trade tariffs show that’s a Tory pipe-dream.”  A senior Labour MP urged the Government to clobber Mr Trump with tariffs over his Scottish golf courses. John Mann hit out after International trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would work with the EU on its response to the President’s tariffs. Urging the Government to “fight him”, Mr Mann told the Commons: “I can’t believe what I’m hearing. “It’s a good job steelworkers and steel communities didn’t wave the white flag when they’d been called upon repeatedly to defend our shared values with the US over the last 100 years. “The only language that Trump understands is people fighting back - it’s about time this country fought back. “We can do it - golf.

The 59-year-old says she had consulted with neighbours before installing the \u0026pound2,500 home improvement. Under council law, any decking more than 30 centimetres above the ground requires planning approval. Ms Duffy\u0027s was around 70 centimetres high. The ex-council worker was staggered when she found out a neighbour had complained about the decking and that she was being taken to court for breaching local planning rules.  Retrospective planning permission and subsequent appeals were both refused on the grounds of the impact on neighbouring residents in Westhoughton, Greater Manchester. Ms Duffy was fined and ordered to reinstate the decking to its maximum permitted height. Despite complying with the ruling, the retired former Bolton Council employee says she has been left disappointed and bewildered by the prosecution. Ms Duffy pleaded guilty to the offence at Bolton Magistrates Court last week and was handed a conditional discharge.  She was also ordered to pay \u0026pound125 towards the council\u0027s investigation, a \u0026pound200 contribution towards costs and a \u0026pound20 victim\u0027s surcharge. Ms Duffy said the decking was first installed in June 2016 without objection after consulting with neighbours. A court heard she had consulted with her neighbours on either side who were happy the decking would enhance the area at the back of her home. But it came as a shock when another neighbour complained about the decking.  Prosecutor Marcus Hirst told the court Ms Duffy had failed to respond to a letter sent in February this year requesting further information about how the enforcement notice had been complied with. She was prosecuted by Bolton Council for failing to comply with regulations. Ms Duffy told a court she had not deliberately broken the rules, as she believed the platform was at ground level - and had delayed lowering while seeking further advice. She has since had the platform lowered from 70 centimetres to the 30 centimetres permitted together with a step up - at a cost of more than \u0026pound300.  Speaking after the hearing, Ms Duffy said: Unfortunately I had it done too high, I didn\u0027t realise I had to have planning permission for decking. I realise I didn\u0027t comply, but my factors were I didn\u0027t know what was considered ground level, I thought my house was at ground level, I didn\u0027t realise planning would be needed. The aim was to make the garden more accessible as I have friends with mobility problems, I didn\u0027t wilfully break the law. I spent \u0026pound900 on planning consultants to give me advice and I put in another planning application, but unfortunately that didn\u0027t come to fruition.  Ms Duffy said she felt she had valid reasons for not complying with the enforcement notice sooner: I was surprised, I think it\u0027s nonsense, but I have to say I was found guilty of not complying with an enforcement notice. I\u0027m surprised it went to these lengths as it\u0027s decking we\u0027re talking about. The reason I didn\u0027t think I should have put an application in is that, to me, it\u0027s at ground level. I admit I didn\u0027t comply with the enforcement notice, but I was making further investigations and taking further advice to backup my views and if I could keep the decking.

Little Nathan suffered serious burns as the molten plastic fused to his skin, while he was simply playing football with a friend. Police and firefighters were called to Hulton Lane Playing Fields in Bolton following the incident on Saturday evening.  Nathan\u0027s mum Shivonne Flynn told the Manchester Evening News that a group of teenagers had been setting fires nearby, but hadn’t paid much attention to the two boys.  When the youngsters’ football rolled in their direction, Nathan went to pick it up.  It’s understood one of the teenagers – said to be aged about 14 to 15 – began talking to him before starting to stamp out a fire with his foot. “He was talking to him quite nicely to start with,” mum-of-three Shivonne said. “He started to stamp out the fire with his foot, then he picked up a plastic bottle that was on fire and launched it at Nathan. “It hit his arm and the molten plastic stuck to him. He tried to use his hand to get it off and burnt his hand as well.” The young boys then ran to a house on nearby Edge Hill Road and were looked after by a couple who called his mother. Police and fire crews also attended, and a trauma technician from Bolton Central fire station treated Nathan and dressed his arm before Shivonne took him to Bolton Royal Hospital. The 30-year-old mum added: “He’s been back to hospital this morning (Monday) and had the dressing taken off his hand. It’s blistered, but it’s his arm they’re more worried about.  “They‘re concerned about scarring and infection. “Things could have been so much worse. The plastic melted to his t-shirt. Nathan could have gone up in flames and these kids need to know and understand that it is serious, and could have resulted in so much more than burns. “There was no reason for what they did. They weren’t being horrible to him, but then all of a sudden there was a split second switch from good to evil.”  Shivonne shared a photo of her son bandaged up on Facebook urging parents to remind their children about the dangers of playing with fire.

Richard Smith, the surgeon planning to carry out the first transplant in the UK, has set the two-year target and revealed that his medical team now plans to use living donors. He hopes the first transplants will take place before the end of this year thanks to a pioneering medical technique, but \u0026pound30,000 is needed for every patient. Three women hoping to realise their dreams of motherhood will undergo surgery within the next few months using wombs donated by a mother or sister, it was reported.  Doctors in the UK were granted approval to carry out Britain\u0027s first 10 womb transplants in 2015 using wombs from deceased donors whose hearts are still functioning. But Mr Smith, a consultant gynaecologist who leads researchers at the charity Womb Transplant UK, said his team will now use both live and deceased donors.  Mr Smith, of Queen Charlotte\u0027s and Chelsea Hospital in London, told the BBC that retrieving a womb from a live donor is now simpler and safer than it was just a few years ago.  The surgery time has been drastically reduced from 12 to four hours.  Mr Smith said the risks of clot formation, deep vein thrombosis and damage to pelvic organs have been greatly reduced. About 750 women have contacted his team to enquire about womb transplantation. Mr Smith\u0027s team has been in contact with about 50 potential recipients after a preliminary selection process, and the patients will be chosen within weeks. They include women with relatives willing to donate their wombs. Womb Transplant UK is hoping to complete 15 transplants - five with living, related donors - but so far only has enough funds to pay for three operations.

The 42-year-old quickly became a prominent member of the English Defence League after joining following the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.   He was jailed in 2015 along with more than 50 other members after a riot in Birmingham, reports the ChronicleLive .  Following his release, the former heroin addict has vowed to turn his back on both drugs and crime. From his Newcastle home Anthony has told how he was sucked into the EDL - and that he wants nothing to do with it.  He said: “It became an addiction to replace the drugs. I’m angry with myself that I was sucked into it. “People talk about ISIS radicalising young Muslims, but at the same time the EDL are doing exactly the same thing. They radicalise the young but they are doing it with patriotism not religion. “I was there for the right reasons, there were others that weren’t. 90% are probably racist, but it didn’t start out that way. I do not consider myself to be racist.” Anthony, whose life has been dominated by crime and drug addiction, discovered the EDL after he was released from prison. While inside, his partner Carrieanne Downs and baby daughter Zeva Tia had died. “When Lee Rigby was (killed) it influenced me in a big way,” said Anthony, who gained a sociology degree while in jail, explained. “That’s when I started looking into the groups. Then when the EDL had a march in Newcastle I thought, ‘Who are these people?’  “I started to look into them and find out about their ethos and I agreed with it. “I still agree with that ethos now, and if they had stayed true to that I would probably still be a member.” Anthony began attending local EDL meetings and quickly rose through the ranks. “I felt as though I had to be a speaker for the EDL,” he said. However Anthony, trying to recover from his heroin dependency at the time, now admits he may have been swapping one addiction for another when he threw himself into the EDL.  And when the group planned a demo in Birmingham in July 2013, the dad was determined to attend. “I wanted to be there on the front line,” he said. “I wanted to be a part of it. Probably for the wrong reasons. It became an addiction to replace the drugs.” But once he was at the rally Anthony says he saw a lot of people that did not seem to be there to promote the EDL ethos he had signed up to. And he believed many members simply wanted to act like hooligans and take on riot police. Anthony was among more than 50 people charged with violent disorder in connection with the march, during which EDL members ran riot in Birmingham’s Centenary Square, hurling missiles and injuring a number of police officers. As he awaited sentence, Anthony ran into local Muslim councillor Dipu Ahad in Newcastle’s West End. Coun Ahad offered to write the judge a letter of support if Anthony vowed to turn his back on the EDL.  Anthony agreed, and the reference helped knock three months off his prison sentence when he was jailed for 21 months. But associating with Coun Ahad made the EDL turn on Anthony, who was accused of fraternising with the enemy, he said. “I still get abuse for that now,” he said. “I always thought of him [Coun Ahad] as the enemy. We thought he was the enemy and the Chronicle and the media were the enemy. “But it was literally a two-second conversation. He offered to write a letter, but I didn’t know what it said. “But it did make it easy for me to leave the EDL. I was told I had ‘broken bread with the enemy’. People thought I had been working with Dipu all along, and I can understand why they thought that. “The far-right had a lot to say about it. They questioned my loyalties and my views.”  During his time inside, Anthony began to feel as if the EDL was no longer true to its original ethos. He believes the group preys on people’s loneliness and insecurities, and now wants no part of it. He said: “The EDL makes people feel as though they belong. If you are an EDL member you can go anywhere in the country and find someone to have a pint with. “All of sudden you are in a big gang, you have a lot of friends.” Since leaving prison, Anthony says he has been asked to front-up other far-right groups.

And that means the Duchess of Sussex will be ditching hubby Prince Harry less than a month after their glittering wedding. But the functions will be a massive boost for her fledgling royal career. Meghan first accompanies the Queen to open the Mersey Gateway Bridge in Widnes, Cheshire. She will then return to her acting roots to formally open the Storyhouse cultural centre in Chester. And finally they will attend a lunch in Chester Town Hall.  Meghan, 36, has previously accompanied the Queen on engagements – such as the Commonwealth Day service in March – but then there were also other royals in attendance. Sources suggest the plan is to capitalise on Meghan’s huge popularity, and getting her “front of house” with the Queen on June 14 will surely delight the crowds in Cheshire. She thrilled guests at her first event as a royal – Prince Charles’ 70th birthday bash at Buckingham Palace garden party – just days after her wedding.

The 32-year-old told Bristol Live she hears \u0027squishing noises in her head like she is drowning\u0027 and her own heartbeat is a constant banging.  The Bristol woman is now totally dependant on carers to carry her out of her wheelchair and bed and she eats liquid meals through a tube.

But in 2013, when doctors discovered the structural defects in the base of the skull and cerebellum, - the part of the brain that controls balance - and she was told without an operation she could have less than two months to live. Since the surgery, she says her life is now unbearable and she fears she cannot continue living with such intense pain every day. Her only hope is to travel to America - a world leader when it comes to treating Chiari Malformation - and undergo more opertions. However, for this she needs to raise a staggering \u0026pound72,000.

Despite this when the Daily Mirror received a dramatic telephone call at 10.15am on May 1, 1968 no-one could have predicted the tale which would emerge. A man said he wanted to talk about a friend and a serious crime. He was to solve a mystery which had baffled police who had been called to a countryside cottage where firefighters had found a body. The mystery caller said he would arrive at the office in about fifteen minutes. At 10.30am, the man arrived at the main door in London\u0027s Holborn and was shown to a third floor waiting room.  He was scruffily dressed and looked tired. In quiet, jerky sentences, he told about a crime that he said he knew had been committed. He said he had a friend who knew all about a murder and he was waiting at London Bridge railway station. At first, he would not give his name, but as details tumbled out he could not keep up his pretence. There is no friend, it is me, he confessed. He was 28-year-old Hungarian chef Imre Gathy, and he described how on the Saturday before he had left his wife and two young children, at home in Harrington Road, Brighton. He said he had rowed with his wife after losing his job and had set out to look for work.  As he walked out of the seaside town along the A23 towards Gatwick a car pulled up. Inside was a man who it later transpired was retired naval Lieutenant Commander Humphrey Gilbert Grace. Grace had had a religious conversion almost a decade before when his mother had died suddenly. While he was away at the funeral his younger son was blinded in one eye in an accident. Since then, he had developed a fondness for picking up down and outs and taking them back his family home while his wife was away.  On this weekend Mr Grace\u0027s wife and teenage daughter were on holiday in Greece and two sons at boarding school when he offered Gathy a lift. The 29-year-old got into the green 1965 Morris Mini-traveller and the pair drove off towards Gatwick. As they got near Gatwick, Gathy said he asked to be dropped off as he knew the manager of the airline canteen. But Grace said that he could call him from his nearby home, and so they drove to October House. Once inside Gathy said he had a wash and called his friend at Gatwick Airport at 4pm, but it was his day off. He had tea with Grace, and, according to Gathy, the retired naval officer started to talk about God and read from the Bible until about 11pm.  Grace then showed his guest to a bedroom, which was a back room with a single bed where he slept until the morning. The next morning, Gathy said that he wanted to contact his wife, but claims that Grace said that he should let her wait adding that the man should wear the trousers. Reports at the time said that Gathy claimed later that Grace came out directly talking about the subject of homosexuality, saying that the Bible spoke of \u0027Love thy neighbour\u0027 - he took it to mean that you could love another man like your wife. He claimed Grace\u0027s response was to put his hand on the top of his leg. Gathy said he struck Grace with the back of his fist and that the older man jumped up and started shouting and screaming. He said that he then came towards him and he fell out of the back of his chair. Gathy said he grabbed a doorstop and hit the commander over the head - killing him. He said he panicked, and thinking he would make the crime look like a robbery, stole some silverware and fled back to Brighton. He twice tried to set fire to the house where he had killed Mr Grace, but the fire did not take and smoke was spotted by neighbours who alerted fire fighters who found the body. Gathy said he decided to hand himself in, but instead of going to the police station called the Daily Mirror to confess.

She told the Daily Star at the time: I\u0027ve had lots of messages from admirers. Most of them asking for dates or sex.  I\u0027ve even had some people asking to marry me.

Trump tonight issued a statement uninviting the Philadelphia Eagles from a White House visit due to the ongoing kneeling row. He claimed he was taking the decision because not all of the team were planning on attending and \u0027the fans deserve better\u0027. But Philly\u0027s mayor Jim Kenney wasn\u0027t going to take that lying down, and hit back with a strongly worded statement of his own.  He said: The Eagles call the birthplace of our democracy home, so it\u0027s no surprise that this team embodies everything that makes our country and our city great. Their athletic accomplishments on the field led to an historic victory this year. Fans all across the country rallied behind them because we like to root for the underdog and we feel joy when we see the underdogs finally win. I\u0027m proud of the Eagles\u0027 activism off the field. These are players who stand up for their causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation - a nation in which we are free to express our opinions. Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our President is not a true patriot but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend. City Hall is always open for a celebration.  Trump has repeatedly insisted players should stand during the national anthem at the start of football games, while a number of players in the last year have taken a knee in protest against police violence against Africans Americans. Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith previously said he wouldn\u0027t be going - and has hit out at Trump\u0027s statement tonight.  The Trump statement says: The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists they stand proudly for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honour of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony - one that will honour our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem. I will be there at 3pm with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus to celebrate America. Shortly after, Smith tweeted the following, accusing the president of being a liar.   The Eagles claimed the NFL\u0027s biggest prize in February, defeating last year\u0027s champions New England Patriots 41-33 in Minnesota. Days later it emerged a number of players would boycott the trip to the White House to meet President Trump, following their Super Bowl success. Many players in the NFL have been critical of President Trump\u0027s comments on race relations, with the president labelling the league weak and out of control back in October.

Mr Hughes is understood to have been staying at Magaluf’s Universal Hotel Florida, close to the Eden Roc block. Sources at the local Civil Guard, the force investigating Mr Hughes in conjunction with a local court, said today they believed the death was a tragic accident. One said: “Investigators suspect he may have mistaken the building he fell from with his hotel which is just a couple of doors away and jumped over a wall at the end of a corridor thinking the corridor continued the other side.  “The only thing the other side of the wall was a drop of around 65 feet. “Investigations are continuing but there is nothing at this stage to suggest his death was the result of a crime and suicide appears to have been ruled out.” The results of the autopsy - which was due to be carried out today in the island capital Palma - have not been revealed. Police have not said what time they think he died and whether he had been drinking in the run-up to the tragedy. He had only arrived in Majorca with friends the day before he was found dead.  Friends took to Facebook to express their shock at what had happened.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b11714d7de2f.jpg ","title":"driving offences

fantastic, from the youngest being four to the oldest 77, we had a great time with a lovely group of people.Music a big part of life for Dundee music tutor\u0026#8220Each person was given the opportunity for free to try as many music lessons as they wanted in guitar, piano, drums, bass and singing.\u0026#8221He said the feedback had been great, with lots of the people who attended booking in the following week for lessons.\u0026#8220But the most important thing for us was seeing the enjoyment and happiness people felt whilst taking their lessons,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Our team of tutors had a great weekend passing on some of their knowledge and after 22 hours of teaching for free they all agreed that they found it so rewarding that they would do it again!\u0026#8220So we have decided that we should host this type of event numerous times throughout the year.\u0026#8220In fact we noticed that lots of people missed out on the chance to get a free music lesson due to prior commitments and variety of different reasons so we want to offer everyone at any time the chance to book in a try a first lesson for free with any of our tutors.\u0026#8221He said the benefits of playing music were \u0026#8220incredible\u0026#8221.\u0026#8220Everyone loves music, it’s one of life’s greatest gifts but few know just how mentally, physically and emotionally rewarding it is to play an instrument.\u0026#8220Playing an instrument increases memory, enhances coordination, teaches discipline, perseverance and patience, builds confidence, sharpens your concentration, relieves stress and allows self-expression, it creates a sense of achievement as you develop your ability, and there are so many more benefits but most of all, it’s make you happy and everyone deserves to feel

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted. The Stratton development has been approved and is in accordance with the local development plan.\"Tuesday 5 Jun 2018 8:36

I enjoyed Peru as well, it was brilliant and something that I’ll definitely learn from.”The Scots found it tough against the World Cup-bound Mexicans whose side contained the likes of ex-Barcelona and Tottenham player Giovani dos Santos, former Arsenal man Carlos Vela and Barcelona legend Rafael Marquez.The performance of Shinnie at left-back and Don Scott McKenna skippering the team in just his fourth cap were two positives.Shinnie added: “We were trying to keep our shape as best we could.“We knew that they would move and pass the ball about well so when we turned the ball over we were trying to keep it ourselves and get ourselves forward.“It was tough to do it, but when we did do it, especially second half, we had a good go.“We’re disappointed, Oli McBurnie has one off the post and we were desperate for it to go in.“But I think second half we definitely came into it more and got forward a lot more and created a lot more problems.”Conditions were gruelling with the stadium in Mexico City being 7,200 feet above sea level. Shinnie said: “It was tough, at one point in the first half I felt like I was swallowing sand.“It was good, it’s different experiences and it’s something that I’ll potentially never experience again.”Scotland boss Alex McLeish has been pleased with the trip to South America overall, despite the losses to both Peru and Mexico.The Gothenburg Great said: “The trip has been great, the players have been very professional.“Normally they would be on their holidays. We would love to be going to the World Cup the same as Mexico.“But we have played a couple of games that can help us build for the future.“It was a very tough game for us at altitude and in these conditions.“I think the players that we had out there did the country proud.“We are trying to get better on the technical side and we have asked the players to look at their game and be brave, to make passes and receive passes.“It’s a big part of the plan going forward.”One frustration for McLeish was Scotland’s lack of threat in attack.He added: “We looked to be more of a threat, to get players forward in the box. I felt that we never had the best of deliveries. When we got into wide areas, we hit the first man a lot when we had good presence in the box.“You saw when we got a good cross in the second half, McBurnie had a good header, he was unlucky he hit the post. In the first-half, we had crosses potentially for the strength of Callum Paterson but we didn’t quite succeed.“Both teams made changes, that can upset the rhythm of the game, but both teams did what they could to impress the fans and the coaches.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie and mckenna earn pass marks for scotland as manager mcleish takes first strides on road to lifting hopes of a

famous Azteca Stadium with the only real positives being McKenna as skipper and another solid display from Dons captain Graeme Shinnie who played the whole game.The superiority of the World Cup-bound Mexicans was clear with the Scots only creating one clear-cut opportunity in what was a largely forgettable 90 minutes for the Tartan Army as they watched a team lacking in creativity.The merits of Scotland’s trip to South America at the end of a long season have to be questioned – but the tour has been a successful one for the Dons in Alex McLeish’s squad.Pittodrie skipper Shinnie has finally been given his opportunity and he has shown what many of us have known for a while: that he is capable of playing at international level.While McKenna’s fairy tale continues.The 21-year-old had already had a dream season breaking into the Aberdeen team and winning his first two caps for the national side in March.But on this trip McKenna has doubled his tally to four and has now captained Scotland.Gothenburg Great McLeish seems keen to build his defence going forward into the Uefa Nations League and the European Championship qualifiers around McKenna.He clearly has total confidence in the youngster and for McKenna to skipper the Dark Blues in just his fourth cap is an incredible achievement and he was one of Scotland’s best performers in what was a disappointing display.He is following in the footsteps of Aberdeen legends like Martin Buchan, Willie Miller, McLeish and Jim Leighton in captaining his country.Seven changes were made to the side which lost 2-0 to Peru in Lima last Wednesday morning.Jordan Archer, Charlie Mulgrew, Lewis Stevenson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Jamie Murphy and Matt Philips dropped out.McLeish drafted in keeper Jon McLaughlin, Jack Hendry, Shinnie, Johnny Russell, Callum Paterson, former Dons loanee Ryan Christie and Oliver McBurnie to start.The changes were necessary due to the heat in the famous Azteca Stadium as well as the altitude, with the ground being 7,200 feet above sea level.But after only 13 minutes the Scots found themselves trailing.Edson Alvarez crossed from the right, Giovani dos Santos slipped the ball on to Carlos Vela just inside the area, he turned and Hendry’s slip allowed the former Arsenal man to square for Dos Santos who fired a low shot past McLaughlin from 18 yards with his left foot.The Scots were struggling to get the ball and string more than two passes together as the first period wore on.Former Aberdeen man Kenny McLean was the only player in Scotland’s midfield who seemed to have the confidence to try to keep possession and build attacks.Mexico could have doubled their lead just before the half hour when Miguel Layun’s 25-yard curler came back off the right post.McLaughlin made a decent save from Hirving Lozano’s long-range effort as the one-way traffic towards Scotland’s goal continued.At the start of the second period sub keeper Scott Bain made saves from Lozano and Hector Herrera in the opening 70 seconds.Then on 49 minutes McBurnie hit the right post with a powerful header from 10 yards after Russell crossed from the right.After not creating a chance in the first half this was more promising from the Scots.But on 53 minutes they were fortunate not to concede when Mexico broke at speed from a Scotland corner.At the end of the move Vela was free and could have shot but opted to cut back for Layun, but Shinnie and Bain smothered his effort.Scotland were given another let-off with 25 minutes left when Lozano blasted off the crossbar from 10 yards after getting away from sub Charlie Mulgrew.Sub Oribe Peralta had the ball in the Scots net with 18 minutes left but he was flagged offside.Despite Scotland’s best efforts in the closing stages they were unable to salvage a draw.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"wren kitchens open new store","story":"NewsWren Kitchens to open new store at Ayr retail parkThe firm will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:38, 30 MAY 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new tenant is to take up residence in Ayr’s out-of-town shopping park.

The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

development proposals to be brought forward in line with the Local Development Plan, which was updated by the Council last year.\nCouncillors met today to discuss the proposal, a private item at the full Council meeting due to the inclusion of commercially sensitive information.\nLocal plans are informed by the Tweedbank Masterplan which identifies the potential for new residential and business space development on Lowood Estate, as part of a wider Tweedbank expansion proposal, which would seek to attract existing and new residents and businesses moving into the area, including those who would wish to use the nearby Borders Railway as a key transport mode.\nThe prospectus also identifies opportunities to expand Tweedbank village and reposition the current industrial estate as a new Borders Innovation Park.\nThe Tweedbank Masterplan was developed as part of the Borders Railway Blueprint Programme, and was carried out at the same time as a similar piece of work on Galashiels.\u0026nbsp\nBoth these masterplans, which are available on the Council\u0026rsquos website, present a variety of proposals to encourage people to live, learn, visit and work in the area, as well as attract inward investment through public and private investment and partnership working.\nCouncillor Mark Rowley, SBC\u0026rsquos executive member for business and economic development, with responsibility for housing, said: \u0026ldquoAny discussions and negotiations around the purchase of land is clearly commercially sensitive and therefore we cannot go into detail, however following discussions and background work over a period of time the Council has now taken the opportunity to get a decision from Elected Members to proceed to more formal negotiations with the owners of the estate.\n\u0026ldquoThere are clear benefits to this strategic site being in the Council\u0026rsquos ownership and control in terms of facilitating the development of the land in line with the Local Development Plan and future proofing for the extension of the Borders Railway.\n\u0026ldquoClearly this is a long-term strategy, and negotiations around the potential purchase of the site are a first step, and one which must be handled sensitively and dealt with in private.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Biggest and best Junior Rideout yet in Selkirk","story":"ORGANISERS of the fourth Selkirk Junior

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

campaign by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde to bring them back from Europe.The intricate bowls, woven baskets and other pieces were collected by the Rev Robert W Summers, an Episcopal minister who bought them from tribal members in the 1870s and sold them to a colleague. The colleague later gifted the objects to the British institution.A spear head collected by the Rev Robert Summers (Gillian Flaccus/AP)The Rise of the Collectors exhibit, on display at the Chachalu Tribal Museum and Cultural Centre in Grand Ronde, also includes basketry collected by Dr Andrew Kershaw, who worked on the reservation in the 1890s as a doctor and agent for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Together, the two collections are part of a larger plan by the Grand Ronde to reclaim and examine its history for future generations \u0026mdash a mission that echoes efforts by other tribes around the United States. Two years ago, a Parisian auction house withdrew a ceremonial shield from an auction after the Acoma Pueblo, a tribe in rural New Mexico, moved to halt its sale. And tribes from Alaska to Connecticut have used a US law passed in 1990 to reclaim Native American remains and sacred or funerary objects.The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde wanted the objects back permanently, but worked out an initial year-long loan because a full return of items from the British Museum requires parliamentary action, said David Harrelson, manager of the tribe\u0026rsquos cultural resources department.The bone handle of a canoe carving adze(Gillian Flaccus/AP)The tribe never made a formal request to have the objects repatriated and instead chose to work with the London institution.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.  Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

The first of the sculptures has been placed across from the Church Street roundabout and is made up of six pieces paying tribute to the historic Waggonway.  Carved into the blocks are images of people carrying coal to the wagons, which were led by horses and took the fuel from the pit at Tranent to Cockenzie Harbour.  The second sculpture has been placed at the rear of Caponhall Court.  It has been designed to celebrate the industry which built the town, with a farmer and coal miner both carved out of stone.  Standing two metres high, the coal miner is depicted at the bottom, with the farmer gathering his crop above it.  On the side of the sculpture on the Elphinstone side of the road is carved the word \u0026lsquoTranent\u0026rsquo.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The cast presents the Broadway smash hit musical comedy, which won six Tony Awards including best musical, at The Brunton in Musselburgh from this evening.  The story follows the adventures of small town girl Millie Dillmount as she arrives in New York with a modern plan \u0026ndash to marry for money, not for love.  Full of fun, mishaps and lively dance routines, the Roaring Twenties will be brought to life on stage over the next four evenings with a run of performances.  East Lothian group Encore was formed in 1993 after parents saw how much fun their children were having with local group Musical Youth and they wanted to join in. Musical Youth was set up in 1992 by Peter and Heather Antonelli to provide an outlet for the talent of local children. They are formerly from Prestonpans but now live in Gullane.  Playing the part of Millie is Alison Henry, from Prestonpans, who was in the first show with Musical Youth 25 years ago. Her mum Anne Henry, a founder member of Encore, takes on the role of the stern office manager Miss Flannery. Hazel Gray, Heather\u0026rsquos sister, is playing the sinister Mrs Meers.  A trio of former Musical Youth members \u0026ndash Kirsty Sandilands, Megan Rourke and Rebecca Kinross \u0026ndash are the Priscilla Girls in the production. The leading man Kevin Macconnachie, playing young paper clip salesman Jimmy Smith, Millie\u0026rsquos love interest, is from Musselburgh.

The latest success for 20-year-old Rebecca Traynor was coming top in the recent final of Linlithgow\u0026rsquos Got Talent.  The soprano was also among the finalists for a competition on Forth 1 to find a singer to perform a contemporary pop song on the station\u0026rsquos breakfast show.  She made it through an initial round that saw her sing on the show and, on Monday, she joined other contestants at Forth House for auditions.  However, the former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil was not chosen as the overall winner.  Rebecca\u0026rsquos singing talent was first spotted by her class teacher when she was a pupil at Pinkie St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School. She won the school\u0026rsquos talent competition at the age of 10, performing Hallelujah.  Her teacher phoned her dad to say she thought Rebecca had a good voice and might benefit from lessons. This was duly done and she developed her skills with advice on breathing and holding notes from a coach.  She completed exams held by Trinity College London \u0026ndash the international exam board for the performing arts and English language.  Rebecca, from Edenhall, is also a former winner of the Musselburgh Rotary Club Young Musician of the Year competition. A double winner of Wishaw\u0026rsquos Got Talent, she also scooped top spot in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Got Talent in 2014.  \u0026ldquoI love singing, she told the Courier.

The 16 objects will go on display on a small Oregon reservation after a decades-long campaign by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde to bring them back from Europe.  The intricate bowls, woven baskets and other pieces were collected by the Rev Robert W Summers, an Episcopal minister who bought them from tribal members in the 1870s and sold them to a colleague.  The colleague later gifted the objects to the British institution.  The Rise of the Collectors exhibit, on display at the Chachalu Tribal Museum and Cultural Centre in Grand Ronde, also includes basketry collected by Dr Andrew Kershaw, who worked on the reservation in the 1890s as a doctor and agent for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Together, the two collections are part of a larger plan by the Grand Ronde to reclaim and examine its history for future generations \u0026mdash a mission that echoes efforts by other tribes around the United States.  Two years ago, a Parisian auction house withdrew a ceremonial shield from an auction after the Acoma Pueblo, a tribe in rural New Mexico, moved to halt its sale.  And tribes from Alaska to Connecticut have used a US law passed in 1990 to reclaim Native American remains and sacred or funerary objects.  The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde wanted the objects back permanently, but worked out an initial year-long loan because a full return of items from the British Museum requires parliamentary action, said David Harrelson, manager of the tribe\u0026rsquos cultural resources department.  The tribe never made a formal request to have the objects repatriated and instead chose to work with the London institution.  The temporary exhibit is regarded as a first step to more collaboration between the Grand Ronde and the British Museum.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a real privilege to be a part of this, where this material heritage is coming back to this community, said Amber Lincoln, curator of the Americas section of the British Museum.  She and a colleague travelled to Oregon with the objects.  \u0026ldquoThis is what we work for, to bring people together \u0026hellip so that we all learn."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7384587.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.  Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.

There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee.

But Ash Pryce received an altogether different legacy - one which sparked a love of the supernatural and things that go bump in the night.  The magician will take to a Glasgow stage later this month with a show inspired by the tales of his Spiritualist grandfather Tom Lund, who introduced Ash to the occult when he was 11.  Spiritualism, which began as a movement in the 19th century, centres around a belief\u0026nbsp in the ability to communicate with the world of the spirits and receive messages from the afterlife.  And while Mr Pryce is not an active believer these days after his work on stage gave him a glimpse \u0027behind the curtain\u0027, his grandfather\u0027s tales of spooks, ghosts and missives from the world beyond have stayed with him to this day.    The illusionist\u0027s grandfather Tom Lund  Mr Pryce said: \"The show is very much a tribute to my grandfather. His room would be full of books on spirits, on ghosts, and we\u0026rsquod chat for hours about the\u0026nbsp other side. It was something that connected us.  \"When he died in 2014 I\u0026nbsp wanted to be able to pay tribute to him, and decided to draw on our\u0026nbsp mutual interest in Spiritualism.  \"I can honestly say that I wouldn\u0027t be a magician today if it wasn\u0027t for him.\"  Mr Pryce said that going to a spiritualist meeting with his grandfather at an early age made a huge impression on him, as the medium began to channel messages from a long-departed relative.  He said: \u0026ldquoI was in awe at what happened\u0026nbsp there.\u0026nbsp A table began bouncing around the room, the medium contacted my deceased great-grandmother\u0026hellip at least, that\u0026rsquos what it seemed.  \"My grandfather believed in it all and it gave me a life-long interest in the paranormal.\"  He later learned that the table was moved by people giving it tiny, reflexive nudges as they stood alongside - similar to the way a Ouija board works - while knocking sounds said to be spirits communicating were actually the sound of the mediums clicking their joints.  However, despite learning the tricks of the trade, he still remains fascinated in the supernatural.    Appearing at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Britannia Panopticon Music Hall - itself said to be haunted\u0026nbsp - the show will see the illusionist resurrect a 160-year-old illusion known as the Spirit Cabinet during a story-led performance based on his experiences with his grandfather.  The Spirit Cabinet was invented by American mediums the Davenport Brothers in the 1850s, and used a prop by mediums during their seances.  It sees a medium\u0026nbsp - in this case the actress Misha McCullagh - secured and bound inside a wooden or curtained box along with several small items, such as bells, writing tablets and occult symbols.  The medium would then challenge the spirits to \u0027cross the veil\u0027 into the material world and they would begin to move and interact with the items, writing messages for the audience to read or floating through the air.

It will be staged first at the Banshee Labyrinth in Edinburgh, part of the underground vaults that make up a large swath of the Old Town, before being brought to Glasgow on Saturday June 23rd.  Mr Pryce said: \u0026ldquoI think magic has the power to be very personal we\u0026rsquore seeing a lot of magic acts \u0026ndash especially on certain television talent shows \u0026ndash drawing on personal stories now, rather than just \u0026lsquopick a card, any card\u0026rsquo and those personal stories are what I think magic needs.

In a move to have\u0026nbspless sugar and more fruit and vegetables on school dinner menus, recommendations by experts to make school food and drink healthier are being consulted on by the Scottish Government.  Although strict rules already apply to the nutritional content of meals, drinks and snacks served in Scottish schools, following a review by health, nutrition and education experts, views are being sought on proposals to further reduce sugar and other measures to promote healthy choices and help tackle childhood obesity.  A list of proposals includes \"no\u0026nbsplonger permitting fruit juice and smoothies to be offered in primary and secondary schools\".    Another proposal involves\u0026nbspintroducing lower sugar limits, for foods such as breakfast cereal and yoghurts.  Ministers also want to reduce how often sweetened and baked goods are available in primary schools.  And they are also planning a new regulation for red meat which specifies, for the first time, how much of a child\u0026rsquos weekly intake should be high-quality produce and limits the amount of processed meat  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wants to cut child obesity by half by 2030.  Put sugar tax on smoothies, say doctors  Almost 30 percent of children in Scotland are at risk of being overweight, and 14 percent are at risk of being obese, according to government figures.  Scotland\u0027s Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"More than 360,000 meals are dished up in Scottish schools every day, setting children and young people up for their lessons and -- through learning about healthy habits -- for life.  \"The proposals we are putting forward are based on the latest scientific and expert advice, as well as the views of local authorities, schools and catering staff.\"  In primary schools uptake of school lunches is the highest it has ever been due to the introduction of free school meals in Scotland in January 20.  Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo health spokesman said the recommenations\u0026nbspwon\u0026rsquot do anything to address pupils leaving at lunchtime to buy junk food.  She also said schools need better kitchen facilities so that fresh food can be prepared and cooked on site.  \u0026ldquoNew guidance on what is served in schools is welcome and providing three portions of fruit and vegetables at lunch time is a start, but when John Swinney began this review he said he wanted primary school children to have as many of their \u0027five a day\u0027 at school as they can,\" she said.  \u0026nbspIt\u0027s disappointing to see this is as far as efforts will go. It also won\u0026rsquot address the fact that in secondary schools most pupils leave at lunchtime, generally to buy junk food from nearby supermarkets, vans and takeaway shops.  \u0026ldquoLondon plans to ban new fast food outlets from opening near schools and we need equally strong action to tackle the obesogenic environment forced upon children and young people in Scotland. Nor is there anything in these proposals to improve facilities for preparing food in schools. Many schools lack kitchens and decent dining halls. We can hardly begin to change the food culture in our schools without investing in the production of healthy, fresh food, on site, and supporting catering staff properly.  \u0026ldquoExpanding the provision of free school meals simply must be a greater priority. It clearly increases uptake and is the best way to make school meals a foundation for healthy eating for all children.  \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Javid expresses  sympathy  to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland","story":"              THE prospects of a student nurse, originally from Africa, staying in Scotland to fulfil his dream of a career in the NHS appear to have risen after Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, said he was \u0026ldquovery sympathetic to his case.  Speaking at his first Commons question-time since taking over his new role, Mr Javid was questioned about the plight of 23-year-old Denzel Darku by the SNP\u0026rsquos Joanna Cherry.  The Edinburgh MP explained how the student nurse, who came to the UK from Ghana aged 14, was a tireless campaigner, who had carried the baton for Scotland in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.  Mr Darku previously served in the Scottish Youth Parliament and currently lives in Paisley. After having two appeals against deportation rejected, he is now battling to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoHe dreams of a career in NHS Scotland but he faces deportation on a technicality through no fault of his own, declared Ms Cherry.  She referred to how the Scottish Government had written to the Secretary of State about Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case but had not yet had a reply and urged him to meet her to discuss it. \u0026ldquoHe only wants to stay in Scotland to serve the NHS, explained the backbencher.  Last week, Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case was raised at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions by Labour MSP Neil Bibby as another example of the UK Government\u0027s controversial \"hostile environment\" immigration policy. Nicola Sturgeon said the student nurse had been \"an absolute credit to Scotland\" and branded the threat of deportation hanging over him a \u0026ldquodisgrace.  The following day, The Herald understands, Ruth Davidson raised the case personally with the Home Secretary in a telephone call.  During Home Office Questions, Mr Javid said he was \u0026ldquopleased that Ms Cherry had raised the issue, noting how he had spoken about it to the Scottish Conservative leader, who, he said, was also \u0026ldquovery concerned.  He told MPs that there was an appeal going on in regards to Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case, so he could not say too much, but then added: \u0026ldquoI am very sympathetic about the situation.  A source close to Ms Davidson said she was \u0026ldquovery pleased by Mr Javid\u0026rsquos comments.  Later, Ms Cherry said the student nurse\u0026rsquos situation was another illustration of the impact of the Government\u0026rsquos immigration policies, which were \u0026ldquodamaging and callous and that Scotland wanted \u0026ldquonothing to do with them.  She went on: \u0026ldquoThis young man is studying hard so he can become a nurse and work in our NHS yet he faces deportation. All this at a time when Theresa May is resisting calls to see sense from even her own Cabinet colleagues and allow skilled migration of health care workers to the UK.  The SNP\u0026rsquos home affairs spokeswoman argued that the Conservative Government was failing the country\u0026rsquos economy and society and that it was \u0026ldquoappalling it had not even had the courtesy to reply to letters from the Scottish Government, which was \u0026ldquochampioning Denzel\u0026rsquos case.  Ms Cherry said a \u0026ldquoScotland-specific migration system would the nation to prioritise what its economy and society needed \u0026ldquorather than having to abide by Tory plans to cut net migration, which we now know will cost our economy \u0026pound10 billion a year  She added: \u0026ldquoAs we move closer to Brexit, we need the UK Government to do more than simply drop their net migration targets we need migration levels to be maintained, if not increased. In Scotland our demographic requirements mean immigration needs to be encouraged.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoWe need powers over migration to come to Scotland we want nothing to do with the Tories\u0026rsquo hostile environment regime.

It might not be Wembley but Broadwood Stadium is a mighty fine start. The accompanying photograph showed the six-piece band on the stage, their arms around each other.  It turns out that this was not only M\u0026agravenran\u0026rsquos first stadium show, it was the stadium\u0026rsquos first show, as well. For one night only, the Cumbernauld venue, home to Clyde FC for the last 28 years, was turned into an outdoor music gig. Broadwood: Live by the Loch, it was called. There were three acts: Dougie MacLean was the opener, followed by M\u0026agravenran and then, shortly after nine o\u0026rsquoclock, after an hour or so of steady rain, the headliners, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers. L\u0026agraven Chomais, a Gaelic rock/traditional band from the local Greenfaulds High School, also played a couple of sets.  By the end of the night - 11pm, or thereabouts - MacLean, M\u0026agravenran and the Pipers had done a mass version of MacLean\u0026rsquos anthem, Caledonia, and the 2,000 fans went home happy. Those who had patiently stood in front of the stage, rather than sitting in the covered stands, had got the worst of the rain, but didn\u0026rsquot seem to mind too much. And within moments the organisers, North Lanarkshire Leisure, were tweeting that the event would return next year, \u0026ldquoeven bigger and better.  Could this be the start of something for Cumbernauld? The aim is that Broadwood will now go on to host further high-profile concerts. It has been tried nearby: Falkirk FC\u0026rsquos stadium has seen concerts by Elton John, Status Quo and Tom Jones, amongst others, while Elton played Airdrie FC\u0026rsquos Excelsior Stadium a year ago this month. As an academic, Dr Stephen Bowman, wrote approvingly on Twitter: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to do down #Cumbernauld but full credit to everyone associated with #LivebytheLoch ... Exactly the sort of the kind of thing the town needs and deserves.  The stadium was effectively divided in two for the show, one half remaining cordoned off while the other half was given over to the staging, lighting and PA system, the standing fans and the food stalls. The leisure centre at one end of Broadwood had become a hospitality centre, with communal changing rooms being turned into dressing-rooms for the musicians.  \u0026ldquoThis all goes back to a Facebook message I got at the back end of January from Gerry McMahon at NL Leisure, said Gary Innes, accordionist with M\u0026agravenran, in a dressing-room strewn with clothes and musical instruments. \u0026ldquoHe said, look, we\u0026rsquove got the Gaelic school out here, and we want to put on a music event but we don\u0026rsquot know who to speak to or what to do, could you come out here for a meeting?  So Innes met them, and they told him that what they wanted to do was to stage a music festival. He drew on his contacts in the industry, assembled a bill, went back to NL Leisure and got it approved. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove got a great team and they have worked their socks off to get the stadium, he said. \u0026ldquoBut when you think about it, the show was signed off only in March, and the turnaround since then has been quite remarkable. A lot of hard work has gone into this.  \u0026ldquoNL Leisure asked if we could give them acts that could sell tickets, bring in the numbers. We knew Dougie was celebrating 40 years of Caledonia and, national treasure that he is, he was an easy fit. The Pipers have a worldwide appeal. Two of them lived in Cumbernauld for many years, so they feel this is kind of a homecoming gig. It\u0026rsquos also part of their 15-year celebration of the band.  \u0026ldquoThe nice thing that NL Leisure is really keen on is building on that local connection with the community and giving them something that they can look forward to and be part of, Innes adds. \u0026ldquoThey acknowledge that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot here [in cultural terms]. In terms of a sports facility it\u0026rsquos brilliant but outwith that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot for the community to do, so if they can add to that each year by putting on a musical event, then it\u0026rsquos great for the community and the stadium. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoThis is a really heavily populated bit of the country, adds his colleague Ewen Henderson, \u0026ldquoand a lot of it are families, and young families, who are quite often cut out of a lot of the cultural spectrum in terms of being able to go to events. Innes added that NL Leisure was already looking forward to next year and trying to get a big headliner in, backed by a solid 10 months of pre-publicity.  Kevin MacDonald is one of the three bagpipers in the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, who fuse trad Scots music with such rock and pop hits as Queen\u0026rsquos We Will Rock You and Snow Patrol\u0026rsquos Chasing Cars (\u0026ldquobagrock, they call it), and who play 200 shows every year. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove known Gary for a number of years and he asked us if we could be on the second of June, he says. \u0026ldquoWe were meant to be in Germany today but the event was cancelled, so it has worked out great for us.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite nice in that both [piper] Willie [Armstrong] and I, the two founding members, both lived in Cumbernauld. I went to Greenfaulds High School and that\u0026rsquos where I met Willie. He still stays here.  \u0026ldquoThe biggest thing on a personal side that I\u0026rsquove noticed about Cumbernauld, because I came from a small community in Aberdeen before coming down here, is that, unfortunately, it suffers from a lack of different communities, because it\u0026rsquos seen as a commuter town between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Even when I was growing up here, if you wanted a night out you went to Glasgow or you went to Edinburgh. Unfortunately it has never built up a proper community-type spirit where people can come along. Clyde have been in the football stadium here some 24, 25 years ago and it\u0026rsquos great to see that NLL is now trying to bring events [like the concert] here.  Rain had been threatening for a couple of hours before the show. The atmosphere is muggy, and the crowd is still in the process of arriving, when L\u0026agraven Chomais open proceedings. Dougie MacLean, who has travelled with his wife Jenny from Perthshire to be here, plays songs old and new, and gets the audience going as he has been doing for years now. He teasingly alludes to, but doesn\u0026rsquot actually name, what is probably his best-known song. That, it seems, is for later.  M\u0026agravenran play an engaging, boisterous set and win a lot of new fans in the process. Gary Innes, who has put the bill together, and who won the Instrumentalist of the Year title at last December\u0026rsquos Scots Trad Music Awards, suffers a mishap, however, for the first time in his professional career: he raises his arms, and his accordion strap breaks. He has to disappear for a few minutes to borrow an accordion from L\u0026agraven Chomais.  The food and drink stalls have been doing solid business throughout the night, and finally it\u0026rsquos the turn of the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, complete with their energetic dancers, Rachel and Eilidh. Amazing Grace is one of their early songs but it\u0026rsquos the rock covers that really get the fans dancing, some of them managing to dance as they clutch umbrellas and pints of beer. And at some point during the set, Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell \u0026amp Wishaw, who is present, spots a \u0026ldquovery young lady in the act of flossing. \u0026ldquoRespect, she tweets.  Back in the M\u0026agravenran dressing-room, bottles of wine have been opened, and the general opinion is that the night has gone rather well. Kevin Rodgers, a Gaelic teacher at Greenfaulds had earlier spoken of his delight at how L\u0026agraven Chomais\u0026rsquos sets have gone. The teenagers - Craig Yule, Ava MacKinnon, Jessica Muir and Emily Robertson (a fifth, Eilidh Millar, was unable to make it) - were, he said, \u0026ldquoall as high as kites, absolutely. It\u0026rsquos been a brilliant experience, ever since they came here for a soundcheck at four o\u0026rsquoclock.  Outside again: darkness has fallen, and the kilted Pipers are bringing their set to a close. It\u0026rsquos been a good one: you can see why they\u0026rsquove played sell-out tours across the world, and why their fans include Ewan McGregor, Sir Paul McCartney, the Scottish rugby team, the Queen and Samuel L Jackson, to quote from the band\u0026rsquos website. And then, as a final act, all the musicians crowd onto the stage to sing Caledonia, the audience lustily singing along.  Graeme Morrison, operations and business development manager at NL Leisure, and one of the event organisers, said the concert had been delivered over a relatively short timescale, compared to the time it would normally take to organise and promoting an event of this size. \u0026ldquoWhile the day itself was very long, it was incredibly rewarding and exhilarating to see so many people enjoying the show. We\u0026rsquore already talking about next year. We feel we\u0026rsquore in a privileged position to be able to put something like this on for the community. Because everybody praised it so much, despite the bad weather, we owe the audience and the community this, to put it on again next year. We\u0026rsquore open to working in partnership with big promoters, but what we\u0026rsquove absolutely demonstrated with Saturday is we\u0026rsquore capable of putting on our own events.  \u0026ldquoThis is a legacy event for us, he added. \u0026ldquoI want people to be talking about Broadwood: Live by the Loch in twenty years\u0026rsquo time."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s diary  Driven demented  In the soup  Took a pounding","story":"              Driven demented  A SOUTH side reader who returned from a shopping trip to Silverburn tells us: \"I didn\u0027t know who to feel more sorry for - myself for not being able to remember where I parked my car, or the driver slowly following me through the car park hoping to get my space.\"  In the soup  GOOD news!

Here is a look at the key announcements.  \u0026ndash iOS 12  Apple said a key component of iOS 12, which powers the iPhone and iPad, was to improve the performance of the software across its devices.  The tech giant said updates mean the new operating system will run up to 40% on all devices, including older ones compatible for the update.  New augmented reality tools are also a part of iOS 12, with the company having created a new file format known as USDC, which will enable users to send images and objects that can be viewed in AR between different devices and to other users.  A new AR measurement app, called Measure, has been created too \u0026ndash effectively giving users a digital ruler on their device that can measure items seen through the camera.

The Tories have been under pressure since the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an investigation, highlighting a range of claims including candidates and other representatives allegedly having far-right connections or sending offensive tweets.  The Labour leader backed calls for an investigation on Monday night after Home Secretary Sajid Javid rejected the proposition of an inquiry, which gained support from Conservative Peer Baroness Warsi.  \u0026ldquoI think if there are allegations made then an inquiry should be held and it should be addressed and it should be dealt with, Mr Corbyn told the Press Association at a west London mosque.  \u0026ldquoIslamophobia, as with anti-Semitism, as with any other form of racism, has no place whatsoever in our society or in any of our political parties. Nobody should be condoning it, nobody should be hiding it, everybody should be exposing it.          We are calling for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party following more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia in the party last month pic.twitter/ymkFRDs5sF          \u0026mdash MCB (@MuslimCouncil) May 30, 2018  He highlighted reported rises of Islamophobic hate crimes, and added: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos dedicate ourselves, during Ramadan, to say we will drive out Islamophobia from our society.  Mr Corbyn was speaking at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in Westbourne Park after an evening meal for Muslims to end their daily Ramadan fast.  The opposition leader has himself come under pressure over allegations of anti-Semitism in his own party, leading Prime Minister Theresa May to accuse him of allowing it to \u0026ldquorun rife.  The MCB\u0026rsquos general secretary Harun Khan last week wrote to the Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, saying there had been \u0026ldquomore than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia by Tory figures in April.  Mr Khan also highlighted Zac Goldsmith\u0026rsquos unsuccessful bid against Labour\u0026rsquos Sadiq Khan to become Mayor of London in 2016, claiming there had been no action against those responsible for \u0026ldquoshocking Islamophobia during the campaign.  Rejecting the calls, Mr Javid told the Andrew Marr Show the MCB did not represents Muslims in the UK.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would be very suspicious of anything that they\u0026rsquove got to say, not least because under the last Labour government and a policy continued by us, we don\u0026rsquot deal with the MCB and we don\u0026rsquot deal with it because too many of their members have had, you know, comments on extremists and that\u0026rsquos not acceptable."},{"url":null,"title":"From first 999 call to stay-put advice  key points from Grenfell inquiry","story":"              Thousands of pages of expert reports and a comprehensive opening statement from the Grenfell Tower inquiry\u0026rsquos top lawyer have shed fresh light on the fire last June.  Here, the Press Association looks at the major details which emerged about the tragedy on Monday.  Cause of the fire  Two experts agree that the origins of the fire were undetermined. It was previously suggested by the politan Police that a fridge-freezer in the fourth floor flat was to blame, but Professor Luke Bisby said there was \u0026ldquoinsufficient evidence to support this.  The first 999 calll  On Monday, the inquiry was played audio from the initial emergency call made on the night of the fire.  Behailu Kebede, in whose flat the blaze had begun, rang 999 at 12.54am.  He told the operator: \u0026ldquoQuick, quick, quick. It\u0026rsquos burning.  The spread of the fire  It is believed that absence of fire-proof stops around the frame of Mr Kebede\u0026rsquos window allowed the flames to eat through and reach the flammable material behind.  Once there, it shot up the side of the building in a matter of minutes. It is believed that the Reynobond cladding panels were the main fuelant of the blaze, rather than the insulation.  The fire stops between each floor had not been correctly installed, meaning there was nothing preventing the fire jumping between levels.  Fire testing  Dr Barbara Lane said she found \u0026ldquono evidence that major bodies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower knew how the rainscreen cladding materials would perform in a fire.  This included a risk assessment of the building carried out by the London Fire Brigade and Tenant Management Organisation, which did not mention the behaviour of the cladding in a fire.  Safety measures  Fire safety measures within the building were largely non-compliant with regulations, one report said.  This included faulty fire doors, ineffective fire lifts and a inadequate ventilation system. This had terrible consequences, as the only escape route in the building \u0026ndash the stairwell \u0026ndash became clogged with smoke and was then ravaged by fire.  Dr Lane said a \u0026ldquoculture of non-compliance appeared to exist in the maintenance of the tower.  The unforgiving conditions on the night meant that firefighters could not reach the upper levels of the building, as they could not create a bridge above floor four. It is believed none made it above floor 20 until late afternoon.  \u0026ldquoThe ultimate consequence was a disproportionately high loss of life, \u0026nbspdue to firefighters not being to breathe for long enough to carry out prolonged rescue efforts, the report said.  Stairwells  It is believed that one reason the stairwell became so impassable was due to doors being left open by firefighters\u0026rsquo hoses and, in one case, a dead body.  This allowed smoke to shroud the escape route and ultimately let the flames in.  Stay put advice  The advice that the residents stay put in the event of a fire was futile within half an hour of it starting, at 1.26am, Dr Lane claimed.  There was concern expressed in her report that it took so long between the point at which smoke entered the stairwell \u0026ndash 1.40am \u0026ndash and the plan eventually being abandoned at 2.47am.  This was particularly the case after a major incident was declared just after 2am, she said.  Victims  The reports mapped out where bodies were recovered from the tower.  Three people jumped from windows and were found outside. Most of the other casualties were discovered in their own flats, but 29 had travelled to other parts of the tower.  Nineteen victims were able to reach the exit stair, but proceeded upwards rather than downwards, Jose Torero\u0026rsquos report said.  Three victims were found either in the stairs or in the adjacent lobby, \u0026ldquosuggesting they attempted to travel down the egress stair."},{"url":null,"title":"Woody Allen  I should be poster face for  MeToo movement","story":"              Woody Allen has said he should be the face of the #MeToo movement in terms of what to do right.  He spoke during an interview with Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata that was broadcast on Sunday night.  Allen said he is a \u0026ldquobig advocate of #MeToo and that he should be the poster face for the movement because he has worked with hundreds of actresses over 50 years, and they have never \u0026ldquosuggested any impropriety.  He told Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata in New York: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos funny, I should be the poster boy for the #Metoo movement because I\u0026rsquove worked in movies for 50 years, I\u0026rsquove worked with hundreds of actresses\u0026hellip and not a single one, big ones, famous ones, have ever, ever, suggested any kind of impropriety at all.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom in principle, and in spirit, completely in favour of their bringing to justice genuine harassers, Allen said during the interview with Argentina\u0026rsquos Channel 13.  \u0026ldquoNow, if innocent ones get swept up in there, that\u0026rsquos very sad for the person, it\u0026rsquos unjust, but otherwise, I think it\u0026rsquos a very good thing to expose harassment.  In 2014 Dylan Farrow, Allen\u0026rsquos daughter, renewed the claim that Allen molested her in 1992 when she was seven.  Allen has long denied the allegations. He was investigated but not charged.  A number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen, raising questions about the future of the prolific filmmaker in a Hollywood newly sensitive to allegations of sexual misconduct.  Earlier this year, Mira Sorvino published a public apology to Farrow, saying she was sorry for \u0026ldquoturning a blind eye to Farrow\u0026rsquos accusations against Allen. She also vowed never to work with him again. Sorvino starred in Allen\u0026rsquos Mighty Aphrodite.  \u0026ldquoWhat bothers me is that I get linked in with them, Allen said.  \u0026ldquoPeople who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse, and abuse, and abuse, and I, who was only accused by one woman, in a child custody case, which was looked at, and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people."},{"url":null,"title":"World-leading upgrades at Scotland   s key heritage sites","story":"              They were once Scotland\u0026rsquos long forgotten landmarks, with their stories of heritage and tradition confined to the history books.  But thanks to the work of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), many of the country\u0026rsquos key sites are being given a new lease of life.  NTS this week announced an ambitious five-year plan, detailing a \u0026pound60 million commitment to Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage.  The charity hopes the investment will not only attract more visitors to its sites, but also encourage more Scots to become members of the trust.  NTS chief executive Simon Skinner said: \u0026ldquoThis strategy outlines everything that the National Trust for Scotland stands for - protecting our heritage, sharing unique experiences with people and promoting Scotland, all through the collective endeavour of our supporters and staff.  He added that as part of the strategy, the key message to Scots is: \u0026ldquoWe need your help if we\u0026rsquore going to keep doing the things that you like and looking after the things that you love.  One of the biggest projects included in the plan is the conservation of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos Hill House in Helensburgh.  The crumbling landmark was built as a \u0026ldquohome for the future in 1902 but the experimental building material has allowed water to soak into the building.  The trust is spending \u0026pound5m on the world-leading project, which will begin later this year.  \u0026ldquoThis is a pure conservation exercise, said Mr Skinner. \u0026ldquoThe cage will keep the rain out but allow the wind to blow through and hopefully dry the building out.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore essentially buying time until we can come up with a solution for the building.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time anything like this has been done anywhere in the world. Other countries are looking to Scotland to see if this works, so it\u0026rsquos very significant conservation project.  The cage will also include gangways allowing the public to view the building and the ongoing restoration work.  Elsewhere in Scotland, Glencoe is also set to benefit from \u0026pound1.1m of investment.  This will include an upgrade to access roads and the site\u0026rsquos visitor centre, which Mr Skinner describes as a \u0026ldquolost opportunity.  He said: \u0026ldquoMany people don\u0026rsquot realise that the landscape you see wouldn\u0026rsquot quite be the same if you didn\u0026rsquot have us looking after it.  \u0026ldquoWe maintain the access roads and look after the visitor centre and all that comes at a cost.  \u0026ldquoMany people simply pass by the visitor centre and that\u0026rsquos a lost opportunity to engage around one million people each year.  Just a little further along the road, another important site - the Glenfinnan Monument - is also in need of some attention.  The monument, at the head of Loch Shiel, pays tribute to Bonnie Prince Charlie and those who fought in the Jacobite Risings.  Built in 1815, the 18m-high building is now overshadowed by a more modern tourist attraction - the Glenfinnan viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter film franchise.  The site\u0026rsquos visitor centre will receive a \u0026pound250,000 upgrade in a bid, as Mr Skinner says, to \u0026ldquogive the Harry Potter fans a reason to turn around.  Inverewe Garden and Estate in Wester Ross will also receive a \u0026pound700,000 boost under the strategy.  It ha s already received \u0026pound2.5m for a new glasshouse to display rare and exotic plants, and to enable Inverewe House to be open to the public for the first time, and the next stage of investment will involve the creation of an access tower linking the gardens and viewpoint over Loch Ewe.  The House of Dun, in Montrose, will also receive a \u0026pound800,000 upgrade, while other sites to benefit also include the Burns Monument in Ayrshire and Alexander \u0026ldquoGreek Thomson\u0026rsquos unique interiors at Holmwood in Cathcart.  The number of visitors to NTS properties began a long decline in the 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005/06 visitor numbers sat at 1.45m, but by 2014/15 had dropped by 24 per cent to 1.1m.  However, the situation has began to improve over the last three years, with the latest figures showing total visitors numbers sitting at 3.69m for 2017/18.  The trust hopes that its new strategy will allow it to further build on that and encourage more people to experience the best of Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage."}]
