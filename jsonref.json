They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Archbishop Canterbury Justin Welby says God acted safety net","story":"Share this article ‘She had a breakdown and very severe depression, and still suffers from illness, and she’s married now with two children.‘She wrote a beautiful book called I Thought There Would Be Cake.

Photograph: Alan BetsonFrom today, parents and s of children aged five to 11 years can book online for their child to be vaccinated against Covid-19, the HSE has said. The new online booking system, which opens on Sunday, will allow parents and s to arrange for their child to be vaccinated at a “time that suits them” including during the midterm break, Dr Lucy Jessop, director of public health at the national immunisation office said. Children in this age group will be vaccinated in separate clinics to those aged 12 or over. This younger age group will also receive a different Covid-19 vaccine dose to the one given to older children and adults, said a HSE statement. Even if the child turns 12 between their first and second dose, they must still get the dosage given to younger children, it added. Children must attend their appointment with a parent or  and will not be vaccinated if they arrive alone, said the HSE. They must also wait 21 days after their first dose before booking for the second jab. Appointments for children aged 5-15 years must also be booked by a parent or legal  who will give their consent for the child to be vaccinated. If the child recently had Covid-19, they must wait at least four weeks before getting their first or second dose of the vaccine. Dr Jessop urged parents to ensure any information they consume on the vaccination comes from a “trusted source” such as the HSE or a medical professional. Chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Council Prof Karina Butler has encouraged parents and s to get their younger children vaccinated but acknowledged that many would have genuine concerns and questions about its safety. “However, when the available evidence relating to the risk Covid-19 can pose to some children, as well as the significant negative impact on the lives of all of them, particularly the educational and social lives of our children, are considered, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks,” she said last month. About one in every 2,250 child under 18 who has so far received a Covid-19 vaccine has reported a suspected side-effect, according to the Health Products Regulatory Authority’s latest safety update. Overall, the authority says, the reports received are consistent with the types of reports received for adults, with most being mild to moderate in nature. Many had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting, it said.The most commonly reported side-effect among children (325 reports) was “general symptoms and local reactions” such as tiredness, weakness, chest pain and feeling hot.Ireland has one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the world. More than 10 million jabs have been given since December 2020. Some 95 per cent of all adults have had two vaccine doses and Ireland has close to the highest rates of booster vaccinations in the European Union. However, vaccine take-up among children aged between five and 11 has been slower than it was in the adult population. Just 22 per cent of this age group had received a first dose by February 12th and only 9 per cent have been fully vaccinated.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm eunice almost 1 000 properties set for second night without power","story":"Localised flooding due to Storm Eunice at Rathfarnham, Dublin.

It is expected just under 1,000 homes and businessess will not have their power restored until lunchtime on Sunday.The spokesman urged people to keep an eye on powercheck.ie for updates on the status of power outages in their area and said crew would be back working from “first light” to restore power to those still affected.“Due to the severity of the damage to the electricity network in the Southwest region, some customers in South Kerry and West Cork will again be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes.”Tributes have been paid to Wexford County Council employee Billy Kinsella (59), who was killed on Friday while clearing fallen debris caused by the strong winds.Mr Kinsella died in Ballythomas when a gust of wind toppled a tree near to one he had been working to remove.In a statement, Wexford County Council said: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the employee’s family, work colleagues and friends at this very difficult time.”Local Fianna Fáil councillor Pip Breen said the county had been hit by unusual and severe northerly winds which had felled numerous trees. “When something like this happens, it puts everything into perspective,” he said.“A man out helping his community and he gets killed in the line of work. It’s after coming as a ferocious shock to the council.”The storm has claimed the lives of at least eight other people across Europe since it struck the west coast of Ireland in the early hours of Friday.Three people were killed across Britain where the storm brought record winds of up to 196kmh and caused widespread destruction. Another five deaths were recorded during the storm in Belgium and the Netherlands.Meanwhile, customers scheduled to travel by ferry to the UK, France and Spain from Rosslare and Dublin Port continued to face cancellations and delays on Saturday because of the bad weather. A number of Stena Line customers took to Twitter seeking advice after discovering their Saturday evening and Sunday sailings had been cancelled.A total of 43 flights in and out of Dublin Airport were cancelled on Friday. However, flights appeared to have returned to normal by Saturday, with all evening departures leaving on time and just one cancellation on a flight arriving from Ausria.CancellationsTwo League of Ireland fixtures – in Longford and Sligo – were postponed on Saturday due to the poor weather conditions, according to the FAI.Many trees came down during the storm, the emergency co-ordination group said, blocking some national and regional roads. Damage from the storm in the State was most extensive in west Cork and Kerry, with some of the worst affected areas including Kilgarvan, Cahersiveen, Milltown, Bandon, Bantry, Ballydehob and Dunmanway.At about 8.15am on Friday a large tree fell on a family home in Cobh, Co Cork, with branches smashing through downstairs windows and jutting into the upstairs landing through the roof, attic and ceiling. Electrical and telephone wires lay severed and loose on the ground from the impact.‘Next thing: Bang!’The owners Jacqui and Kevin O’Regan, were getting ready to go to their home offices, both at the front of the house, when the tree came crashing in.“I was just finished saying ‘actually it isn’t too bad this morning’, and we thought the storm should be easing off, and next thing: Bang!” said Mrs O’Regan.“I have to say I got an awful fright, I was definitely in a state of shock. I was standing there for ages trying to figure out what I was feeling. Do you know what it was? It’s that you realise how vulnerable you are to the elements. You think that because you’re in a house, you’re safe,” she told The Irish Examiner.There were also multiple crashes on the Glenshane Pass in Co Derry – the main Derry to Belfast road – due to snow and ice, though nobody was injured.Met Éireann has also issued a status yellow rain warning for Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo until 4pm on Sunday.Milder conditions, scattered showers and bright spells will follow from the southwest and strong westerly winds will develop. The rain will return from the west on Saturday evening with widespread outbreaks during the night and a possibility of localised flooding in the west and the north. It will also be very windy on Saturday night, especially on Atlantic coasts.The wet and windy weather will continue on Sunday with possible hail in the afternoon.

Photograph: Peter ParksAFP via Getty ImagesThe scenes were straight out of China’s coronavirus playbook. Armies of workers, deployed to lock down residents. Plans to erect a massive makeshift hospital. And on Wednesday, a command from Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader, plastered across local front pages: “Make controlling the epidemic as soon as possible an overwhelming priority.”The site of the latest outbreak, though, was not mainland China, but neighbouring Hong Kong. And unlike on the mainland, where the government’s lofty language has been followed by quick results, no such relief is in sight.As Hong Kong sinks under its worst wave yet of coronavirus, overwhelmed hospitals have left patients waiting on pavements. People have stood in testing lines that wind across parks and soccer fields. Cases are still growing exponentially, as officials opt for targeted lockdowns rather than a citywide one.Researchers have warned that by summer the latest wave could kill nearly 1,000 people – more than four times the number that have died of Covid in Hong Kong over the past two years.The city’s flailing response has exposed a crucial weakness in its ability to handle coronavirus. Unlike other places facing a surge of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, cannot choose to live with the virus Beijing continues to demand local elimination. But the city, which retains certain freedoms unheard-of in the mainland, also cannot wield Beijing’s full authoritarian tool kit or nearly unlimited manpower to stamp out transmission at any cost.‘Dynamic zero’Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has struggled even to define the term that the government uses to describe its approach, “dynamic zero”. “‘Dynamic zero’ – I admit this is a policy requirement of the mainland,” she told reporters last month. “But I am not the initiator, so if you want an authoritative definition of ‘dynamic’, I’m sorry, I really can’t explain it.”At its core, the city’s crisis reflects the limitations of its unique political model. Health experts have pointed out that certain measures, such as citywide mandatory testing, would be impractical in Hong Kong, and could also stir anger in a public already deeply distrustful of the government.But as Beijing exerts ever-tighter control over Hong Kong, through a national security law and sweeping crackdown on dissent, those considerations may start to carry less weight.Some have called Hong Kong’s willingness to embrace tougher restrictions a proxy for its loyalty to Beijing. “The loopholes and oscillation in Hong Kong’s antivirus strategy show that some officials have not met the requirements for ‘firm patriotism’, said Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing’s Beihang University who studies Hong Kong.Last month, the Hong Kong government was forced to clarify that it was legal to make “general remarks and discussion” about the effectiveness of dynamic zero, after Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, suggested that questioning it could violate the security law.Meanwhile, the public health toll continues to grow. Some 12,000 people who have tested positive are still waiting to be admitted to a hospital or isolation unit, according to government figures. After five months with no Covid deaths, Hong Kong has recorded at least 21 over the past week, including a 3-year-old girl and a 100-year-old woman on Tuesday.Early successesUntil this wave, Hong Kong kept coronavirus largely in check. The city’s combination of tight social distancing rules and aggressive contact tracing meant that the previous four waves of infection were curbed relatively quickly. For much of 2021, the city recorded no local cases. But the highly transmissible Omicron variant assaulted the cracks in the city’s defences.The first local Omicron transmissions were traced to two flight attendants who returned from abroad in December. A bigger Omicron cluster was connected to a woman who was infected while in hotel quarantine after returning from Pakistan. The woman passed the virus to her husband, who spread it to a cleaner at a vast housing development.Hong Kong locked down a half-dozen buildings and tested 37,000 people last month after more than 100 people there tested positive. The virus has now spread to more than 20 senior homes and care facilities, highlighting another weakness in Hong Kong’s preparations. While more than 84 per cent of people over age 11 have had at least one shot of a vaccine, among those 70 and older, the proportion is just 56 per cent.“In a way we were a victim of our own success because the fatality rate and the infection rate were pretty good until recently,” said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who was speaking by phone from self-quarantine after her driver tested positive. “Older people thought they didn’t need to be vaccinated because there could be complications. And the government was hesitant. We have avoided vaccine mandates.”As the outbreak grew, Lam at first tried to draw a clear line between Hong Kong and the mainland, even as she pledged to adhere to dynamic zero. It would be impractical to invite mainland workers to carry out door-to-door testing, she said this month, in part because of language differences the primary language in Hong Kong is Cantonese, not the Mandarin used in the mainland. Lam also rejected calls from pro-Beijing lawmakers to introduce mandatory universal testing, defending the more targeted operations.“If we give up this effective, focused testing work and rashly follow other places to conduct so-called community testing, I will not bear the consequences,” she said. “Anti-epidemic work is not a slogan.”“The Hong Kong government just follows instructions from Beijing, but they are still hesitant to go full throttle, to go all the way,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They know that most people in Hong Kong don’t trust the Chinese way of doing things.”Political pressureBut in recent weeks, as the outbreak has spiralled out of control, calls for Hong Kong to draw closer to the mainland strategy have grown. China’s state news agency and official Communist Party mouthpiece both published commentaries this month warning against any suggestion of living with the virus.The political pressure, coupled with the deteriorating public health situation, seems to have had an effect. Over the weekend, Hong Kong officials travelled to Shenzhen, across the border, to set up joint task forces with officials there. The task forces will work to increase testing capacity and build makeshift isolation facilities, like the ones used in China, the government said.On Wednesday, Beijing announced that it would also assign central government officials, in addition to the regional ones, to help oversee Hong Kong’s outbreak. But even pro-Beijing figures acknowledge that Hong Kong cannot copy the mainland model outright.When authorities this month locked down Baise, a city of about 3.6 million in southwestern China, after a flare-up of several dozen cases, they deployed 38,000 Communist Party members and workers to patrol neighbourhoods and coordinate supplies, according to the local government. Such networks are a longstanding part of the mainland’s social controls. Hong Kong has more than twice as many residents and no such network.“We lack enough organisation, mobilisation and control capabilities, and we also lack a strong government,” said Lau Siu-Kai, an adviser to Beijing in Hong Kong.Hong Kongers could also prove fiercely resistant to a citywide lockdown. When Lam visited a locked-down housing estate last month, residents showered her with insults from their windows – a display of public dissent rarely seen since the imposition of the security law.The government has hesitated to introduce more invasive contact tracing apps such as exist in the mainland, in part because of residents’ privacy concerns. But some worry that authorities will use the latest outbreak as an opportunity to push through more surveillance measures, Willy Lam, the professor, said. Trust in the Hong Kong and Beijing governments “is quite low”, he said.Health experts say the political debate has overshadowed the grim medical reality. Between low vaccination rates among older people and the slowness to impose lockdowns, the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, no matter what path Hong Kong adopts, said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“Hong Kong is moving too late,” he said. “We don’t have any good options.” – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesEverything you need to

could be blocked under plans being considered by the Government to give councils powers to impose quotas on the number of gambling outlets.The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) and Local Government Association (LGA) have proposed that councils should be able to refuse applications for new outlets if they judge that there are already too many in an area.At present, councils have no powers to prevent bingo halls, arcades or betting shops setting up – even if there is already judged to be an oversupply and a risk of increasing gambling addiction.They want a new “public health” power to prevent the proliferation of any single type of gambling premises in an area, with ministers weighing up the plans as part of the Government’s white paper on gambling, due in the next month.It is expected to include a ban on sports shirt sponsorships by gambling firms – backed by the APCC and LGA – a £2 cap on stakes on online slot games and “affordability” tests for punters.There are around 400,000 gambling addicts in the UK, including 55,000 children, while more than two million people are at risk.They warned that limits on “crack cocaine” fixed odds betting terminals to four machines per shop had backfired by encouraging more to open, creating clusters, and the use of bingo halls as locations for the machines.It came as the NHS announced that it would stop taking cash from the gambling industry for the treatment of people suffering addiction.Claire Murdoch, the NHS England national mental health director, has written to the grant-making charity GambleAware to say the NHS will be fully funding its own gambling services from April 1.On Saturday, health chiefs announced the launch of two new gambling clinics in Southampton and Stoke-on-Trent, taking the number of specialist clinics across England to seven.Ms Murdoch said the funding decision had been “heavily influenced” by patients who were uncomfortable about using services paid for by the industry – a view that has been echoed by doctors.GambleAware accounts show that it collected £16 million in voluntary donations from the gambling industry to fund a range of treatment services between April and December last year. These include NHS gambling clinics, which received £1.2 million in 202021.The overall voluntary pledges to GambleAware last year included £1 million from William Hill, just over £4 million from Bet365 and £4 million from Entain.In April last year, Ms Murdoch told  that gambling firms had profited during the pandemic but were leaving the NHS to “pick up the pieces” of addiction and should be hit with a compulsory levy to fund treatment.In her new letter to GambleAware, she said that while industry funding “has allowed us to roll out treatment services faster than would have otherwise been possible”, there was a desire to “move the funding into general NHS funding, as is standard for other similar services”.More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionWe’re taking action to keep Britain safe from Russia’s malicious activitiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"comes cancel culture safer national trust authenticity key","story":"Despite the February cold, we are sitting on picnic chairs on the edge of an Oxfordshire field Kate Mavor, brought up in Glasgow, now chief executive of English Heritage, doesn’t react to the chill. In fact, she’s smiling.This is doubly remarkable because the organisation she heads has just received its final tranche of government money. “That’s it – finito,” she says. Fortunately, due to successful fundraising and a membership that has zoomed to a million, English Heritage – custodian of hundreds of historic monuments, buildings and places – appears to be in good shape. What’s more, it has come out of the pandemic seeming stronger than it went in.Part of the reason for that lies around us. Despite the wintry birdsong and the occasional roar of a train at full tilt on the nearby railway line, this is no ordinary field in it are the remains of North Leigh Roman Villa. Beside knee-high stumps of wall is a large mosaic, excavated in 1816, now covered by a corrugated iron roof – there were originally 16 mosaics here, but the rest disappeared as souvenir hunters removed tesserae in the 19th century.Inside, a curator is undertaking a spot of “tile-slapping”: this, she tells me, is the technical term for carefully sponging off the hydroponic dust that will build up, even in a rural location. This must be done twice a year or the dust will bond with the surface of the mosaic and make it dull. Joining her are local volunteers, happy to brave the cold to help preserve and display a local monument. Volunteers were never welcomed when English Heritage was government-funded. Now, they are becoming its life’s blood.Much of the credit for this transformation is down to Mavor. A mother with two children, who ides her time between the Welsh borders and London, she has a natural warmth, as well as a single-minded focus on the mission. Most of her week is spent visiting English Heritage properties, such as North Leigh. There are more than 400 of them, from the famous – like the Battlefield of Hastings or the Uffington White Horse – to others that are little more than bumps in the ground. Abbeys, castles, ancient halls, deserted medieval villages, 47 London statues, a Cold War bunker and 60 Roman sites, like North Leigh.Until 2015, the government agency that cared for them – itself called English Heritage, confusingly – also contained what is now Historic England. Still part of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Historic England helps “realise the potential” of England’s historic environment, principally by stopping people from knocking it down through the listed buildings system.English Heritage kept the title of the old agency, but was hived off. Government wanted to shed the responsibility for owning so many heritage properties. The new English Heritage, a charity, was sent on its way with £80 million, which experts predicted to be woefully inadequate in relation to the costs of repairing a portfolio of fragile structures of immense historical significance. It’s the last of this money that has just been handed over. English Heritage must now pay its own way.For seven years, Mavor has been the first and so far only chief executive of the new body. She had previous experience of rescuing cultural institutions from black holes, having come from running the National Trust for Scotland, a financial basket case until she took over in 2009. It helped that, after reading modern languages at Trinity College, Oxford (where, on her first day, she met her husband, the author Andrew Williams), she studied at the London Business School. Her career began as a graduate trainee at Thomson books, and progressed through various roles in publishing. She then set up her own market research company, worked as head of a language interpretation service, and, in 2005, became chief executive of Project Scotland, which encourages young people to work with charities – hence her sympathy for volunteering.For her predecessor at the old English Heritage, the charismatic historian Dr Simon Thurley, the role was nothing but a poisoned chalice: he effectively abolished his own position when the amoeba ided. By contrast, Mavor reckons her job is the best in the world.And she has a lot of fun in store for 2022. Apart from the need to get visitors back to the properties after the pandemic, there’s Hadrian’s Wall – 1,900 years old this year.All of English Heritage’s 60 Roman sites across the land, including North Leigh, will be in celebration mode to mark the event. At the other end of the country from Northumberland and Cumbria, the gigantic triumphal arch that once stood at Richborough in Kent, the port from which the Roman army was resupplied, will be rebuilt out of wood. “It’s huge,” says Mavor. “Bigger than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, I think. We’re recreating it for this summer. We also did an archaeological dig there last autumn, which was incredibly exciting. We have a new museum opening to showcase what was discovered.”Clifford’s Tower in York is being reimagined. Previously, this early mediaeval castle was nothing but a masonry shell on a mound, much-loved by local people and surrounded by daffodils in spring, but rarely visited for more than 10 minutes. “It’s going to be transformed,” declares Mavor. “We’ve done this amazing feat of engineering by lowering into the centre of the cylinder a completely new platform: you’ll be able to see things invisible since the 17th century. And then we can tell the whole story in a more measured, leisurely way.“Up at the top, you get a 360-degree view of York, with the minster at one side and the countryside beyond. The really magical thing is you can see nothing of this from the outside. Externally, Clifford’s Tower looks exactly the same as before.”And yet, in this age of cancel culture, isn’t there a problem here? Clifford’s Tower witnessed some extremely gruesome episodes of history, such as a massacre of York’s Jewish community in 1190. Yes, but English Heritage isn’t tying itself up in knots over its interpretation of the past, unlike the increasingly woke National Trust, which has upset members, MPs and traditionalists by producing, two years ago, a shoddily researched paper into its properties’ links with slavery and colonialism, partly in response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.“We feel on quite safe ground there,” says Mavor, “because we have always relied upon scholarship and research as a starting point – authenticity is one of our core values. It’s always been in our DNA to research things really thoroughly. Black history is something we looked at, and as long ago as 2007 we commissioned research on the transatlantic slave trade links to our sites. We fold all of that into our stories.” There is another contrast to be made with curatorship. While the National Trust (which is “enormous compared to us”, she says) has been downgrading the role of experts over the past couple of years, reducing the number of its curators and specialists, English Heritage employs 11 full-time historians, nine property curators and 15 collections curators, as well as many site staff with history backgrounds. Not that she will be drawn into a rivalry with the trust.“I’m full of love for it,” says Mavor. “I think what they do is amazing, but we both have our distinctive identities. They’ve got different origins as a charity to protect open countryside and coastline, before the country houses came along. English Heritage is really about telling the story of England over six millennia. We go deep into the scholarship.”And she understands the challenges the National Trust faces. “It is a very broad church. They get so much interest because they have to please so many people. Anybody who attracts passionate discourse is basically engaging people, which is all good.”The trust, despite its enviable endowments, was one of the first bodies to call for public money to make good the effects of the pandemic. Successive phases of lockdown meant that revenue-generating properties couldn’t open. Wasn’t English Heritage hit equally hard? It was, and Mavor has been relying on government loans to get through they secured a £23.4 million Culture Recovery loan that they will need to pay back.  But there is another story. Smaller sites like North Leigh proved a godsend for many people during the restrictions. Visitor numbers at English Heritage sites shot up – and not just among those wishing to test their eyesight by visiting places like Barnard Castle. (Who would have thought Dominic Cummings might inspire a mini tourist boom?)“Kirkham Priory, which is one of our absolutely gorgeous Yorkshire abbeys on the river, with 900-year-old walls… going there when the country was suffering all the uncertainties of a pandemic was very calming,” Mavor says. “This was here through the plagues, through the wars, all the upheavals of history, and it still stands. I think that’s why so many of our free and local sites have seen a lot of people. The connection with the past, the familiarity, the sense of belonging in your community – that’s really where we’ve recognised that looking after the nation’s assets has a really deep importance that we haven’t really seen society articulate before.” Not only did English Heritage’s existing membership stay loyal during the Covid crisis, but another 182,000 people joined.The pandemic also inspired creativity. “One of the team who wasn’t furloughed just worked solidly all through 2020, transferring our audio tours onto mobile devices. BYOD – Bring Your Own Devices – was the new thing.” Takeaway vans and mobile catering proved unexpectedly successful when the usual outlets were closed – a lesson for the future, given that, unlike the National Trust, English Heritage generally owns little land on which to build permanent catering facilities.“Then we streamed the summer solstice. It was the most moving thing. People watched from around the world. It was a showering of love for Stonehenge – a real moment of ‘we’re all in this together, and the sun is still rising’.”While a family ticket to Stonehenge will set you back more than £50 (for non-members), there is surely an issue with sites such as North Leigh: they are free to visit. Doesn’t that concern a chief who has to balance the books, especially without state funding? Mavor sees it differently. For one thing, the enthusiasm of the volunteers at North Leigh has brought a reward, by helping to secure a £1 million donation from the Michael Bishop Foundation, to be shared with Dover Castle, Hardwick Old Hall and Brodsworth Hall and fund conservation work. For another, free is good. When Marble Hill, the Palladian villa built by the mistress of George II near Richmond, reopens in May after a £8 million restoration (thank you, National Lottery Community Fund), there will be no admission charge. Mavor believes that takings from the revamped gift shop, guidebook sales and expanded tea room will more than compensate for the loss of revenue.Forget that I said “king’s mistress” that was the old-school way of telling the stories of Britain’s historical sites. “We’ve taken a completely different view and thought, ‘Hang on a second, who is this woman, Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk? Is there any more to say?’ Fantastic story. She was hard of hearing, she was abused by her husband, she became mistress to the king as a means of getting herself where she needed to be: independent. She then came into her own and held literary salons there. Alexander Pope was one of her regular visitors, he designed a garden for her. We’re bringing all that in to say that this was a really amazing person.”The focus isn’t only on aristocrats. In this age of ersity, Blue Plaques (an English Heritage responsibility) are being erected to remember the Match Girls’ Strike of 1888, an early industrial action taken largely by teenage girls against atrocious working conditions in London’s East End, and a refuge for ayahs in Hackney (ayahs were nannies from the empire brought to the UK and then possibly abandoned). Landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson will be remembered with a plaque at her old home in Bloomsbury. Another plaque will mark the site of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies’ headquarters in Westminster. It’s all about telling the stories of London’s working class and the capital’s women.“We’re always trying to find the stories of underrepresented groups,” Mavor says. On a Blue Plaque, there is space for just 13 words, which would leave precious little space for woke preaching. Thank heavens that’s not the English Heritage style.More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionWe’re taking action to keep Britain safe from Russia’s malicious activitiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lake district","story":"Evening is falling in Chapel Stile, Cumbria, but only a few houses have their lights on. The windows of the rest of the houses are dark: they are holiday lets or second homes and no-one is at home.Chapel Stile is a Lakeland village in the Langdale valley, where only 14 out of the 164 homes are owned and lived in full-time, according to local estimates. After decades of increasing numbers of second homes in the area, the rise of short-term lettings sites like Airbnb and two years of booming staycations, there has been an increase of 32 per cent in the number of holiday lets in South Lakeland, according to figures from Tim Farron, MP for the area and a former leader of the Liberal Democrats.This dramatic rise has resulted in rocketing housing costs for locals and dwindling footfall for local businesses, which has led Mr Farron to take up the cause in a new campaign. Last month, he raised the issue in a debate in the House of Commons, and he is soon set to discuss the matter with Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government (DHCLG).Jean Birkett is a parish councillor who has lived in Chapel Stile all her life, and she has seen how the village has changed with the encroachment of holiday homes.When she was a teenager, the village was inhabited entirely by local people, working mostly in agriculture. It was a small, close community where “everyone knew everyone”, says Mrs Birkett. The village hall had “something on every night of the week”, whether it was Women’s Institute meetings, dances, hunt balls or the drama club.That bustling community life is almost entirely gone now, reflects Mrs Birkett: “There isn’t even a bonfire now…It’s as dead as dead.“In 20 years there won’t be anyone left.”A brief search of Airbnb shows there are at least 30 properties in the village, and just outside it, that are listed for short-term lets on the site, with others listed elsewhere. It’s not hard to see why.Birkett points to a small, terraced, slate cottage that she used to live in as a teenager. Its neighbour, an identical two-bedroom house, is listed on Airbnb for £940 a week, with an advert boasting that it “was originally a Quarryman’s dwelling”.Locals will have a hard time trying to buy, too. Jobs locally tend to be in the lower-paying service and tourism industries, but homes in the village can go for over £1 million.People complain that the number of holiday rentals makes it nearly impossible to find somewhere to live, especially in a National Park that has tight planning restrictions on building new homes. Carys Grady, 31, spent years looking for a rented home for herself and her partner around the town of Ambleside, on the banks of Lake Windermere and around four miles from Chapel Stile.She started looking eight years ago, checking estate agents’ websites every day for new listings. It took two years just to find anything, with the few properties available being snapped up before they got to them.They eventually found a place, but immediately after moving in discovered it had damp and serious mould, with a patch on the ceiling that was six foot by four foot, according to Miss Grady. When the landlord stalled over fixing it, she started looking for another home, a search that this time took six years.“Because the rental properties are so few and far between they always have you by the short and curlies”, she says. “If you move out then there are 20 or 30 people who will move in.”All this might superficially sound like it’s to the benefit of tourists, who have more properties available to stay in, but Debbie Lumsden, a 52-year-old manager of a bar in Bowness, a town just south of Ambleside, argues that it is not.Last summer, the Cumbrian tourist board found that 85 per cent of hospitality businesses were struggling to find enough staff, as national labour problems caused by the pandemic and Brexit added to local issues in the Lakes.Lumsden says you couldn’t believe “the number of complaints I had from tourists saying they can’t get dinner anywhere”, last summer, and pubs had to “shut on some of the busiest days of the year because they simply didn’t have enough staff.”“We can’t get people into the village because there is nowhere to live”, she says. “A friend in Windermere doesn’t have any neighbours, and she lives on a street with 10 houses…They are all Airbnbs.”Ms Lumsden had her own difficulties trying to find a home last year after her landlord asked her to leave so he could turn her house into a holiday let. After a frantic and fruitless search with estate agents, she considered resigning from her job and leaving the Lake District to move back in with her mum.Luckily, a friend was moving out of Bowness, and she was able to move straight into her flat before it was advertised.Mr Farron has suggested a seven-point plan to deal with the issue, starting with changing law so that property owners would have to apply for planning permission to turn a property into a second home or holiday let.Another proposal is closing tax loopholes, which currently allow second home owners to dodge paying council tax. At present, many second home owners are instead paying the lower business rates whether or not they have actually rented out their properties – all they need to do is declare an intention to do it.It appears the government has taken notice, and last month it announced that this would only be available on genuine holiday lets, which are occupied by holidaymakers for at least 70 nights a year, and that owners would otherwise have to pay council tax. Farron wants this to go further, giving councils the power to increase council tax by up to 100 per cent on second homes and holiday lets in the most affected areas.A spokesman for Airbnb said: “Across the UK, the majority of Hosts share space in their own home and nearly a third of UK Hosts say that the additional income is an economic lifeline.“We take housing concerns seriously and have already put forward proposals to the government for a national registration system for hosts, following talks with communities and leaders across the UK. The UK government has committed to taking forward a registration system and we look forward to supporting the upcoming consultation.”A spokesman for DHCLG said: “We’re taking decisive action to combat the adverse impact that second homes and holiday lets can have on local communities – particularly in areas such as the Lake District.“We have introduced a higher rate of stamp duty for second homes, increased councils’ powers to charge second homeowners the full council tax rate and tightened up tax rules for second home owners.“We’re also delivering more affordable housing, including 4,100 affordable homes in Cumbria since 2010, and our new First Homes scheme will help to ensure that local people are prioritised in the sale of affordable housing.”More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionWe’re taking action to keep Britain safe from Russia’s malicious activitiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell group universities accused profiting students misery","story":"The pandemic has led to a £2.2 billion cash boom for the UK’s top universities amid accusations that they are “profiting from students’ misery”.Spiralling grade inflation after exams were axed and teachers’ predictions were used instead meant that Russell Group institutions have undergone their biggest expansion of student numbers in over a decade.The country’s most prestigious universities have collectively amassed a surplus of over £2.2 billion, according to analysis of their latest annual accounts by The .Information obtained under freedom of information requests by The  also reveals that the 24 members of the Russell Group were collectively handed over £115 million from the Government in furlough money.Vice-chancellors are facing fresh calls to give students a refund, with parents pointing out that youngsters have “only been getting a fraction” of the normal university experience.Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, said: “What better use for these surplus could there be than to give students their money back who haven\u0027t had proper face to face teaching?”He added that the higher education regulator should work with universities to ensure “students get the money back they deserve”.Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem, said it is “outrageous” that students have paid the same tuition fees for the past two years.She said: “The first thing to do is to offer the students and then the taxpayer a refund. Why are universities profiting from students\u0027 misery?”It comes as thousands of students faced further disruption this week after lecturers from 68 universities around the country went on strike amid a row over pensions and working conditions.Not all universities accepted money through the furlough scheme, with Queen Mary University London stating that given the healthy state of its finances it took the principled decision not to access it.Analysis by The  found that all but two of the Russell Group members ran a surplus during 2020-21. Nine of them ran an even larger surplus than they did the previous year, their annual accounts showed.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: “These surpluses are what you would expect of an institution in normal times - but it is extraordinary relative to the predictions of the sector at the start of the crisis.”“There was a fear early in the crisis that the Russell Group universities would be the worst affected because of international students not coming and they are the ones that pay the really high fees.“But in reality the international students have kept coming and because of grade inflation home students have flocked to Russell Group universities too.”The National Union of Students said the surplus figures are “truly appalling” adding: “It’s completely unfathomable that so many universities have profited throughout the pandemic.“Whilst students were accessing food banks, being threatened with evictions and visa withdrawals, universities continued to put students last.”In 2020-21, the number of first year undergraduates at the country’s top universities increased by 11.9 per cent, official data shows, which includes nine per cent growth in the number of overseas students. This is the largest year-on-year increase in over 10 years and is three times the growth of the rest of the sector during the pandemic.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said that universities have generally weathered the storm of the pandemic effectively and are well placed to deal with future economic ruptures.She added that students have endured an “exceptionally difficult time through the pandemic”, which has been brought into “sharp focus” this week as a fresh round of lecturer strikes got underway.A Russell Group spokesperson said that their members have “worked hard to prioritise students and provide the best possible experience” during the pandemic, including “investing significantly in digital learning and increasing wider support services”.They pointed out that in-person teaching continued for essential courses throughout the pandemic and since September has been in place for the “vast majority” of courses.The spokesman said that members “worked tirelessly” to accommodate “as many students as possible” when using teachers’ predicted grades meant that far more than expected received top grades.Cuts in the value of tuition fees due to rising inflation mean that courses for British students are run at a deficit of up to £2,400 per medical student and £1,000 for those studying classroom-based subjects.More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionWe’re taking action to keep Britain safe from Russia’s malicious activitiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"taking action keep britain safe russias malicious activities","story":"The situation in Ukraine remains critical. As colleagues across government and friends around the world have said, an invasion by Russia would have disastrous and costly consequences for both countries, with an impact felt across the entire globe.The Government is doing everything it can to support British nationals still in Ukraine following the formal advice to leave. My department has taken quick and decisive action to support them and their families to travel to the UK. This has included implementing a dedicated visa helpline, prioritising family visas from Ukraine so they are processed in days rather than weeks, waiving the family visa application fee and ensuring that eligible family members of British nationals are granted a visa. Dedicated teams have also been prioritising passport applications – including surrogacy cases – and supporting the Foreign Office to issue emergency travel documents. All applicants are subject to rigorous checks to ensure that security is not compromised.While we seek to get British nationals to safety, the Russian Government is waging a disinformation campaign. This should come as no surprise and we should be prepared for more disinformation we have seen it before, but we must look beyond it. From fabricating stories about the shooting down of the Malaysian airliner, MH17, in 2014, to the absurd excuses of the Russian agents who claimed they were visiting Salisbury Cathedral when they were actually deploying a military-grade nerve agent which killed a British person on British soil, we know the Russian regime follows a pattern of disinformation and deception to attempt to hide its outrageous actions.We are already seeing an escalation of Russian information operations clearly intended to provide a pretext for military action against Ukraine and we should expect to see more of this as the crisis develops, including information warfare and cyber attacks aimed at the West. The UK Government Information Cell has brought together our counter-disinformation expertise to identify and tackle Russian information aggression targeted at the UK.Since Salisbury we’ve made strides to disrupt malign influences in the UK. Following that attack, 23 Russian intelligence officers masquerading as diplomats were expelled from this country. The 2019 Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act gave specially-trained police officers new powers to stop, question, detain and search iniduals travelling through UK ports to determine whether they are involved in hostile state activity.In the last two years, the UK has introduced new sanctions regimes targeting those involved in serious corruption as well as those perpetrating some of the gravest human rights violations and abuses around the world. Last week, we took action to strengthen and expand our Russia sanctions regime, so that a greater number of iniduals and businesses with links to the Kremlin will fall within scope. This will exert the greatest pressure on Russia to change course.I am committed to taking the strongest action possible to prevent criminals, kleptocrats and corrupt elites from exploiting our financial system and threatening our national security. Dirty money and corruption are at the heart of the Russian government and I will not accept the business model of stealing in Russia to spend abroad in places like the UK. That is why I have closed the golden visa scheme for good to eliminate the opportunity for people to pay their way into the country. We are intensifying our response to illicit financial flows, including from Russia, such as bringing forward legislation to unmask ownership of offshore properties in the UK.Dirty money linked to the Kremlin is not welcome in this country and I will use all the powers at my disposal against iniduals who seek to harm our democracy and our people. They pose an irrefutable risk to the UK and global security, with associations and links to a full spectrum of crimes. We know who you are and will not hesitate to use our law and immigration enforcement powers against you with our international allies. But I will go further by introducing legislation to completely overhaul our powers to counter threats from foreign states and update our antiquated espionage laws. These powers will apply to any state conducting hostile activity on our soil and will make us much more resilient to foreign interference in the UK.Any conflict in Ukraine would not just be a foreign quarrel about which we know little. Its effects would be felt here too. In recent weeks this has included reports of malicious cyber incidents in Ukraine which bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity. Our National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has confirmed that past Russian cyber activity has included attempted interference against UK media, telecommunications and energy infrastructure, and cyber criminals in Russia have targeted well-known firms in recent high-profile attacks.As Home Secretary, keeping the British public safe remains my number one priority and I will continue to discuss with my Five Eyes counterparts – as well as other allies – the further collective action we can take to protect our homeland security. The UK continues to work tirelessly alongside our allies to persuade Russia to step back from the brink, ensuring that we support the sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as protect ourselves at home and British nationals in Ukraine.We and our allies urge Russia to de-escalate, re-engage and choose the path of diplomacy. A further Russian military incursion would be not only a strategic mistake, but a political, military, humanitarian and financial disaster with nothing but tragic conclusions.More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionBoris Johnson set to be among first to learn fate in ‘partygate’ investigationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"water companies should ensure one stretch river area safe swim","story":"The Government and water companies must ensure that more stretches of rivers are regularly tested to ensure they are safe enough to swim in, MPs have said.More than 80 per cent of people expect to be able to safely swim in a local river, new polling for the  has found, despite Government officials insisting they are not intended for human use.Swimmers are falling ill in water they assume to be clean, making it “critically important” to monitor popular areas for human safety, Philip Dunne, the Conservative chair of Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee, told the .His views are backed by 76 per cent of people in England polled for the  by Opinium as part of its Clean Rivers Campaign, who said they would expect the Government to issue warnings about rivers if they were deemed unsafe to swim in.The EAC has called on the Government to support monitoring on at least one stretch of river in each water company area by 2025.By designating a stretch of a river as “bathing water”, the environment ministry will commit to monitoring it throughout the summer months for dangerous levels of bacteria, which can be caused by sewage or agricultural runoff.A recent report from the committee said England’s rivers are contaminated with a “chemical cocktail” of sewage, slurry and plastic.Fewer than one in five people believe England’s rivers are safe to swim in, but 83 per cent of respondents say at least some should be clean enough. Nearly one-third say all rivers in England should be fit for people to swim in.More than one-third also say they have seen visible pollution, such as plastic or chemicals, in England’s rivers, and around a quarter have noticed a reduction in fish and wildlife.Only one inland site in England has bathing water status, at the River Wharfe in Ilkley, which was rated poor in the first tests on the site earlier this year. That compares to 32 in Germany, 76 in Poland and 420 in France.The Environment Agency has insisted that rivers are not intended for people to swim in, but water minister Rebecca Pow told the  this week that people should “absolutely” be able to.Around a dozen sites are now hoping to gain the status in coming months, including an application by Port Meadow on the River Thames at Oxford which is now being considered by the environment ministry.Some want the Government to go even further, with the Wildlife and Countryside Link saying they should consider designating a minimum of two inland bathing waters every year.The push reflects a rise in the popularity of outdoor swimming in recent years, with Outdoor Swimmer reporting as much as a threefold rise in participation between 2019 and 2021.That has coincided with growing concern over the frequent dumping of sewage into England’s rivers by water companies, which has left outdoor swimmers at risk of illness.Agricultural runoff can also cause explosions in the growth of algae, which can be toxic to dogs, as well as harmful to people.MPs heard evidence from the Rivers Trust that the designation of stretches of rivers as bathing waters “could drive action to clean up pollution from all sources, including water company assets, private sewerage, agriculture, road run-off and minewater”.Citizen scientists who have been testing the water at popular bathing spots have found levels of bacteria that were far higher than acceptable limits for human contact.The Oxford Rivers Project found bacteria levels were on average twice the recommended safety threshold during the wet summer months of May and June, which put swimmers at risk of illness, at sites it tested near Port Meadow. It found the source of the bacteria was treated and untreated sewage entering the river.“We hear of too many instances where river users have fallen ill after swimming in rivers they assumed were safe,” said Philip Dunne.“Having more rivers in England of bathing quality status can help this: it requires robust monitoring of bacterial levels and as a result, data is made available for river users to make an informed and timely judgement on whether they wish to go in the water.”“Making rivers safe for recreational enjoyment, and improving the health of river ecosystems, is critically important.”“I am encouraged that water companies themselves are starting to identify stretches of rivers where they would like to declare bathing water status, such as Severn Trent on the River Leam and River Teme, and Thames Water on the River Thames in Oxford.”Ms Pow told the  she expected to see a lot more rivers gaining bathing water status in coming months.“I\u0027ve made a real proviso in encouraging it, in terms of highlighting to local authorities that they can apply,” she said. “A lot of citizen groups are latching on to this now because they know it is a way they can get a special focus on their stretch of rivers to get it cleaned up.”More from NewsEnd mass Covid testing in schools now, MPs and peers tell GovernmentWind farms were paid not to generate half their potentialUkraine crisis: We’ll make it impossible for Russia to raise funds in City, says Boris JohnsonAs Ukraine tensions rise, UK organisations should protect themselves from cyber threatsBritain warns of Russian cyber attacks as companies urged to take defensive actionWe’re taking action to keep Britain safe from Russia’s malicious activitiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg profits investments","story":"Exclusive: Jacob Rees-Mogg profits from investments in Russian gas giant and Chinese pharma firmLast year Jacob Rees-Mogg made an estimated £, in idends from Somerset Capital Management, the firm he co-founded before becoming an MP and still has shares in Image: REUTERSByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  Feb |commentsMulti-millionaire Tory minster Jacob Rees-Mogg is profiting from investments in a Russian gas giant and Chinese pharma firm. Last year he made an estimated £, in idends from Somerset Capital Management, the firm he co-founded before becoming an MP and still has shares in.But Labour Deputy leader Angela Rayner has national security concerns about dealing with such companies in countries which are Britain’s enemies.She said: “From Vladimir Putin’s puppets to private Chinese health corporations, Rees-Mogg’s investments raise serious questions about security. “Ministers cannot be allowed to influence policy decisions they have financial interests in and any conflicts should always be properly notied. “Labour would overhaul the system and establish an independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to ensure no one is making financial gains from their access to Government.”  As a minister Mr Rees-Mogg, , is banned from playing any role in Somerset’s business affairs. But he is allowed to pocket idends as a sleeping shareholder from profits Somerset makes.And now Boris Johnson has switched his job from Commons leader to minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency he will be in charge of sweeping away EU rules.Mr Rees-Mogg will also be looking at emerging markets for future UK trade deals. But Steve Goodrich of Transparency International said: “It’s risky business when ministers hold briefs relating to their personal financial affairs, and even more so when there’s a lot of money at stake.” Somerset invests £.million on behalf of its clients in the Chinese pharmaceutical and healthcare company WuXi AppTec which stands to benefit as medicines are deregulated following the UK’s EU exit.Somerset manages assets of more than £billion, and also invests £.million on behalf of clients in Russia’s largest privately owned gas company Novatek PJSC-GDR chaired by Vladimir Putin crony Leonid Mikhelson. Both Mr Mikhelson and the company now face sanctionsthe Russian president carries out his threat to invade Ukraine. WuXi is expanding in Britain acquiring Oxford-based gene therapy company Oxgene in March  in a £million deal.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “It’s very important we recognise China as a threat, not as a competitor.“We now need to start pulling back from China and find other markets and places that we can do business with.”  And MI chief Ken McCullum yesterday warned that Russia and China are both desperate to gain a foothold in Parliament by targeting MPs. Somerset management commentary in November  said: “We still think there is a broad number of attractive companies in China that provide the combination of factors we are looking for:” Mr Rees-Mogg has shareholdings in Somerset Capital valued at more than £,, according to the Commons Register of Interests, and remains a partner though he has been unpaid since .Joshua Ausden of Somerset said: “ Jacob Rees-Mogg no longer works at Somerset Capital and has had no role in any of the firm’s investment decisions for over a decade.‘Any partnership interest in Somerset is held in abeyance, in accordance with the ministerial code. “Somerset Capital’s funds, including the Somerset Asia Income Fund and Somerset Emerging Markets Dividend Growth Fund, are solely mandated to invest in Asian and Emerging Markets equities.” In  Somerset said its investors had a “once in a generation” chance of “super normal s” because of the Covid pandemic.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse.

Dominic Good was in a work conference call at his home on Friday morning when he heard an almighty crash.The -year-old said his family are very lucky that no one was injured after the huge oak tree crashed through the roof of their house in Brentwood during Storm Eunice.The father-of-two said his we Emma, his -year-old son Sven and his sonaposs girlfriend Anna Parnanen had all been in dferent rooms of the house working when the tree crashed down.  He said: A big gust just snapped the base of the massive oak tree in our garden, that is probably around  years old. The whole tree fell on the northwest corner of the house and the roof took the brunt of it. The roof is pretty much destroyed, and my son and my daughteraposs bedrooms are completely filled with rubble.His son also had his Mazda MX car completely crushed by the branches of the toppled oak. Mr Good said: My son was in the room directly belowso he actually witnessed it. He just grabbed his laptop and grabbed the dog and ran out of the room. The family had predicted there could be some storm damage from the huge gusts of wind but never expected the level of destruction that transpired.I was concerned that a branch might strike the house or something because it was incredibly strong wind, but that was something , said Mr Good. We were very lucky that none of the dogs or the people that were in the house were affected in any way...other than just breathing in dust. The family were able to spend the night in their home but are unsure as yetthis will be possible once the tree is removed.Mr Good added: We spent the rest of Friday trying to salvage stuff out of the rooms but everything is covered in dust and rubble and was just a general mess. I think probably once they remove the tree from the house they will have to knock down quite a large part of the house and rebuild it. We will just have to speak to the insurance company and take it from there.  At least four died in the UK and Ireland during one of the worst storms in decades, which saw gusts of winds of mph provisionally recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight. The bad weather is set to continue all weekend and the Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind covering the entire south coast and south-west Wales until pm on Saturday and a yellow snow warning for parts of northern England from am until pm.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The powerful storm has resulted in planes struggling to land in high winds, damage to the roof of the O arena in London, and the spire of St Thomas Church in Wells, Somerset, crashing to the ground. The Association of British Insurershas said previous similar storms have cost around £ million in repairs.Hundreds of journeys were cancelled on Friday as people were told to stay at home, and National Rail has warned there is still major disruption to services across most of Great Britain.

The pups arrived all at once at Many Tears Animal Rescue in Carmarthenshire, Wales after being destined to become working service animals seeking illegal drugs and explosives. The busy, happy and friendly dogs now need new homes and the rescue centre is seeking owners who can keep up with the energetic pooches, Wales Online reports.Many tears owner Sylvia Van Atta said: They all came from somebody with a contract to look after dogs going to be trained as bomb or drug dogs. But they have decided not to continue with that.  There are a lot of young dogs, and they all needed worming but they are well socialised. They had been bred for working and prepared to be service dogs. They are busy, happy and friendly dogs and any home needs to be a busy family. They are dogs that want to be doing something. They are bred for their brains and they are very agile. So they are ok to be pets, but they need someone who will throw balls, who will stimulate them. They are not dogs who will be happy to just sit by the fire all the time.All the dogs need to be vaccinated, wormed and spayed neuteredthey are old enough. Many Tears is also inviting people to contribute towards the cost of their care. Anyone wanting to meet the labs can do so during the centreaposs showarounds on weekdays at midday, and at am on weekends.They will all be available for adoption at the Many Tears website.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogsOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

But the proposal to make Ms Ingram-Moore CEO was allegedly made by trustees without a recruitment competition. The Charities Commission intervened last summer after it was contacted by the Foundation. Now the Foundation has told The Independent Ms Ingram-Moore has taken the decision that the CEO role was not something she wished to pursue” so she could focus on other commitments. The £, salary is comparable to the highest earner at the RSPCA, which paid out a maximum of £, to one inidual last year. Industry publication, Third Sector ranked the animal rescue charity as just th in its list of top  highest-earning charities list. But the organisation still raked in a total income of £ million - some . times more than that of the Captain Tom Foundation. Ms Ingram-Moore, who has spoken about setting up the foundation, was appointed a trustee of the charity on February , , but resigned on March , according to accounts.Her husband, Colin, was appointed a trustee on the same date and remains in post as the family’s representative. At the time the couple officially sought permission for their appointments as per the rules of the Charities Commission which state that trustees or “connected” people should seek written consent from the watchdog before being employed by the charity. When The Independent approached the Foundation for comment, the paper claims the organisation initially appeared to deny that the six-figure salary was proposed. Stephen Jones, chair of the board of trustees, said: “The decision to make an application for consent to appoint Hannah Ingram-Moore in a temporary role as interim CEO was made by the independent trustees who undertook a benchmarking exercise to assess an appropriate salary for the role. Any discussions with the Charity Commission are highly confidential but your reference to a ‘six-figure salary’ is categorically denied.” When reminded that an initial application to appoint Ms Ingram-Moore as CEO, rather than in an interim role, had already been seen, the paper asked whether Mr Jones whether the organisation was denying that they sought the Charity Commission’s permission to appoint her as CEO.  They pointedly refuted that claim and a further comment was released by the foundation. It read: In , the foundation approached the commission for consentwith regard to the appointment of Hannah Ingram-Moore as CEO. As part of that process for consent, the trustees undertook a formal benchmarking exercise to assess an appropriate salary for the role. “That report made recommendations to the trustees as to an appropriate salarybased on a spectrum of charities operating with equivalent financial positions and charitable activity. This was provided to the commission as part of the application for consent, in the interests of full disclosure, together with a proposal by the trustees as to what the salary for the CEO role should be. “It is the commission’s responsibility to consider and challenge any application for consent, but in any event during the trustees’ discussions with the commission, Hannah Ingram-Moore took the decision that the CEO role was not something she wished to pursue as she wanted to focus on other commitments, both personally and professionally. However, she committed to support the trustees during an interim period, subject to commission consent being obtained. “On that basis, the commission were supportive of and provided the trustees with formal consent for Hannah Ingram-Moore to be appointed as interim CEO from August  for a defined nine-month period. The trustees revisited their salary considerations as part of the discussions with the commission, before making a decision on what that salary should be. That salary will of course be disclosed as required in the accounts for the relevant period but is categorically not six figures. “The trustees are, as agreed with the commission, in the process of undertaking an open recruitment process to identy and recruit a CEO. The detail on that and on the role and salary expectations is a matter of public record. That process is ongoing, but regardless Hannah Ingram-Moore will step down as interim CEO at the end of April and the trustees are grateful for her support during this period.”  In December  a document seen by the Independent outlines an aposappointment briefapos for the role of CEO for Ms Ingram-Moore with a listed salary of £,-£,, it reports. The Charities Commission launched its compliance case against the foundation in March last year but would not comment on the matter beyond the public statement it had given at the time. A spokesperson for the commission said: “We have been in ongoing contact with the trustees of the Captain Tom Foundation on its set-up and governance arrangements and as part of this work will now assess the charity’s recently submitted accounts.” Ms Ingram-Moore’s personal website – which describes her as “one of Britain’s leading businesswomen” – listed her as “founder and CEO” of the Captain Tom Foundation but this was later changed to “founder and interim CEO”.

Sunday Russell, , from Glasgow, was enjoying a night out with partner Martina Bressamutti, , and some other friends at a bar in Venice, Italy, at the time of the incident on February , Daily Record reports.As the night went on, the boyfriend of a female friend in the group became aggressive towards his girlfriend, and homophobic towards Sunday and their partner. After the man was finally asked to leave, he dragged Sunday out onto the street, restraining them as he rained down a brutal flurry of punches to the face. They said: My face was on the ground and he was hitting me and restraining me.He was being homophobic and transphobic and telling me he was going to kill me and kick my face in. It was so scary.Sundayaposs partner Martina had managed to pull the man off them by the time local carabinieri, Italian paramilitary police, arrived at the scene.Sunday has been left with a severe metacarpal fracture in their right hand following the assault.

In the past, sheaposs proved to be an accomplished photographer having taken gorgeous photos of her family. And sheaposs also a talented drawer and showed off her artwork in the order of service created for her sister Pippaaposs wedding. But thereaposs one creative hobby that Kate revealed she picked up in order to create a very special present for her eldest son Prince George. However, she was later forced to admit the present turned out to be a disaster as she was really bad at the skill.  So what was the hobby  Knitting! Kate first revealed she was trying her hand at knitting way back in  when she was pregnant with George. According to Hello!, she told a group of royal fans while visiting Glasgow: Iaposve been trying to knit and Iaposm really bad. I should be asking for tips! In , during a trip to Bradford, Kate visited Older Yet Wiser - an organisation that supports grandparents - and met with some grandmothers who were showing off their crocheting skills.

And there she confessed that her attempts to knit George a jumper had completely failed. She told the group: I tried knitting when I first had George. I tried to knit him a very special jumper, but I got halfway down and it splattered. Itaposs such an amazing skill. However, maybe Kate took her own advice and persevered with learning how to knit after telling children to face their fears last week   Her advice came during her appearance on CBeebies Bedtime Stories last Sunday. Kate, dressed in jeans and a £ Fair Isle Jumper, read children’s classic The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark. The book, by Jill Tomlinson, tells the story of baby barn owl Plop, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears. The Duchess chose the book to mark Children’s Mental Health Week.  The mother of three looked snug as she sat in a wooded area with a hot chocolate within reach, two soft toy owls for company and a lit fire bowl.At the end of the reading, she added: “Wow, what an encouraging tale. “We can all feel scared sometimes just like our little owl friend Plop, but as Mrs Barn Own said, ‘It’s better to find out about the things that scare us before we make up our mind’. “And with the help of others, we can often face things that worry us.

Solid paved driveways do not allow water to soak into the ground and rely on drains instead.But this excess water can have a knock on effect on sewage systems, causing them to overflow and lead to drainage issues for the area and its surroundings.Minister for water Rebecca Pow told thethat driveways should be able to stop this from happening.We need to have semi-permeable membranes on our driveways rather than Tarmac so that rainwater doesnapost rush away but soaks in, she said. The Tory minister explained that developers might have to prove they had sustainable drainage systems before they were permitted to connect to sewage networks to avoid pumping rivers with waste. It comes under the Clean Rivers campaign in her Somerset constituency of Taunton Deane. Ministers are still looking at buildersapos right to connect and whether or not they only offer this to those with sustainable drainage.  Major housing developments might also have to invest in new sewage infrastructure to avoid overwhelming the existing system, reports suggest. Parliament is also considering whether to create ponds where water can soak into the ground rather than running into drains which can cause sewage systems to overflow. Ms Pow said that Britain needs to be more sustainably conscious and look at the really big picture in order to have the best possible housing. But her initiative may put a spanner in the works for the housing ministry which aims to build , new homes each year.  Semipermeable driveways are another alternative for Brits wanting to help tackle river pollution. The material soaks up water and retains it rather than allowing it to rush towards drains. Pollution from raw sewage being offloaded into rivers has recently risen up the political agenda. Ms Pow said water companies have started to monitor their storm overflows in the last five years and that the government is acting fast on what used to be a hidden problem. “We’ve literally prioritised this more than it’s ever been prioritised, she added.The minister also hoped Michael Gove might be sympathetic towards her objective to make sustainable housing developments, as a former member Defra member.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SomersetConservative PartyMichael GovePoliticsHousingSewagePollutionproperty newsHousing and Urban Development\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She now has just one lungGiovanna Distefano was diagnosed with cancer after complaining of a stf neckByAmy SharpeNews Reporter:,  Feb |comments A mum battled back to health with just one lung after the other was removed so docs could cut out a giant tumour. Giovanna Distefano, , was out running five times a week with no idea she had a tumour nearly  inches long between her lungs.It was found thanks only to a scan after she complained of a stf neck, which was unrelated to the cancer. Doctors who found the rare stage  thymoma in her chest told her she might have “just months to live” – leaving single mum Giovanna fearing for her daughter Allagra, three. She said: “I’d promised my daughter I was going to be there for her – it was horrible thinking I wasn’t going to be able to honour that.”  The nine-hour op to remove the growth the diameter of a football had never been done before in Britain, and is among just a handful globally. Carried out in October, it was ­successful beyond Giovanna’s wildest dreams – and four months on she is cancer-free. She said: “I feel like I’m living again.” The beauty salon owner from Hackney, East London, had contacted a private doctor about a stfness in her neck in January last year.She was referred for NHS scans at nearby Homerton University Hospital, which revealed the thymoma growing between her lungs – and which Giovanna was told was inoperable.A thymoma is a cancer of the thymus gland, the part responsible for making white blood cells which help the body fight infection. It affects just  people in every million, and thymomas bigger than . inches are rare – making Giovanna’s one of the biggest ever known. Within a month of it being discovered, Giovanna had contacted the man who was to prove her lesaver – surgeon Andrea Bille at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London.His team has successfully operated on  other patients who had previously been told there was no treatment. Before the op, Giovanna first had three rounds of chemotherapy, losing her hair in the process. But the treatment was stopped when she caught Covid and was rushed to hospital. She said: “I felt my lungs were failing, they felt like jellyfish. My biggest fear was never seeing my daughter again.” She was kept in hospital for two weeks with Covid-related pneumonia, and then needed to recover before she could risk surgery. When she finally had the op, doctors warned there was a % chance she would not survive. But mum Giovanna said: “I knew they would save my le, so I told them, ‘I’m doing it’.” The surgeons found that, to tackle the tumour, they would have to remove her left lung. But Giovanna remained in good spirits when they gave her the news. She said: “I was just glad it was a success. “The nurses were surprised to see me and I said, ‘Yes, I told you I wasn’t going to die’.” She was discharged eight days later and is being monitored and has physio, but currently needs no further treatment. Surgeon Andrea said: “I’m delighted to see her getting back to normal.” Giovanna added: “I was worried my daughter might be scared to see me looking so ill. “But I explained, ‘Mummy has got an ouchie so I need you to be gentle’. Every day she checks my ouchie. “I’m walking two or three miles a day now – a bit like a -year-old woman, but I’m doing it.

Marianne Kiley, , who uses the service, told Birmingham Live : I donapost think Iaposm going to be able to survive to be perfectly honest.Ms Kileyaposs le was turned upside down last year when she lost her home in Stourport following a devastating fire. She suffers with rheumatoid arthritis and her daughter has epilepsy. The family spent  nights living on the streets and now live nearby in Willenhall. The mum said she is currently receiving Universal Credit and is in the process of applying for Personal Independence Payment which can help with extra living costs for those with a long term condition or disability which means they struggle with every day tasks. I had a sanction on my benefits. I should have had full payment on the sixth but Iaposve only had half of what Iaposm entitled to so Iaposm having to live without gas and electric on the meter, Ms Kiley said. Itaposs been a horrendous few months. Chris Moss, , worked as a roofer for  years. He had to give up work  months ago as heaposs got degenerative arthritis in both his knees. He currently lives on £ a week after his rent and council tax has been paid.  Iaposm constantly worrying. Iaposm worried sick about my next gas bill, he admits. The granddad said he has stopped putting on the heating to keep energy bills at bay. I donapost have it on. The fire will go on in the morning on two bars but thataposs it, he said. I lie on the sofa with a quilt on. No part of the house is heated, the bedroom is freezing. Thataposs the way Iaposve got to do it, I canapost have it on. Itaposs the way of le.  Mr Moss also tried to get extra help through PIP but so far he has been judged as not meeting the criteria. I applied for PIP but was refused. You have to have so many points. Itaposs incredibly dficult, he added. I have become a professional in reduced prices at Morrisons. I wait till .pm and get the meat reduced by  per cent. Itaposs the only way I can eat those sorts of things.  Itaposs demeaning. I used to be on £ a week, now Iaposm on £. My savings have gone. I worked for  years but I couldnapost save with three kids and a mortgage. Iaposm thankful Iaposve got this much money so I can keep a roof over my head. Steve Preen, , is also struggling. He too has had his benefits sanctioned after missing a job centre appointment, which he says was due to a death in the family. Iaposve been coming here quite frequently, he said.  At the moment Iaposm looking after somebody in my flat. I budget how much Iaposve got to go round. It is a struggle. When asked about rising energy bills, he said: I keep it on as much as possible but I am concerned about bills going up. Bridging the Gap has been operating for around a decade squeezed into a row of shops in Willenhall. Hardy volunteers run the site, packing in tins, boxes, bottles and loaves of bread into every available nook and cranny.  The nearby Morrisons supermarket donates much of the food through its community scheme, while other items come from local churches and members of the public. Kathy Tonry, who heads the service, said she worries about what will happen to regular food bank users when the cost of living crisis intensies over the coming months. The fuel crisis is only just starting to hit so I suspect in the coming months weaposre going to see another increase, she said.  It can be the people you expect, the people on benefits, but we have had professional people as well. This could be a nurse, or someone like that, who is struggling. It can be anybody that needs us. The food bank saw a spike in visitors following the removal of the temporary £-per-week uplt to Universal Credit which was introduced to help the worst-off get through the pandemic.  Critics labelled the removal cruel while defenders of the government said the move was never intended to be permanent. Father Mike Batchelor, who works alongside Ms Tonry, says: A lot of people came to depend on the £ Universal Credit. When that was taken away it became a lot busier. Ms Tonry said Universal Credit is not working at present.  She added: People who have good jobs are worrying. Iaposm a little bit worried about my utility bills going up and Iaposve got quite a well-paid job. If Iaposm struggling, those who are on a lower income and are on benefits are really going to struggle. What are they going to do  Theyaposre going to choose between heating or eating and nobody should be in that situation.  Those on benefits and those on lower incomes, theyaposre really going to struggle and this is the time for clients that I hope will access our servicesthey need it. In an ideal world people wouldnapost need food banks, they wouldnapost have to access them to get the basics in le but until the benefits system improves, until people get a decent wage thataposs not going to happen.  The food bank has proved invaluable from those who have come to rely on it during hard times. As well as providing meals, they also provide financial advice and refer those struggling to pay their bills to support services. Ms Kiley said: We havenapost been getting support from the right people. Somebody mentioned Bridging the Gap and they have been absolutely amazing. They helped us with clothing, food, gas and electric.  Mr Moss said: Itaposs an absolute leline. This is brilliant, he says, pointing to a box of fresh fruit and veg. Fruit is a luxury. Mr Preen echoed: Itaposs been brilliant. I canapost fault them. But they also expressed the view that it should not be down to food banks to be there for them in their hour of need. Ms Kiley says: I think the Government needs to do something. Iaposve been given half my benefits. I asked for help and they said no. Mr Moss added: There should be more help for people like me.

Aidan Daly, , carried out the construction work in his spare time, forking out £, on building materials, furnishings and other costs. His we and dad also chipped in and helped transform the site in Kells, County Meath, Ireland, from a field of oats into a magnicent home. He started the project in  and finally finished the landscaping in , selling the property for £, last year. Aidan told The Mirror: “People have said it’s an absolute paradise. I enjoyed every minute of building it. “It was something I built up from nothing. I’d recommend building your own house to anyone. I more than doubled my money.  “You also get to make your own decisions on the house,you don’t like a wall you can just move it. We repainted one of the rooms three times in one week. “It’s very rewardingyou are brave enough. But it has become more expensive since I did it as material prices have gone through the roof in the past two years.” Aidan started work on the three-quarter acre plot in December .  He said: There were crops in the field at the time, it was a field of oats. It was my parentsapos land so the plot was free. His first step was to lay a concrete slab foundation, before erecting the walls and putting the roof on. The rafters were up by March  and he covered the roof in tiles in the summer.  Aidan’s dad Michael, , had taught him how to roof in his early teens and he was working as a self-employed roofer at the time so the work went off without a hitch. He also installed windows, the wiring and plumbing – skills he picked up over the years from being on work sites. “It turns out it’s not that complicated. The plumbing was straight forward. With the electrics I had to get certied by the regulatory authority,” he said.  “It’s even easier to do now you have YouTube videos, I could have done with some of them back then.” However, Aidan did not feel confident plastering the property himself so he brought in some outside help in . He then painted the home and moved in at the end of the year.  Aidan added: “I thought I was finished. Then I met my future weand she thought the finishes could be improved so over the following year we re-did the house room by room. “I also built a garage in  to store my parents’ stuff when they were moving homes. Then in  we did the upstairs of the house. I had a man cave in the attic but Fiona thought it had more potential.  “We put a master bedroom up there and had a window fitted looking out onto the lawn. We also put in a walk-in wardrobe dressing room and two en-suite bathrooms. “Fiona did a lot of the design and most of the painting and shopping. I was doing the hands-on stuff like the ling, flooring, skirting boards, tiling and plumbing.  “We carried out the work bit by bit and it was finished in .” Although the house was complete Aidan and Fiona, , who works as a primary school principal, had still not finished landscaping outside. They first started work on the garden in . Aidan, who now runs his own business Woodbury Custom Homes  Carpentry, said: “We created a decking area for an outdoor kitchen and put a roof over it. It had a BBQ and a TV there. “We also made a pathway to a fire basket and a circular seating area. We planted all these shrubs and tall grasses around the paths.“We had some construction mesh on the decking and bent it so it formed an arch. We then put two hanging chairs, creeping plants and fairy lights all around.” The couple finally finished landscaping in  and decided to put the property on the market the following year.  When Covid hit in  they were worried it could thwart their plans– and their first potential buyer fell through due to the pandemic. Dad-of-two Aidan said: “We received an offer in March  just before the lockdown. But the bank turned them down for a mortgage because of uncertainty from Covid.” The couple were initially disappointed but soon found themselves swamped with viewing bookings.

Both men are believed to be in their early s.In a heartbreaking message online, Jack’s girlfriend Courtney Emmett wrote: “Please God bring my love back to me. I love you Jack.” She added: “It’s all still so very raw.” One of his pals, Bradley Hall paid a touching tribute: “Jack was loved by everyone who’s met him and was always down for a chat. He was a proud father and a loving partner to his girlfriend. “He was his mum’s precious lad and will never be forgotten about.”  Council worker Billy Kinsella, , another dad of one, also died after being hit by a falling tree while clearing debris from a road near his home in Co Wexford. Sinn Fein councillor Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin said: “People in the area are devastated. It is such a tragedy for his we Rita and their only child Conor. “Billy died in the line of duty while out doing council work and attending the scene of a fallen tree. He died in a manner that makes it most tragic.” A woman in her s was killed after a tree fell on a car in Haringey, north London, and a man in his s died in Netherton, Merseyside, after debris struck the vehicle he was travelling in. High winds and snow yesterday continued to cause chaos and bring misery to millions.

The M Severn Bridge remained closed in both directions “due to forecasts of further high winds”. Flood warnings remained in West Sussex and Shropshire. Many train services were cancelled as National Rail reported “major damage” across the network. Parts of Lancashire saw snow and ice, with thrill-seekers evacuated from the Big Dipper rollercoaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach after it ground to a halt. The O Arena remained closed while engineers examined damage to its tent fabric roof. And an incoming flight from Italy to Stansted Airport was forced to ert over  miles to Oslo, Norway, because of high winds. Amid the stories of tragedy, there were also some miracle escapes.  A train managed to stop just  yards before hitting a tree after braking sharply on the Kent coast to Victoria line outside Longfield, near Dartford. A horse had an astonishing escape after ten firefighters spent seven hours freeing him after he was left trapped under three -foot-tall trees that crashed next to him in a field in Ludgershall, Wiltshire. Dad-of-two Dominic Good, , and his family were “very lucky” to remain unscathed after a -year-old oak tree crashed through the roof of their home in Essex.

Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers said: “Every storm is dferent. “But it’s obviously a severe one and is going to affect large parts of the county and built up areas so there will be signicant properly damage.” A Network Rail spokesperson said: “We have got thousands of workers out clearing trees and other debris off the railway.

Charley from Streatham, London, said it is not uncommon for men to do this on the matchmaking app for the LGBT community. But after his match asked for Charleyaposs Facebook details, Hyrmak suddenly turned and began demanding money, or threatened to leak Charleyaposs naked photos to his friendsapos list. In August , Hyrmak of Norbury Crescent, SW was jailed for two years and four months at Croydon Crown Court. He was convicted of eight counts of blackmail and two counts of disclosing photographs and films with intent to cause distress against a string of victims including Charley.Recalling his experience in  to MyLondon, Charley said: He said he was interested in coming over.“He thought he recognised me, so he asked for my phone number to chat on WhatsApp. ‘Fine, it’s easier to chat there,’ I thought.We chatted more, and he asked to look me up on Facebook.” Half an hour later, Charley received an unusual message from his match, asking to borrow £. But when Charley refused, the online beau turned sinister.Charley explained: “I said I was a bit broke, so no. “He then said well ‘how aboutyou give me £, I won’t send all your naked pics to all your Facebook friends. “I googled what to do and it said, apos it’s happening right now, call apos. I went through to the police the lady on the phone was lovely. She said either ignore him, say you’ve called the police, or block him. Thankfully the blackmailer lost interest in Charley after he stopped replying and his nudes were not leaked. But the following day Charley said that he felt victim-blamed by a politan Police officer who came round to take a statement.  As they discussed the events of the previous night Charley claims that the officer said: Wow, stop there why would you send him nude photos ” The officer then added it was not a “normal” thing to do, Charley alleged. “I said it was a normal thing on Grindr,” Charley added. “It felt like I was being victim-blamed, and he was being oblivious.” The rest of Charley’s experience with the Met Police was far better. On the phone and on emails, the police “became lovely again”. They called him up, updated him on the case and told him when they finally apprehended the blackmailer. As well as Charley, Hrymakaposs victims included an auditor, an IT boss, a university admissions officer, and several student nurses. Not all of them had come out to their friends and families, adding additional terror to their experiences. In his victim impact statement, Charley said: I’ve been using the internet to meet other men for well over a decade and I have always considered the internet an important medium for LGBT young people like myself to meet each other. “It made me sad and unnerved to have been the victim of someone who has set out to make online LGBT s a less safe space... The thing about this ordeal that leaves me angriest, most upset and most afraid is that there are still people out there who believe they can make gay men live a s le of fear and shame and I shouldn’t be made to feel like that.” Detective Constable Keval Varia, investigating, said: “The victims in this case were contacted via a male only dating app, however anyone using any form of online dating service, should be wary of sending intimate photographs of themselves. “Think carefully about what you share with people online. “I hope that the sentence handed down brings a measure of closure for the victims.

Fearing the treacherous conditions ahead, Atick scrambled to make a rapid descent and get off the mountain.  But as he did, his backpack - with the £ ring inside - snapped off. The couple is now appealing to climbers and walkers to keep an eye out for the ring and is offering a small reward. Until it’s found - which Atick admits is a long shot – the question he wanted to ask will be left hanging in the air. “I still don’t know whether she’ll say yes or no,” sighed Atick, , who, like Tiana, is a personal trainer.The couple set off up the Pyg Track from Pen y Pass car park at .pm on Monday, having travelled five hours from Attleborough, Norfolk.As they neared the summit, Atick began to tire and took shelter under a rock face. Tiana pressed on, promising toonce she had reached the peak. But following a misunderstanding with climbers on the way down, Atick began his own ascent to the summit.  He said: By now the wind was blowing so much I could hardly stand. “The light had gone and I couldn’t see anything, even with a torch. “I had a signal on my phone, so I called Tiana. She said she would come to me, sliding on her bum down the steps as she couldn’t stand up. “But she rang back saying the wind was too strong, it was too dangerous and she’d have to find another route down.” They agreed to meet at Glaslyn, the lake theyaposd passed on the way up. But Atick was soon lost - left floundering in pitch darkness in howling winds amid snow-capped rocks. He slid down the mountain on his backside, not quite knowing where he was going. At one point he fell down a small waterfall, landing in waist-high water. His backpack straps snapped and, while Atick quickly retrieved the bag, he thinks this is where the engagement ring was lost. Cold, wet and fearing the worst, he kept slipping and sliding downhill. “I followed the line of the waterfall, thinking it must lead somewhere,” he said. “I was sliding, slipping, falling down. I realised no one would find me. “I knew I had to keep going. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t be here today.” Reaching a clf, he followed its edge until, to his relief, he picked out a path. But he had no idea where it led. “I was wet through, shaking with the cold. I tied a scarf over my head to keep warm,” he said. “I ached all over and, when I tried to rest, I began cramping badly. I had nothing more to give.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Miraculously, he saw a torch beam in the blackness and as it drew closer, Atick realised it was Tiana.She had followed the Snowdon Mountain Railway track down the mountain to Llanberis, from where she took a taxi back up to Pen y Pass.Worried for Atick, Tiana had struck out alone back up the mountain, walking around  minutes before she found him at around pm. After helping Atick back down to Pen y Pass, she took him to hospital where he was diagnosed with hyperthermia and given cocodemol to ease his aches. He added: After four or five hours the pain became more manageable. “My hands are still swollen from sliding down the mountain, but I’m feeling stronger now. “Back at the hotel, there was a sense of relief – but also sadness that I never got the chance to ask the question.”He confessed his plans to Tiana, who launched an appeal for the missing ring on Facebook ’s Snowdonia forums.She wrote: “My partner was carrying a secret little yellow and black package, that fell out somewhere on the steepest part of the track, which contained a very specialengagement ring. “The ring has very sentimental value and reward will be rewardedby any chance anyone comes across it.” Facebook users were sympathetic but not overly optimistic. “You lost it in that maze of big rocks ” said one person. Another said: “Oh bless! I hope it’s found! You’ve got the only ring you need! The ring of love.” The white gold ring has a blue sapphire set among small diamonds. It was in a black jewellery box contained within a Goldsmiths black-and-yellow paper gt bag, tied with a black ribbon.

She leaned on a walking stick while awaiting visitors, explaining later: “As you see, I can’t move.” But as aides showed the dignitaries into the room, Her Majesty turned on that dazzling smile and assured them: “I am here.” Well, thank God for that, Ma’am, thought millions of loyal subjects. And while we’re terribly sorry you are having trouble moving around, we really don’t want you to go anywhere. Because the only thing keeping the British monarchy standing right now is the love, respect and admiration earned by our record-breaking Queen.  Her  years of dedicated service have buoyed up the ancient institution and kept Republicanism at bay. Now her family is engulfed in the ­greatest crisis since the abdication of Edward VIII in . The tawdry events of recent days have left many wonderingElizabeth II should be the UK’s final sovereign. The broke Duke of York has just paid a reported £million to a sex abuse ­accuser he claims he never met. So the public want to knowhis mother bailed him out from her “personal” Duchy of Lancaster fortune – which should arguably be going to the Treasury. The good people of York feel their city has been tainted and want him stripped of his remaining titles and exiled. And now his elder brother Charles could be quizzed by police as a witness over a cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of his charities.  Charles denies any knowledge of the affair and has offered to help cops but his errant son Harry could also be drawn into it as a witness. What a circus. The -year-old Queen should be preparing for her Platinum Jubilee, relaxed in the knowledge that she’s secured the monarchy for generations to come. Instead she’s struggling to stand alone and assure us she isn’t going anywhere. Because how could she possibly leave The Firm in such an awful mess  According to an Ipsos Mori poll last week, a fth of Brits believe we should abolish the monarchy. That figure increases to % among those aged  to  – although the poll was carried out last year, before the latest twists. Yet none of the young people I’ve spoken to recently are calling for abolition. They actually want the monarchy to survive…but onlythe next sovereign is King William V. So perhaps it’s time for Prince Charles to think the unthinkable and consider abdicating when he accedes to the throne. Because he CAN move asidehe chooses, to make way for his youthful and popular son. The future of the monarchy may depend on it.

Victims of severe side effects can apply for up to £, under the Vaccines Damage Payment Scheme.But while the Sunday Mirror can reveal  have applied since last March, solicitors say no money has been paid by a scheme they say is unfit for purpose. Critics say that the maximum sum has not changed in  years. Under % of claims are successful – fewer than  from , claims this century – as applicants have to prove a jab left them % disabled.  And the scheme does not cover , families whose loved ones died soon after having the vaccine. Sarah Moore, from law firm Hausfeld, is representing several families. She said: “The VDPS is over  years old and offers too little, too late, to too few people. The Government can and must do better. We are campaigning for a reformed scheme based on a simple, swt and accessible procedure.” Vikki Spit and her partner Zion, , had spent just one night apart in  years before he died from a brain haemorrhage at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary in May.He had the AstraZeneca jab two weeks earlier and suffered crippling headaches. Vikki, of Alston, Cumbria, has called for grieving families to be added to the scheme.She said: “Our loved ones are not collateral damage. I have been suffering depression, anxiety, PTSD, panic attacks, insomnia. I am not able to work.” A government spokesman said: “All vaccines have undergone robust clinical trials. “The VDPS provides additional support to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, been severely disabled due to receiving a government- recommended vaccine.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcMental healthPanic attacksInsomniaPoliticsCoronavirus vaccineSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The father of Nathan Hunt, who served in Afghanistan, said he was touched to receive the letter from Her Majesty, which said she hoped the couple “find the strength to sustain you at this dficult time”. But the note added that the monarch cannot get involved in politics.Nathan’s dad Derek yesterday shared the letter with the Sunday People and said: “I think that the Queen would like to help but her hands have been tied.”Derek and his we Maria had turned to Her Majesty in their latest bid to have their son’s name added to the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Arboretum.Nathan was a serving Royal Engineers warrant officer when took his own le in January , aged .

Three other soldiers who took their own lives after serving in Afghanistan have been honoured on the Staffordshire memorial.Nathan served alongside the Queen’s grandson Prince Harry in . During a six-month tour, he cleared Taliban bombs and was praised for saving several comrades, including Harry. Last year, ex-soldier Derek, , and Maria, , from Lincoln, wrote to Harry – who ­replied expressing his dismay at not being able to help, having lost his military titles. The recent letter sent to Derek and Maria from a royal aide said: “The Queen hopes you and your we will continue to find the strength to sustain you at this dficult time.” Derek said: “I firmly believe Nathan took his own le because of the traumas he ­suffered in Afghanistan. He was mentally wounded. He was a casualty of war and should be recognised as such.” A report produced after Nathan died said he had experienced “traumatic exposure” in Afghanistan and had “elements of PTSD”.

And it marked the beginning of a remarkable “ Doctor Dolittle ” journey that has led her to literally talk to the animals – from chipmunks and guinea pigs to cows.She says she is able to translate their feelings and sort out problems. Lizzy, , also acts as a pet medium to reunite owners with their lost loved ones. And the mum of two even performs reiki sessions – a Japanese energy healing practice – for animals. Lizzy, from Dover, Kent, says she always knew she had “a gt”, but her spiritual ­awakening began in earnest when she tried reiki with a friend in .  She found the Japanese approach to ­relaxation – by placing gentle hands above the body – worked for her. Lizzy says: “I’d heard about reiki and how it’s good for your mental health. “Part of my brain was like, ‘This sounds like a load of tosh, the next big thing that’s going to be a scam’. But the other part of me was like, ‘What have you got to lose’ ” The session involved Lizzy lying on a massage table as a practitioner’s hands drew Japanese symbols in the air over her body to remove negative energy. Reiki is considered a pseudoscience – but Lizzy came away deeply moved and intrigued by the experience. And it wasn’t long into her online studies of reiki that she learned she could use the practice on animals as well as people. She’s since performed reiki – and even psychic readings – on a range of creatures. Which is where the horse comes in. Lizzy says: “I asked a couple of my friendsI could practise on their animals. The results that came back were amazing.” In one instance, a friend remarked that the horse Lizzy was treating had been much calmer with her than she had with a physio during an earlier appointment. Lizzy says: “I was listening to her and then all of a sudden I just heard in my mind, ‘Well you wouldn’t like ityou got touched there’. “I looked around and my friend was like, ‘Are you all right ’ “I said, ‘Yeah – I know this sounds daft, but did the physio touch her bum area ’ “My friend looked at me shocked and said, ‘Yeah – how did you know’   “I didn’t really know how to explain it. I was like, ‘Because she just told me’!” Realising she could hear the thoughts of animals, Lizzy says she is now contacted by owners from around the world eager to learn about their pets’ pasts. It can, she says, bring up painful experiences. Lizzy adds: “It can be quite tough because you feel that emotion and because you are connecting the owner and the animal as well, they might feel that emotion too.” Once, as she approached a horse with its owner, she says she heard it say: “Please don’t hurt me”. Lizzy says: “I looked at this woman and said, ‘Your horse was beaten before she came here, wasn’t she ’ “I was going through the session and she [the horse] showed me a man hitting her and how she was confined to a small space. It was just horrible for her.” Despite her professed powers, Lizzy never gives out medical advice and ­always encourages clients to see vets about health issues. But she does claim to offer a service no vet can – contacting an animal after it has died. For £, Lizzy will run an hour-long medium reading to get in touch with your passed-on pet. She asks for a photo of the animal then enters a state of meditation, calling the pet’s name for it to “come through”. The first time she tried, in , she was calling for a white Staffordshire bull terrier named Taya.  Lizzy says: “I just kept calling her name through and I had the image next to me so I could feel the energy from that. She came through. Even now it just makes my heart go. She was beautul and I will always be grateful that she was the first animal I ever reached out to. “She showed me running along this beach – all these memories – with a stick in her mouth and how much she enjoyed it.” Taya’s owner was overcome with emotion when she received Lizzy’s write-up of what she’d seen. It is a typical reaction from clients. Lizzy goes on: “The feedback I usually get afterwards is people saying, ‘Thank you so much for this’ – or they’ve noticed an energy around their house. “I did one last week and I connected with a cat that had passed over. I said to this young lady, ‘Your cat is around you, but you may not have noticed. I don’t know how he’s going to show you that he’s around you, but he’s telling me soon, and incredibly soon, that he’s going to show he’s there with you still’. “She messaged me yesterday and she sent me this little video of these orbs floating around. I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s like this little wispy light that comes off near their phone. She said: ‘I knew that was my cat – as soon as I saw it, I just knew.’ “I get so overwhelmed. Everybody, every person, every animal is new, and it’s exciting no matteryou do it  times or more.”  Lizzy’s remote reiki sessions cost £ – and it’s £ for an in-person session. Given what she does for a living, it’s no surprise that people have compared Lizzy to Dr Dolittle, author High Lofting’s fictional vet who could talk to animals. He penned the first in a series of Dolittle novels in  and a string of movies about the character have starred the likes of Eddie Murphy and, more recently, Robert Downey Jr. It’s a comparison Lizzy is completely wild about. She says: “I love Dr Dolittle, have done since I was a kid. “I’m completely obsessed with the Robert Downey Jr film. “Growing up, I was like, ‘How amazing would that be to speak to animals ’ Now obviously I can. “And my friends say ‘You’re a bit like Dr Dolittle aren’t you’ ”My grieving horseHorse lover Katie Ann Cock didn’t know anything about reiki when a friend recommended Lizzy to her. The -year-old from Sandwich, Kent – less than a -minute drive from where Lizzy lives – was worried about the welfare of her horse Liberty, after already losing one beloved horse named Apache. Katie says: “Lizzy picked up on that Lib was feeling very down and hurt and that something happened to make her feel this way. “She said she saw another horse. She described what this horse looked like – and it was a perfect description of my horse that had passed.” Katie says she found herself being drawn into the experience and felt “strong emotional feelings” during the session. She adds: “I could feel the warmth that Lizzy was giving me and Liberty and I got goosebumps and a little teary too, which she told me is completely normal. “She picked up on the fact that maybe a horse has passed and this is why Lib was feeling the way she was and the same for me as well.” Describing Lizzy’s finding as being “% correct”, Katie was amazed that she had picked up on Liberty’s grief. The experience had such a profound effect on Katie that she, just like Lizzy, has since been inspired to learn about the art of reiki healing. My homesick chipmunkWhen American pet lover Linda Mullins came across Lizzy doing a live video on Facebook, she saw an opportunity to get some answers about her chipmunk.Linda had found the striped rodent cold and alone while raking leaves at her home in Newburgh, New York. The retired food services worker, , says: “I commented, ‘I have this pet chipmunk and she has something wrong with her’. “At that time, we didn’t have a vet to take her to. “I’d had her about a year – now I’ve had her for two. Lizzy answered and said, ‘Yes I’ll do it now, I’ll seeI can get anything on the chipmunk’.” Linda duly sent Lizzy a picture of her pet, which she named Lady Chipmunk.  And she was flabbergasted by the reading that came back. Lizzy told Linda she believed there was a problem with Lady Chipmunk’s vision, which was true. She also offered insights into the creature’s feelings. Linda says: “She said Lady Chipmunk misses her family but she felt safe with me and she felt comfortable. “She knew that we weren’t going to hurt her and that we were trying to help her. “Lizzy said she saw her staying on a chair. I said, ‘That’s correct’. Lizzy is amazing. “I was like, ‘How can anybody even know this ’ “She’s truly gted. I knew at the time she wasn’t a fake when she said that.” My cow was an anxious mum Dairy farmer Zeta Bell tries not to get too attached to the cows she milks. But the -year-old always had a soft spot for one called Michaela. After being impressed with a reiki session Lizzy carried out on her horse named Wages, Zeta suggested she try communicating with Michaela. Zeta says: “I jokingly said, ‘I have a little pet calf that would be quite happy to talk to you’. “I thought it would be interesting to hear it from Michaela’s point of view. “With all the negativity around the dairy industry, I wanted to hear it from her to make sure that she was having a good experience. “Lizzy came back and said she [Michaela] had a few insecurities about the pregnancy side of things and she was worriedshe was doing a good enough job. It tugged at my little heartstrings.”Zeta admits that she had been sceptical about Lizzy initially. But after the session with Michaela, she was completely blown away. She says: “She was in calf – she would have been about a year-and-a-half old at the time. “She’s now coming up to two and she’s due to calve in the next couple of weeks. “I didn’t say anything like that to Lizzy – I didn’t even tell her her age. “It was amazing. I didn’t believe before, but I was like ‘wow’. There is no possible way she could have known that.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TherapyHorsesAnimalsCowsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This comes days after Andrew settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke of York denies all allegations made against him - claiming to have never met her. He paid her settlement worth a reported £million. She claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions by Epstein, claims he continues to deny even after paying the settlement.  It is believed Andrew marked his nd birthday at Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor. Since , when he stepped back from Royal duties, Andrew has not had the honour of having flags flown to mark his birthdays. Andrew has been given  days to settle the payment to Giuffre, but The Mail on Sunday has reported that the sale of his Swiss ski chalet is not yet available. They reported that he might require a short-term loan to settle his debt.  On top of this, there are questions about whether he can afford to pay the upkeep of Grade II listed Royal Lodge and meet the annual £, ‘peppercorn rent’. A source told The Sunday Mail said: “Parts of Royal Lodge really need updating and he obviously doesn’t have the money to make the repairs, so there are questions over whether he ought to be allowed to stay therehe can’t look after the place.” Prince Andrew is expected to attend a memorial service for his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, next month, but will not take any role in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.

At least four died in the UK and Ireland during one of the worst storms in decades, which saw gusts of winds of mph provisionally recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight.If veried, this would be the highest ever recorded in England.The Met Office has also warned that clean-up efforts could be set back by wet, windy weather moving in over the weekend. Some parts of the country could also see snow. Last night, nearly , properties had no electricity according to Energy Networks Associationand network providers recorded , disrupted customers for UK Power Networks, , for Scottish  Southern, , for Western Power, , for Northern Power and  for Electricity North West.The powerful storm has resulted in planes struggling to land in high winds, damage to the roof of the O arena in London, and the spire of St Thomas Church in Wells, Somerset, crashing to the ground. The Association of British Insurershas said previous similar storms have cost around £ million in repairs.  An ABI spokesperson said: It is too early to estimate the likely insured cost of Storm Eunice, when insurers will be focusing on assessing damage, and helping their customers recover.No two storms are the same. The last signicant storms to hit the UK - Ciara and Dennis - led to insurers paying out over £ million. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind covering the entire south coast and south-west Wales until pm on Saturday, and a yellow snow warning for parts of northern England from am until pm. On Sunday, a yellow warning for wind is in place for England, Wales, and south-west Scotland, while a yellow rain warning covers Lancashire and Cumbria.Meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said Eunice was one of the worst storms in decades. The mph statistic was a new provisional record for England in terms of wind gusts, he said. But itaposs also about how widespread the storm was, so we will be looking at whether this storm was worse than the Burns Night storm , or the one in  when gusts were around  to mph - but the damage may have been more widespread. Mr Dewhurst added that gusts reached mph at Heathrow, where planes struggled to land and thousands of people tuned in to watch on YouTube channel Big Jet TV, and mph in inner-city London. He warned travellers to brace for more windy weather in the coming days.Weaposll see gusts through the day of up to  to mph, particularly around the coasts, Mr Dewhurst said. This will have an impact on the clearing up process over the course of the day. We will see a slight easing in the wind over the evening time tonight but itaposs not long before they pick up again tomorrow to lead to another windy day across the UK.  Hundreds of journeys were cancelled on Friday as people were told to stay at home, and National Rail has warned there is still major disruption to services across most of Great Britain.

Covid deaths followed a similar trend, plateauing in the second half of January but dropping away throughout February.  This comes as Government ministers are set to decide this weekend how the UK will live with Covid moving forward. The decisions made will cover a number of signicant policy points which have defined how the nation’s dealt with Covid over the last few years. Free lateral flow tests are set to be scrapped, a move which could come within weeks.reported Ministers are split over whether to continue the impressive surveillance regime of the virus using the free tests or reign billions of pounds back by scrapping it entirely.  Advice could also change to schools and universities, and those with symptoms are set to no longer have access to free PCR tests, from sometime in March as well.In Boris Johnson’s final appearance in the House of Commons before the recess, he announced that the legal requirement for anyone with Covid to isolate will end a month earlier than previously expected.This means, from February , Brits who catch the virus could go out and about without any legal ramications.

Then Sunday sees the warning for wind and rain covering Scotland and northern England, while the alert for wind is still in place on Monday. Maps for WXCharts show that the mercury could drop to -C with up to nearly  inches of snow in Scotland on Saturday. The snow will also spread into northern England with several centimetres expected to land. Aidan McGivern of the Met Office said: Unfortunately, yet more wet and windy weather is expected this weekend, but not on the same scale as Storm Eunice.He continued: “Further showers come into Scotland, Northern Ireland and England, those falling as rain and sleet at lower levels, snow over the hills. And with temperatures dropping away, with lighter winds, with clearer spells there is a risk of a few icy patches.” A big clean-up is set to begin after Storm Eunice brought damage, disruption and record-breaking gusts of wind to the UK and Ireland, leading to the deaths of at least four people.  Millions of people were urged to stay at home on Friday due to safety fears over the impact of Eunice, one of the worst storms to hit the UK in a generation, while transport woes meant many were unable to travel. The windy conditions led to deaths and injuries in dferent parts of the country, along with travel disruption, flight cancellations, power cuts and police forces being inundated with calls. But the big clean-up could be hampered by the new yellow warnings in place. Train networks were disrupted with flying debris, while there was damage to buildings and homes.  A number of train operators extended warnings not to travel into Saturday. Winds of mph have been provisionally recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, which,veried, would be the highest ever recorded in England. The previous record was mph at Gwennap Head in Cornwall in . Footage shared online captured planes struggling to land in high winds, damage to the roof of the O arena in London, and the spire of St Thomas Church in Wells, Somerset, crashing to the ground.  On the transport network, several routes were closed. Wind speeds forced both the M Prince of Wales Bridge and M Severn Bridge into Wales to close to traffic for what is believed to be the first time in history, while the Humber Bridge linking Yorkshire and Lincolnshire closed from .pm. The A in Buxton was also closed on Friday afternoon after a lorry blew over, causing minor injuries. Train operators across Britain urged passengers to avoid travelling altogether, with no services operating in Wales for the entire day and seven train operators suspending all routes. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Further rain moving eastwards across many parts, perhaps turning to snow briefly over parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales, the north Midlands and Yorkshire, a slight cover possible. Turning windy again in south, with coastal gales. Chilly in north. Tonight: Some snow for a time across Scotland. Otherwise rain is expected, heavy in the north and west, patchy and light in the south and sheltered parts where. Turning milder. Sunday: Persistent rain for some northwestern areas, before heavy, squally rain sweeps southeast. This followed by brighter weather and showers, wintry in northwest. Further gales mild start, colder in northwest later. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Changeable and often windy, with spells of rain interspersed with sunny clear spells and showers, wintry at times in the north. Mild by day, although some colder nights with occasional frost.

She was always on call. “The inequalities of Edwardian le were staggering but Nellie lived in this extraordinary grey world – she experienced the le of the rich through travels with her lady.” By contrast, Julia Cavendish – just  herself – would have had a le much like that of the fictional Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the  movie based on the disaster.  On April , , Nellie travelled with the Cavendish family to Southampton to board the RMS Titanic. Their destination was Orienta Point in Mamarock , New York – home of Julia’s businessman father Henry Siegel. Nellie was travelling on their ticket, No, which cost £ and  shillings – equivalent to about £, today. Tony explains: “First class on the Titanic included a smoking room, a library, luxury piano lounge and a choice of fancy eateries. “If they came down to dinner they’d have had golden ploveron toast  “Nellie would not have got quite this luxury but she’d have had some pretty good food just down the corridor. “The Titanic was a microcosm of the Edwardian class system. “Right at the top of the boat was their first-class cabin while Nellie was in modest quarters nearby.” Four days after it set sail, at .pm on April , the liner hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic.  As Julia grabbed her jewellery and raced to the upper decks in panic, Nellie followed swtly behind. The crew quickly realised that with , passengers and just  leboats, many would perish. Women and children in first and second class were given priority – and Julia’s husband Tyrell put her and Nellie into one of the boats. But as Nellie was being lowered to safety, down in the depths of the ship, stoker Arthur John Priest faced a much bigger challenge. Says Tony: “Right at the bottom of the boat was Arthur, working in the engine room. “His job was to shovel a ton of coal every two minutes to keep the boat moving. Arthur and his mates were known as the ‘black gang’, always covered in soot and coal dust.”  Born in Southampton, Arthur was just a teenager when he went in search of a le on the ocean. Tony says: “It was back-breaking work in -degree heat just to keep the steam pressure kicking. “To keep him going, the White Star Line fed Arthur heartily – sausages, sometimes meat, potatoes, and beans… not to forget pudding. “It was maritime law that twice a week on foreign journeys, there had to be a stodgy plum pudding known as a plum duff on the menu. “After four hours feeding the fires, the boys were allowed just eight hours to sleep, eat and take part in leisure activities.” Arthur, , was on one of his rests between shts when the “unsinkable” ship hit the iceberg.  As he scrambled up a ladder in a service tunnel to the deck, he realised the vessel was fast filling with water. By the time he reached open air, all the leboats had gone. With no other choice, he jumped into the icy water. After  minutes, he was spotted and pulled aboard leboat . He had frostbite but was at least alive. Meanwhile, Nellie and Julia – on board leboat six – were picked up by RMS Carpathia, a cruise ship that had answered the Titanic’s distress signal. Nellie sent a Marconigram to her parents’ address, which informed them simply: “SAFE”. Dangerously over capacity, Carpathia arrived in New York on April  to be greeted by thousands.  There, Julia learned her husband had died. US immigration records show Nellie in good health on her arrival. She eventually ed with Julia to England, where they were reunited with Julia’s two sons. Nellie went on to work as a dressmaker. She never married, and her last address showed her living in Wandsworth, South West London, with her sister Edith. She died in London’s South Western Hospital in May , having outlived Julia by four months. For Arthur, the experience did not dim his love for the sea.  During the First World War he went on to survive three more sinkings – HMS Alcantara in , the hospital ship HMHS Britannicthe same year, and the SS Donegal, torpedoed in . He became known as “the unsinkable stoker” – but later claimed he had to retire because no one wanted to sail with him. He wed in  and he and his we Annie went on to have three sons. He lived out his last years back in Southampton, dying aged  in . Tony believes knowing the disaster could have been prevented is what feeds our ongoing obsession with it. He says: “They knew they were heading into icy waters but carried on. They believed it was unsinkable. “It’s incredible, all these years on, how fascinated we still are with the snapshot it gives us of Edwardian le.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Titanic sinkingTitanicTony RobinsonLeonardo DiCaprioKate WinsletWorld War ISunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When that’s settled, we’ll learn that Princess Anne has been identied as a safe-breaker in a gang that carried out a series of diamond heists in the East End of London. At first she was the getaway driver, but she arrived with a horse so all the others got caught. Documents will be found proving the Queen Mother spent the s breeding vicious corgis for dog fighting in the grounds of Balmoral. Then we’ll discover the reason we never see Prince Edward is because he spends all year dismantling the canons that fire the -gun salutes and sells them to North Korea. And Camilla runs an operation from Windsor Castle selling knocked-off transit vans, where she’s known as Cam the Slam for her habit of slamming anyone against the drawbridgethey’re late with their payments.  Prince Andrew’s next move will probably be to send out thousands of emails, saying: “Hello. I am British Prince with castle and a lot of MILLIONS of pounds!!

Some people have asked how he could have been in a Pizza Express without anyone seeing him there. So in court he’d have had the opportunity to explain that he also has a condition that makes him invisible. Or maybe he has a little torch that makes everybody forget what theyaposve seen like the agents in Men in Black. Whatever the reason, it’s a sign of his generosity that he would rather give away £m than have the chance to explain himself, which is what he wanted. He was adamant he’d never met the woman who accused him. So we should all follow Andrew’s example and pay £m to people who we’ve never met as this would provide an instant boost to the economy. It all proves what good value for money our royals are. People often defend the monarchy by saying “they bring in a lot of tourists”. And that’s true because people from around the world come here, saying: “We’ll be happy wandering round Barnsley shopping centre as long as we’re in the same country as the family of a prince who paid £m to a woman he can prove he never had sex with because he doesn’t sweat.” Theyaposre worth every penny.

The Swansea University student said the lump felt huge and that she started to worry when it didnapost develop into mumps. The -year-old said that she decided to have the lump checked out when she ed to Bath a few weeks later for the Christmas break. She told WalesOnline : I felt a lump in my neck, and I thought it was a bit strange, but we had mumps going round university halls, so I thought it was that. “The lump felt huge – probably just a little smaller than a golf ball. I sort of forgot about it but when it didn’t develop into mumps I started to worry. It was visible, andI looked up and swallowed in the mirror, I could see it moving up and down. Layla - who was  at the time - ed to her see her mum in Bath a few weeks later for the Christmas break, and her mum advised her that she should get the lump checked out. I booked an appointment with my GP, they were absolutely amazing, said Layla. I had a phone call with them, then the next day they had me come to the surgery, then referred me to hospital for an ultrasound and needle biopsy.Because the Covid- pandemic had started, I had to go by myself. It was a little strange, but I just had to get on with it.  The biopsy came back indeterminate and they couldn’t tell what was wrong with me. Biopsies are rated on a scale from one to five, with one being completely benign and five being definitely cancer, and mine was at a three.Layla was given the choice of having the lump removed and tested, which she chose to do, undergoing an operation in June, which also saw the left side of her thyroid removed. I had to go into hospital for the operation by myself as we were in the middle of the pandemic, she said. It was probably harder for my mum and dad that they couldn’t be there, and they felt so helpless. None of us had been through anything like this, and they just had to wait at home for me to call to say that the operation went ok, and I had woken up. The staff were all amazing though.But there was to be some shocking news to come for Layla and her family. She was diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, also known as thyroid cancer. “I was told it was a very slim chance it was cancer, and a call was scheduled to check in post-op, she said. I was recovering really well and was expecting positive news, it was a total shock. To be in your bedroom at home and find out you have cancer on the phone is awful. “I went downstairs and told my mum, and she’d already guessed it was cancer from theof the phone call. She said, ‘let’s take some deep breaths’ and then I remember that because I had to isolate for two weeks before hospital, that we were very practical about it and went food shopping! “The doctor was so apologetic on the phone and overall, I think it was better that I got the news quickly, so my treatment could begin as soon as possible. It probably would have been easier for me to hear it face-to-face, but I appreciate the fact that they wanted me to start my treatment as soon as possible.  Laylaaposs contact details were passed onto Teenage Cancer Trustaposs youth support co-ordinator, Anna, who was able to give her extra support through texts, phone calls and Facetime sessions. “My medical team were amazing, but they were so busy, and I didn’t feel like I could ring them and ask random questions, said Layla. With Anna, I knew that I could call her at any time in the day and get a response. If she didn’t know the answer, she had better access to the people who would. “She got to know me a person and knew what was important to me.

I was in and out of hospital for four days and it would have really helped to have had someone with me. No matter how grown up you are, you still get nervous, she said.“Because I was radioactive, I had to stay in lead-lined room at the hospital on my own for -hours after my first treatment. It was absolutely bizarre – I was attending university lectures on Zoom in there!“After my last treatment they did a full body scan to seethe cancer had gone, but it was unclear, so they said to come back the next day and I went back to the house I share with my university friends. “I had to stay in my room on my own that night, nobody could come close to me as I was still slightly radioactive. I spent the night panicking that the cancer had spread – was it now in my head or my heart  I coped well during treatment so this was definitely my lowest point, I couldn’t cope with the uncertainty.The young student said her support network in Swansea during her period of illness was amazing. I chose to stay in Swansea rather than heading home for treatment because that’s where I was diagnosed and met the team who would support me, she said. My boyfriend and friends became like a little family – they took me appointments and picked me up. They probably know more about what’s happened to me than I did. “It definitely wasn’t the university experience I was expecting! But I’ve managed to keep up with my studies and when I graduate hope to do a Masters, and then become a child psychologist. In Easter of last year, Layla had a face-to-face appointment where she received news she had long been hoping for. They showed me the screen and told me there was no evidence of cancer left, she said. “Although it was an immediate relief to hear that - and easier to believe with the photos and a written ‘no evidence of cancer’ note, it definitely took a few days to fully sink in. “My favourite part of this whole journey was getting to tell all the people that I love that I was clear and healthy, and seeing their reactions a year on from my diagnosis was amazing after having to see their initial shock and worry.

Georgina Carson, , and her fiancé Freddy Quinn, , put down a five per cent deposit on an £, property in Wigan three years ago.Georgina said the couple saved around £, each month by ditching nights out and budgeting while living at home with their parents.The couple then spent between £, and £, renovating their home during lockdown before selling it on for £, - making them a £, profit, Manchester Evening News reports.Georgina believes other young people can do the same, but that many arenapost willing to make the sacrices needed to become a homeowner.  Georgina, who is now in the process of renovating and selling the coupleaposs second home, says: Itaposs all about priorities. “Whilst saving for our first house my partner and I were both earning just over £, a year, so not an extravagant wage. We put away savings every month and managed to save about £, per month between us. “When we got the keys, we moved into the house straight away and lived in it whilst we were renovating.  We didn’t even have a bed, we just had a mattress on the floor and were living very basic. We had to wait to get paid every month to buy things to renovate the house. So one month we’d do the tiling and another month we’d get all the paint to do the walls. This was all to save as much money as possible as that’s what you have to do.”Earlier this month, Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp sparked outrage when she suggested young people should give up their luxuriesthey want to own a home in this day and age.Kirstie claimed that although there are those that cannot afford to buy a home, others are not willing to make the sacrices - and Georgina agrees.I think this is true, a lot of people don’t make sacrices for what they really want, she said. A lot of young people don’t want to make these sacrices which, each to their own, butyou want something that much you would do what you could to get it. I still enjoyed myself whilst saving, I always liked to make sure I have money saved to go on weekends away or to go abroad and that’s just because I manage my money well not because I come from a wealthy background.  In response to Kirstie claiming young people should give up aposcoffee, gym memberships and Netflix aposthey want to get on the property ladder, Georgina said: Giving up things like Netflix and coffee won’t give you the money for a house but it does help to save all that extra bit of cash you can.Maybe cut down on how many coffees you buy a week or think aboutyou really need subscriptions to Netflix etc. Both Georgina and fiancé Freddy lived with their parents while saving up for their first house - something which Kirstie advised - but not everybody is in a position to do. Georgina said although this helped, it wasnapost the main factor that allowed them to save.  “Whilst living with my parents I still paid rent, probably just not as much as I would haveI moved out, she explained. We’re not big drinkers so we didn’t go out every weekend and I only bought clothes for occasions orI needed them, so that helped us to save. We just prioritised and made sure that the money we were spending was just on things that we needed. I think young people rush to move out so young, and then use most of their wages on rent. For some people that might work but then you are stuck in a trap of paying rent from a young age, which then makes it harder to save for a deposit for a house. I think it does help to try and stay at home with parentsyou can, just so you can get yourself on track and save up a bit more money instead of moving out at .

I still enjoyed myself whilst saving, I always liked to make sure I have money saved to go on weekends away or to go abroad and that’s just because I manage my money well not because I come from a wealthy background. Kirstie advised that first-time buyers should find homes up north in cheaper areas to afford their lestyles while saving for a deposit on a home.  Georgina agreed: House prices in the north are a lot more affordable. I am on my second house that I have bought but I wouldn’t be in this positionI lived in the south. You can make money from houses in the north to put towards a house more down south - I think it is more about knowing the property market and how to make money with it. Georgina and Freddyaposs house was aposliveableapos but quite old fashioned when they bought it, and in need of modernising. The pair renovated everything themselves from painting to tiling the kitchen and bathroom, and they learnt their DIY tricks from YouTube and podcasts. “Before we both met we had it in our heads that we wanted to buy a house and rent it out, Georgina said. We both listened to podcasts and watched YouTube videos to learn everything about the home-buying and renovating process.

Twycross Zoo, in Leicestershire, has apologised and launched an internal investigation after a customer drew attention to the sign this week,LeicestershireLive reported . During a half-term trip to the popular attraction, one mum from Loughborough spotted the sign which read ‘Bongoland’ - a racist term used to refer to offensive stereotypes about colonial Africa.The sign was attached to a product of cuddly magnetic monkey toys made by Nature Planet - a company which supports a leading conservation organisation. The mum said: “It surprised me to see it was there. “It’s not something I’d expect to see in a zoo, especially when they are places of learning.  “I was just taken aback by how the sign was there and no one had picked up on the word.” She reported the matter to Twycross bosses on social media after ing home from her visit, receiving a public apology and an assurance an investigation would be carried out. She added: “I felt like I had to raise the matter and social media can be of great use in raising issues like this. “I wasn’t going on a crusade. I had my kids with me at the time and it was easier to report it later.” Her tweet about the sign drew a similar shocked reaction from fellow users, but the mum said she believed the sign wasn’t put up intentionally to cause offence. “I don’t think for one minute Twycross wanted to put up a sign with that word in it. It’s clearly related to a product, but someone should have looked and said ‘hang on, that’s not right’,” she continued.  “It’s clearly an oversight, but the zoo needs to be aware of what itaposs saying to people and the social history such a word can have.” In a statement, Twycross Zoo confirmed that the sign had been quickly taken down following the visitoraposs report. A zoo spokesman said: The supplier is one of many we work with, specically chosen for their support of Save the Orangutan – an essential conservation organisation who fight for the survival of the mighty, yet critically endangered apes while replanting trees in rainforests. “Twycross Zoo immediately removed the signage when it was brought to our attention by a Twitter user.”Twycross said reviews will now take place following the incident. “We are in the process of undertaking a full review of all product lines in our gt shop,” continued the spokesman. “We have also contacted Nature Planet about the feedback, requesting they undertake their own review and specically that the product range is re-named.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Half TermZoosAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Andrea Moser had always thought the flat brown mark above her lip was just a beauty mark – but in January , she realised it appeared to be growing in size, getting darker and looked irregular in shape. The -year-old decided to have a routine check-up that month and asked her GP about it, who she claims told her it looked like a normal mole and not to worry.However, the mum, from Montana, US, then saw someone on Instagram who was having an annual skin check and thought she should get checked as well due to her pale complexion. She went to the dermatologist that same month and they found areas of concern straight away - including the mark above her lip.They took a biopsy and found a spot on her back was squamous cell skin cancer and, at the time, they believed the mark on her lip was currently at a pre-cancerous stage.“When they told me I had a few spots but they didn’t think it was cancerous, I was just so glad that I had gone in,” Andrea, an estate agent, said. “Being fair skinned, it was always in the back of my mind that it could be a possibility. “My mum was pretty worried because she has had some spots removed as well.”While Andrea was concerned, she was relieved that the spots were a more common form of cancer which could be treated thanks to her insistence at getting checked out. In March , she underwent a procedure to remove the spot on her back and the mole above her lip – with doctors needing to make a large incision to cover the area surrounding the mole.She said: “They essentially burned [the hole on my back] off and it scabbed up. “But they wanted to make sure they got the entire spot above my le so that was more invasive. “They had to cut the entire mole out and make a large incision along my smile line to pull the skin back up and make sure it didn’t look like I had a hole above my lip. “I didn’t know how big it would be going into it, but thankfully I had an amazing surgeon who did a wonderful job.”After removal, the mole was tested and found to be melanoma – a serious form of skin cancer. Andrea said: “I was a little shocked – I always thought that would never happen to me.” Luckily, doctors were confident they had removed the entire mole and that the melanoma had not spread. Andrea said: “After the surgery it was hard to get used to the big incision but thankfully it has healed much better than I expected over the last  months. “My smile is a little dferent now but also a reminder that I was able to overcome this and the melanoma didnapost win!”Andrea has since been for three-monthly check-ups, which have all been clear, but she is more diligent than ever when it comes to her skin. She added: “I use a mineral based SPF lotion everyday now – even in the winter – and have totally changed my skin care routine.” Looking back on old pictures of herself, the spot can be seen steadily growing in size from as far back as .

Thousands of people liked the post, with users commenting that they would be getting checked as a result. One person said: “Thank you for sharing this post. After some other procedure I’m getting done, I’m going to get a spot checked on my face. It looks a lot like the picture.” “So happy you captured it all without it spreading. I too am a melanoma survivor and am very conscious now. Sending hugs,” another user commented.  Someone  said: “Thank you for showing the before spot. I always want to see these because some are not the typical images you see online. I’m glad you’re doing well and your scar is barely noticeable. Nice job.” Another user called it a “great reminder”. Andrea said: “This was a wake-up call for me as to how important it is to get checked regularly and wear sun protection. “I spent a lot of years not caring about it and I was hoping by sharing it would help other people to get checked before itaposs too late. “I heard lots of stories from people that decided to get checked so that made me happy.

When Kate LaValley, , opened up to her husband, Brad, , in  about her bisexuality, his encouragement to go out and explore dferent avenues unlocked the door to polyamory for both of them. Kate and Brad had been together for  years when in  they met married couple Alex and Lexi Kraft,  and , at a local bar where they both worked. Brad soon began a romantic relationship with Lexi and encouraged her husband Alex to peruse a relationship with Kate.  Now the two happy couples engage in spouse swapping every week and say it has been the key to their happy marriages - but have stated they are not swingers, but are in committed polyamorous relationships. Kate, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said: Polyamory has helped intensy the love I have for my partners, along with the amount of love and care.Our relationships together are very much like a family structure.We have a aposkitchen tableapos type polyamory, which means we can all sit and have a meal together at the table and play board games. Thereaposs no tension, all love and support between all of us.We have switch nights and sleepover dates, which started at the beginning of COVID. Once a week where we switch spouses and houses. Lexi will come here and have her night with Brad, and I will go to their house and have my date night with Alex.Many weekends we will have a brunch together in the morning after switch night and weaposre all in the kitchen cooking, eating and laughing together. Alex and I have our date nights we go out when we can, but when we have the baby, we stay in, and order take-out. Weaposve all gone out altogether but once you have three kids between you that can be quite dficult to wrangle babysitters.  Lexi and I are Metamours, which is a partneraposs partner.We have really good relationship, weaposre close friends, itaposs fairly platonic and we joke that weaposre sister wives. We watch each otheraposs kids and borrow each otheraposs clothes and Tupperware. The loved-up foursome help babysit Brad and Kateaposs two sons and Lexi and Alexaposs one child when the couple decides to go on inidual dates.Unlike Alex and Lexi who have been polyamorous since the beginning of their relationship, Kate and Brad began to explore polyamory later in the married le, with Brad encouraging Kate to explore her sexuality. Kate said: This wasnapost something that happened overnight, there were a lot of conversations. At that point, we had a lot of uncomfortable conversations, we had been married for a very long time and it was either, do we want to grow together or do we want to grow apart. For us, it has always been that we want to grow together. I realised later in le that I was bisexual, and Brad was always encouraged that I explore that as we did get married very young.  That was something that I hadnapost been able to do for myself. I was so shy and socially awkward and didnapost really knowI could do it. I realised I had the ability to love two people at the same time and it didnapost detract from anything from my husband or my marriage. I told him thathe wanted to go out and meet somebody he can. I was really enjoying myself and growing and I really wanted that for him too. I said thathe wanted to go out and see a woman, I was ok with that. He didnapost want to at first, but I really encouraged him and eventually said heaposd give it a try. Kateaposs boyfriend Alex said: Polyamory has allowed me to embrace compersion. Compersion is often defined as the opposite of jealousy, it is deriving pleasure from others joy.Itaposs an emotion that requires training, you have to learn it where jealousy is taught on a societal level. It is a requirement in consensually non-monogamous relationships and connects partners on a more deeply intimate level. Replacing jealousy with compersion is the single greatest act of intimacy one can share with a partner. Kate recently took to TikTok to share her polyamorous le and squash stereotypes and misconceptions, however, has had to hit back at haters who say they are cheating and are swingers. She said: I get askedweaposre swingers. I have to tell them that theyaposre totally dferent things, swinging is purely a sexual relationship where weaposre in romantic relationships dating our partners. With polyamory, sex doesnapost even have to enter the equation, even asexual people can be polyamorous.  With some people, things are just so black and white, and I think itaposs hard for people to even consider this for a moment.Ethical non-monogamy, or ENM, is an umbrella term, polyamory, open relationships and swingers are all types of ENM.There is a term within polyamory called polyfidelity in which a group of people agrees to be sexually exclusive with each other and not have lovers outside of the group but we are not a closed group.Alex has other partners, itaposs more of a semi-quad.There are just a lot of bad misconceptions, another comment is that my husband is a cuck or that weaposre cheating and weaposre not.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageSexualityRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

No one, ever, will question Mauricio dos Anjosapos commitment to his beloved Flamengo as heaposs always wearing their shirt. Mauricio, from Brazil, had to endure regular trips to the tattoo studio over the course of the year to get his inking finished, as the Daily Star reports. In total, it took him  painful sessions and a total of  hours to get the artwork finished - but luckily it didnapost cost anything as the tattooist did it for exposure. What do you think to Mauricioaposs incredible tattoo  Let us know in the comments...Mauricio explained his decision: I always wanted to have a Flamengo tattoo, ever since I became a fan as a child. I got a vulture [the team mascot] with the Flamengo shield on my biceps. Last year, I decided to get a tattoo of the jersey, which is something Iaposd actually been wanting to get for a while. But I thought it would be too expensive - between R,and R, . So I chose to get something smaller, that covered only part of my shoulder and chest. The tattoo artist asked for R , but as we chatted he told me heaposd do the entire jersey at no extra cost, just for the exposure. Mauricio has insisted that he has no regrets following his decision, and the Brazilian will never have to fork out around £ for another Flamengo shirt ever again.

Posting on Mumsnet, the woman revealed sheaposs been thinking about calling her son Thomas, but worries thathe goes by Tom for short that people will bully him because of the range of nicknames available to go along with the name.

But the mum-to-be was quickly reassured by Mumsnet posters that there was nothing to be worried about when it comes to the name, as most people donapost associate Tom or Thomas with anything negative. One person wrote: Tom is a lovely name! I’ve known a few of dferent ages. I never think of those things you mentioned!  While another said: Youaposre overthinking it. There are a lot of Tom words, Iaposd imagine because it has been a very popular name for hundreds of years. I know Tom is in a lot of nursery rhymes, for example. And a third posted: Youaposre definitely overthinking it, Tom is really nice on itaposs own but Iaposm not really a fan of Thomas. However, there were a few commenters who said theyaposve also been put off the name - though most claimed it was because of how common the moniker is. Someone said: The only thing that would put me off is how many there are. My daughteraposs boyfriend, my close friendaposs husband, and two of my close work colleagues are called Tom, and I regularly have to use last initials to dferentiate between them. As someone  added: All the Tomaposs that Iaposve met have put me off the name. The mum-to-be later ed to the post to thank those who commented to reassure her. She wrote: Thank you, everyone!

But one mum on TikTok has discovered that not everything looks as good in real le as it does in the pictures after she snapped up a winter coat that was modelled by former Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague, who is also the Creative Director of the retailer. Holly Smith shared a video that showed pictures of the long Teddy coat worn by Molly-Mae, the Daily Star reports, before she cut to a picture of herself wearing the oversized fluffy jacket - which looked more like a cosy dressing gown than a stylish outdoor coat. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The mum-of-four and money-saving blogger, who posts under the username @hollyvlogsofficial, captioned the clip: No wonder it was reduced...Holly also took to the comments of her video to ask people for their opinions, as she said that while the jacket was very comfortable, she doesnapost think sheaposll be wearing it outside any time soon. She added: Coat or Dressing Gown  Let me know what you think  …Opinion was split among the , people who viewed the viral video though - with many people defending the coat and insisting it wasnapost as bad as Holly first thought.One person said: Are you joking  This was my favourite coat for a good two years! While another added: It’s definitely a coat. Belted fluffy coats do look like dressing gowns, but what do you expect  And a third posted: I think it’s just the way it fits. If you bought a bigger size so it was oversized and didnapost do the belt up, it would look less like a dressing gown. But other commenters agreed with Holly, claiming the coat definitely seemed like something you would wear to keep you warm around the house in the winter months, rather than something suitable for the outdoors. Someone said: Itaposs nice, but it does look like a dressing gown. As someone  stated: I saw a similar jacket and literally my first thought was she was wearing a robe. In another video, Holly went into more detail about her ordeal with the PrettyLittleThing coat, as she said she had worn it out in public and had someone stop her to tell her not to feel bad about wearing a dressing gown in public. She said: PrettyLittleThing, you have done me dirty. This is what I wanted, the nice Teddy coat as seen on Molly-Mae, but this is what I got.

The -year-old says how she and her three siblings, who are aged ,  and , are always expected to buy gts for their mum on their own birthdays, as well as their siblingsapos, to celebrate the fact their mum gave birth. Every year on every single one of our birthday, weaposre expected to celebrate my mom as well. Weaposve done it since we were little. It was taught to me as aposgiving thanks for carrying and giving birth to us,apos which Iaposm all for, I am grateful as we wouldnapost be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.Every year on our birthday our mom gets gts too. As we got older, weaposre now expected to get her monetary gts . Just recently was my birthday and I was gted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook.  The womanaposs siblings all bought their mum gts too, and this year her -year-old sister pulled her aside to apologise for not being able to buy much as sheaposd spent all her money on an expensive necklace for her their mum, which sheaposd been dropping hints about for months. My sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciatedshe didnapost get it. I asked how much it was, and my sister said it was . I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gts after me, she continued. I think sheaposs ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gt! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom wonapost answer calls but my aunt momaposs sister called and said I was a piece of s*** for not respecting my mother and that Iaposm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gts mom got.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. At first the woman was convinced she was in the right, but since then sheaposs started questioning things as her mum hasnapost ed her calls for two weeks now,Sheaposs been posting on Facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your le, how blood doesnapost equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members - aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins - are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter, she continued.The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether others felt she was justied in kicking off at her mum, and she was met with resounding support. It was her choice to carry four children and give birth to them. Your mother sounds self-centred and selfish, one user commented. As far as toxicity in oneaposs le and how blood doesnapost equal family, I think you should apply that to your mother, not to you. Another agreed: Iaposve never in my le heard of such a ridiculous thing as gts for the mother or father for a kids birthday. That is some narcissistic nonsense.

One woman on TikTok who knows that feeling all too well is Rowie Kiel, from Australia, who was recently left disappointed when she asked her nail technician for red French tips but got something completely dferent.Rowie shared a video in which she walked through her nail bar visit and pointed out the ious red flags that she should have spotted along the way - but at the time she was too busy trusting the process to pick up on them. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She explained: Oh my god, you guys. So I got my nails done today. This is my nails before, and this is what I wanted, and yes - I do bite my nails. This was the first red flag. The colour was pink but I thought that after a few coats it might be red.The woman - who posts under the username @rowiekiel - then detailed how her technician got the colour onto the nails, which set off more alarm bells in her head as she thought he would just delicately paint the colour onto the tip.She added: I didnapost know this because I donapost usually get tips, I usually just go full colour, but look at what they do! Did anyone  know that  They literally just dip the nail into the colour.This is me trying to trust the process, but there is no comeback from this. No coming back. Rowie didnapost even have the style of nail she asked for, as although she wanted SNS - which is a type of dip powder manicure - she received acrylic nails, and was left unhappy with the results. Revealing what her nails looked like at the end of the process, she said: He told me to put my nails in the setter and I didnapost even want acrylics. I asked for SNS, but he talked me into getting acrylics - and look how f***ing disgusting they are. How embarrassing! Theyaposve got bubbles in them. Okay, theyaposre not disgusting, but theyaposre not what I asked for and itaposs nothing like the photo. F**k my le. And people in the comments of Rowieaposs video sympathised with her, as one even branded her nails horrendous and said they would have criedit had happened to them. They said: Oh my god, theyaposre horrendous. Iaposm so sorry. Itaposs okay, theyaposre only a short term problem. I wouldaposve cried though. While another added: Oh no, you poor thing! And a third wrote: Okay, theyaposre pretty bad.

The woman said she is glad he was in prisonJean-Luc Brunel with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein Image: pixelByPatrick HillNews Reporter:,  Feb Prince Andrew’s sex accuser Virginia Giuffre tonight said she was “disappointed” by the death of a model agency boss she said abused her. Jean-Luc Brunel, , who was on ­remand in Paris over alleged attacks on Ms Giuffre, was found dead in his cell in La Santé jail this morning. He was a friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. On Twitter, Ms Giuffre wrote: “The suicide of Jean-Luc Brunel, who abused me and countless girls and young women, ends another chapter. “I’m disappointed I wasn’t able to face him in a trial to hold him accountable, but gratied that I was able to testy in person last year to keep him in prison.”  The discovery of Brunel’s body came just days ­after Ms Giuffre, , agreed a court settlement with Andrew over claims he abused her three times when she was . The settlement is believed to be worth £million. Andrew denies any wrongdoing. A prison source told the Sunday People a night patrol found Brunel’s “leless body at about am”. They added: “It is suspected he ­committed suicide by hanging.” His death has eerie echoes of that of Epstein, who was found hanging in a New York cell in  while awaiting trial for numerous sex crimes.  It is likely to provoke conspiracy theories Brunel may have been killed to stop him implicating high-profile abusers. Ms Giuffre alleged Brunel had “sexual relations” with her “several” times” when she was aged  and . She also accused him of procuring “more than , women” and girls for Epstein. Other members of Epstein’s ring ­include British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, , who was found guilty of sex trafficking last month. Maxwell’s brother Ian said Brunel’s death had left him “fearing for her safety” at the politan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, where she is being held. He said: “Another death by hanging in a high-security prison… my reaction is total shock and bewilderment.” Mr Maxwell, who insisted his sister is not suicidal, added: “She was deemed a suicide risk and they are waking her every  minutes.  “It’s a complete violation of prisoner rights and human rights.” Brunel was indicted after two days of interviews by specialist police from an anti-paedophile unit in December . He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport while trying to fly to Senegal. A French judicial enquiry into his conduct had been opened in August , when prosecutors heard allegations he abused Ms Giuffre.  Brunel, who founded model agency MC, was also suspected of using his contacts in the fashion industry to procure girls for Epstein and his friends. At least four alleged victims accused him of sex abuse. He also faced allegations of rape and sexual harassment.It was claimed that on one occasion, he flew three -year-old sisters froma Paris estate to America as “a birthday gt” for disgraced financier Epstein, with whom Brunel also founded a US model management company.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkCharles de GaullePrisonsRoyal FamilyHuman rightsCrimeSunday PeopleJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A night patrol found his leless body at about am, said an investigating source. A judicial enquiry has been launched, and early evidence points to suicide. It was in December  that Brunel was indicted after two days of interviews by an examining magistrate and specialist police from an anti-paedophilia unit.  He was arrested at the city’s Charles de Gaulle airport while trying to board a plane to Dakar, Senegal, telling detectives I’m going on holiday. Brunel was suspected of having been part of a global underage sex ring organised by late American multi-billionaire paedophile Epstein, who took his own le in , while awaiting trial for numerous sex crimes. Others involved in the ring include Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, , who is currently in prison in the US after being found guilty of sex trafficking.A French judicial enquiry into Brunel’s conduct was opened in August , when prosecutors heard allegations that Brunel and the Queen’s second son shared a lover. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an American, has told lawyers she was employed as a ‘sex slave’ when she was forced to sleep with the Duke after being trafficked to him at least three times when she was  and . Prince Andrew has since agreed a civil settlement with Ms Giuffre, thought to be worth some £million.  Ms Roberts Giuffre has also said she had sexual relations with Brunel on several occasions, between the ages of  and , according to legal papers filed in America and France. Both Prince Andrew and Brunel vehemently deny these claims, with the Prince considered a key witness who both the Americans and the French want to interview in person. The rape of a minor is punishable by up to  years in prison in France, while aggravated sexual harassment comes with a three-year prison sentence and a fine equivalent to around £,.  Brunel, who denied any wrongdoing, was being held in custody until a criminal trial on a date to be fixed. Brunel was also suspected of using his contacts in the fashion industry to provide victims to Epstein and his friends. He is said to have flown three sisters from a Paris housing estate to America so they could be abused by Epstein as a birthday present.  Epstein – an old friend and business associate of Brunel’s – died in his prison cell in New York on August , , while awaiting trial for a range of offences, including trafficking minors for sex, and multiple rapes. Among his alleged victims, it is claimed in court documents, were the -year-old triplets from Paris. Brunel was the founder of MC, the model agency – one that prosecutors believe was used as a cover for Epstein’s sex trafficking ring.

Despite severe weather warnings, the storm seemed calm to the trio, who boarded their .am Ryanair flight on time. But as they made their descent into the midlands of the UK, their hopeful outlook began to change.Writing a piece for DublinLive, journalist, Cormac, said: The take-off was rocky, but nothing too frightening, and once we were up over the clouds it all seemed fine. It’s only  minutes to Birmingham and it felt like less when the pilot alerted the cabin that we were making our descent. It gradually became rocky as we started to come beneath the clouds, the plane bouncing from side to side rather violently. Many were visibly nervous, a two-year-old sitting near me, who was aposon her second-ever flightapos according to her Mam, excitedly looked out the window and remarked it was aposvery wibbly wobblyapos. The pilot aborted the landing and informed us we’d circle around a try again. After a few minutes circling the sky, it was clear the plane was lting higher and maybe we’d be heading somewhere .  Cormac and his flying buddies thought the plane may ert to Manchester or Liverpool instead. But when the pilot revealed they were headed for Prestwick, Glasgow, instead, it took some time for them to realise they were landing in a completely dferent country. Cormac said: It’s fair to say not many people know where that is, I and the passengers around me certainly didn’t, it soon became clear it’s in Glasgow - literally a dferent country. After they touched down on Scottish soil, the pilot gave passengers the chance to wait to seethey couldto Birmingham by air or disembark and take a replacement bus. Ryanair would provide the alternative transport, but warned the journey would take eight or nine hours, according to Cormac.  He said: Waiting seemed like the right option until the pilot informed passengers it was “very likely” the plane would head back to Dublin, with the chances of a Birminghamminimal. That saw a pretty mass exodus as people headed out to wait for this Ryanair provided bus. But after a two-hour wait for their replacement bus, Cormac and friends were crestfallen to learn that the flight had eventually landed in Birmingham despite the pessimistic forecasts. He said: Over two hours later [the bus] finally arrived and tired passengers filtered on, with a five-hour journey ahead of us. It was at this time someone spotted that our flight had just landed back in Birmingham, making the trip that bit more depressing - especially given the outlook the pilot gave as we disembarked. Ryanair offered their apologies by text and email for something, that in their defence, was not within their control.

The exercises are being undertaken by Kremlin nuclear missile forces and come amid a series of military training sessions which the West fears are being used as a precursor for an invasion.If Moscow sends troops into Ukraine there is major concern it could spark one of the worst conflicts since the Cold War. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to uncoil and move closer to the border with its former Soviet neighbour. We hope he steps back from the brink of conflict, he told a news conference on a visit to Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.  Russia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO stop Ukraine ever joining the alliance but says predictions it is planning to invade Ukraine are wrong and dangerous. It says it is now pulling back while Washington and allies insist the build-up is mounting. Russian-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine earlier declared a full military mobilisation, a day after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces.  Kyiv flatly denied the accusation and both it and Washington say increased shelling across the ceasefire line this week is part of Russiaaposs plan to create a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. Moscow said on Saturday a Ukrainian shell had exploded inside Russia and Russian news agencies later cited an unnamed source reporting a second. Multiple explosions could be heard on Saturday morning in the north of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, as more people got on buses to leave, a Reuters witness said. The origin was not immediately clear. Ukraine said earlier that one of its soldiers had been killed. Itaposs really scary. Iaposve taken everything I could carry, said Tatyana, , who was boarding a bus with her four-year-old daughter. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has given regular warnings of an impending invasion, said on Friday he now believes the capital Kyiv would be targeted by Russia but that he does not think Putin is even remotely contemplating using nuclear weapons.Biden said Putin would invade in the coming days. As of this moment, I am convinced that he has made the decision, he told reporters. The Kremlin said Russia had successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea and land-based targets during the exercises by Russiaaposs nuclear forces. Putin sat observing the exercises on screens along with the president of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, from what the Kremlin described as a situation centre.  Austin said the nuclear exercises were stoking concern among defence leaders around the world given that Russiaaposs military was focused on a massive build-up of forces around Ukraine. When you layer on top of that a very sophisticated exercise with strategic nuclear forces, that makes things complicated to the degree that you could have an accident or a mistake, he said. The drills follow a huge series of manoeuvres by Russiaaposs armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops - estimated by the West to number , or more - to the north, east and south of Ukraine. Moscow-based analysts said the exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russiaaposs demands for security guarantees from NATO seriously after the allianceaposs expansion to Russiaaposs borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union in .  The signal to the West is not so much aposdonapost interfereapos, but instead designed to say that the problem is not Ukraine and actually much wider, Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the IMEMO RAS think tank, said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Saturday Russia knew that the alliance could not meet its demands, which include the withdrawal of NATO forces from former communist east European states that have elected to join NATO. New helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have deployed in Russia, near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies, which tracks developments with satellite imagery.  The Kremlin also has tens of thousands of troops staging exercises in Belarus, north of Ukraine, that are due to end on Sunday. Lukashenko said on Friday they could stay as long as needed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was set to meet U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Stoltenberg and other Western leaders at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday andthe same day amid fears Russia might try to engineer a coup. Moscow has dismissed the idea it has any such plan.  Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine in , the same year that Moscow annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine after protests toppled its pro-Russian leader. Kyiv says more than , people have since died in the conflict in the east. In one breakaway region, Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peopleaposs Republic, said he had signed a decree on mobilisation and called on men able to hold a weapon in their hands to come to military commissariats. The Luhansk Peopleaposs Republic issued a similar decree. Russian news agencies said on Saturday , evacuees had arrived so far in Russia. The separatist authorites say they aim to evacuate , people.  At a market in Donetsk, -year-old Oksana Feoktisova boarded an evacuation bus with her -year-old son and her mother. They were accompanied by Feoktisovaaposs brother Yuri who stayed behind in Donetsk. They donapost let men on, and I wouldnapost go anyway frankly, Yuri said. Iaposm a reservist in any case. Iaposm an artillery man by birth... Iaposm loyal to my state, to my people.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll youth bolsters oban rugby","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhile Mid Argyll under- rugby players took the field at Slockavullin on January  for their first match in two years # as reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser # three other Mid Argyll youngsters were playing that day, but  miles away in Oban.Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley and Rhys Coffield helped Oban Lorne to a  #  victory over Loch Lomond in the West Youth under- Cup.In the match, played at Glencruitten, Murray bagged a hat-trick of tries and, not content with simply crossing the whitewash, he banged over eight conversions.The next match for Mid Argyll under-s is away to Glasgow High Kelvinsideon Sunday February , followed by a home tie versus Whitecraigs on February  at Slockavullin.PICS:Lochgilphead inside centre Murray MacDonald es over the line to score for Oban Lorne in the under- match v Loch Lomond at Glencruitten.

We want to win. We know how they will play and we will set out our stall. The last time we played them Jimmy can remember the tactics that hm and Neil Hastings put forward and we will do something similar.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

was recently slated in the national press for refusing to sign the #Save Our Bands# petition.But this week he went a step further by writing stinging letters to both Dick Walsh, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, and Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for Scotland.The future of the band is in jeopardy because Argyll and Bute Council has a shortfall of funding this year of more than £ million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support to the local people who are fighting to protect the teaching of music in their schools and I will urge the council to reconsider any plans they may have to implement these catastrophic and far reaching measures.#FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown#s coal situation is worsening and now merchants have only one week#s supply left.The local firm of D McNair and Son announced earlier this week that it had only seven days# supply left, and it is rationing its regular customers to cwt per week.#Although,# said the company#s owner, Mr Donald Shaw, #we have also got a good supply of dross and coke and a fair supply of peat.#The SCWS is in exactly the same position it too will run out of coal in one week.The Scottish Gas Board has barely two-and-a-half weeks# coal supply, despite the fact that it has been using propane gas with the coal to stretch its supplies.#Unless more supplies are received after this period, all the gas will be off,# said a spokesman.As a result of the national strike, electricity cuts hit Campbeltown on Monday, bringing work at the Andrew Douglas clothing factory to a halt.The factory manager, Mr Harry Moffat, anticipating an early Monday morning power cut, called his employees to work on Saturday.#These cuts will definitely affect factory production, although I hope to get as many hours# work as possible between the cuts,# said Mr Moffat.A director of the local Golden Grain Bakery said that its production will also suffer because of the strike.#Every effort will be made to produce a full range of bakery products by switching daysht workers to night workcuts prevent day work,# he added.Campbeltown#s householders have also suffered great inconvenience due to the power cuts and this has resulted in a steady demand for candles in local shops.One of the most disappointing aspects of the power cut from the local teenagers# point of view was the cancellation of a dance on Monday evening.The dance was arranged specially for Valentine#s Day.SEVENTY YEARS AGOA strong deputation of  officials from the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotlandattended and conducted the ceremony of electing and installing the office bearers of the newly formed

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin internment, but below the average for a cremation.

beginning of April for about  million customers across the UK – from £, to £, – will see those on default tarfs paying by direct debit having to fork out an extra £ a year, while prepayment customers will see an increase of £ from £, to £,.The increase has been described as “absolutely devastating for households across Scotland” by Energy Action Scotland, which says it will force many to “choose between heating and eating”.The huge rise, which is being blamed on soaring global gas prices, is expected to see  per cent of households in East Lothian enter fuel poverty for the first time, while  per cent of households in the county are expected to be pushed into extreme fuel poverty as a result, according to the  local authority Scottish House Condition report.But residents who are struggling to make ends meet are being urged not to “suffer in silence”.Paul McLennan, East Lothian MSP, has vowed to do what he can to help people who find themselves in a challenging situation, while South Scotland MSPs Craig Hoy and Martin Whitfield have also urged those who need help to get in touch.: Energy price cap increase: UK households to pay £, from April after Ofgem announcementMr McLennan said: “One in three Scots already find bills unaffordable and almost half a million people across the country have had to sacrice food to deal with unaffordable bills – this is simply shameful.“My constituency team is on hand to help anyone who is worried about the upcoming energy price increase and can offer support in contacting your supplier, applying for Government grants, or signposting to consumer groups and charities who can help with calculating debts and understanding what your options are.“I know that many of these measures do not go far enough, but please do not suffer in silence as the energy cap increase comes into effect.“My team and I will do all that we can to help to prevent locals from making the choice between heating or eating.”Fellow MSP Mr Hoy also encouraged people to get in touch.He said: “It is deeply concerning that up to one in four East Lothian households are at risk of entering fuel poverty.“This is a global crisis and we must do all we can to support people at this hugely dficult time.“The UK Government and Rishi Sunak stepped up to provide extra funding to the Scottish Government and it is right that support was passed on in the form of council tax rebates.“However, the devil will be in the detail of who exactly will be eligible for these payments and we need to see that from SNP Ministers.“My team and I are keen to engage and happy to help any constituent who is struggling with recent increases in the cost of living.“Please do not hesitate to get in touch.”: Why is the UK suffering a cost-of-living squeeze and what action is being taken And fellow South Scotland MSP Mr Whitfield said: “The energy price cap rise is a devastating blow for thousands of local households, pushing many more into fuel poverty.“More must be done to support people, which is why Labour is calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas and a cut in VAT on energy prices to save Scottish households up to £, as well as targeted support for the hardest-hit with a £ Scottish Fuel Payment.“While the impact of rising bills will be deeply concerning for many, especially those on low or fixed incomes, it’s important to remember there is help available.“My staff and I can provide assistance, but East Lothian Council’s welfare rights service and local CABs, as well as national advice services, are also on hand to determinepeople are eligible for any additional funding.“As well as seeking to ensure households struggling with their bills get the help they need, I’ll also keep campaigning for further measures to support consumers and fix our broken energy market to help keep bills low in the future.”Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also expressed his concern over the price rise.He said: “Energy price rises, and at the level they’re coming in at, will hit many hard.“It’s absurd that East Lothian should see fuel poverty with a nuclear power station, wind energy set to flow ashore and Scotland energy sufficient in oil and gas. This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty Partnership set up by East Lothian Council is due to hold its first meeting next month, bringing together public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups to combine efforts to tackle poverty.”"},{"url":null,"title":"not-single-firm-defaults-emergency-loans-given-east-lothian-council-lockdown","story":"In a record described as \"remarkable\" by one councillor, East Lothian

This is unsurprising when one considers the novel’s popularity. It was nominated for the Booker Prize, and Ali was on Granta’s Best Young Novelists list before her book was even in print. Take from that what you will, but, in part, it was popular because it brought a hidden story into the light. It is about an uneducated virgin bride from Bangladesh who is sent to London for an arranged marriage. The novel showed another side of polyglot London: the Bangladeshi community some people previously knew about only through its food.Her subsequent novels were not received with quite as much gushing praise, such is the fickle nature of book-world. Alentejo Bluewas – mostly – set in Portugal, a bold and interesting decision which showed she was not to be pigeon-holed Into the Kitchenmoved back to Britain, and was based in a hotel restaurant Untold Storyfollowed a woman, remarkably like Diana Spencer, who fakes her own death and hides away in small-town America to escape the Royal Family. Since then, there has been a lull. Now a decade later, she has published Love Marriage, which comes in at just under  pages.The hidden le is also the subject of this novel. It is about two London families, the Ghoramis and the Sangsters. Joe Sangster and Yasmin Ghorami are young doctors, engaged to be married. They work at St. Barnabas hospital in London. Yasmin’s family are Muslim, but in the way that some Christians describe themselves as CofE. Her parents were both born in India. The father, Shaokat, is secular. When asked about his faith, he replies that his we, Anisah, “shoulders the burden of faith for the two of us”. Joe’s mother, Harriet, is a white feminist intellectual who lives on Primrose Hill – obviously – and seems to earn money solely from being a contrarian.We begin with a first meeting between the two families. Yasmin worries her family’s conservativism might be undermined in Harriet’s household. The opening sentence of the novel, for example, runs: “In the Ghorami household sex was never mentioned.” For Harriet, sex is something discussed with unabashed exuberance. So, “what would ensue , as had happened on Yasmin’s first visit to Primrose Hill, she [Harriet] insisted on showing off her collection of Indian erotica  Or started on one of her pet topics, such as the cultural signicance of pubic hair ”Ali uses this culture clash to write some great scenes. Shaokat, for instance, doesn’t understand English irony, whereby “affection could be expressed in insults”. Harriet is so desperate not to be seen as racist that she convinces Yasmin’s parents to hold an Islamic ceremony for the wedding, something no-one  has even considered. Harriet has her own motives of course: “I’m looking forward to seeing how many impeccable liberals of our acquaintance turn out to be Islamophobes.” From this point on,the marriage goes ahead, a baffled Joe will convert to Islam.After this, I looked forward to more farcical comedy. And there is more, scattered around, but from here the plot takes precedence. The story becomes a series of crises. Every family memberhas a le-changing secret. Joe – heretofore, charming, respectful, earnest – turns out to have a sex addiction. This would be worrying in itself, but, well, he’s a gynaecologist. He starts regular therapy sessions that unearth his unhealthy relationship with his mother. Yasmin becomes disenchanted with the NHS, and suspects that she is only a doctor out of fatherly loyalty. Harriet and Anisah become best friends and this, in turn, uncovers the strange foundation of Anisah’s marriage.I could go on like this, for pages. In a straightforward farce, this chaos would work, but Ali too often turns to sombre drama. A particular violent scene involving Shaokat and Ar has about it the atmosphere of a cheap soap opera Joe’s conversations with his therapist are too sincere for fiction. There’s a reason Philip Roth got away with so many psychotherapists in his novels he didn’t take them seriously.This aside, Ali is wonderful at depicting society’s social mores and obsessions. Take the example of causing offence, which nowadays is a crime equivalent to high treason. In one scene, a patient’s relative asks Yasmin to refer her to a “doctor qualied in Britain”. Yasmin asksshe means a white doctor in a sane world, Yasmin’s response would be entirely appropriate. Instead, NHS management instruct her to undergo “ersity awareness and sensitivity” training. She is also told to sign a letter of apology to the aggrieved woman. The logic of this is summed up by Joe: “Calling someone racist is worse than being racist ’”Racism – actual or imagined, and its dferent forms – is present everywhere. When a white novelist condescendingly calls a younger black novelist “boy”, he realises his mistake, but it’s too late. That one word conjures up a whole history of racial prejudice and white entitlement. It is not always as cut and dried as this. When at one point, Yasmin’s best friend hears about Harriet and Anisah’s friendship, she accuses Harriet of a more subtle prejudice: “exotication” and “Orientalism”. As is true in real le today, every conversation is a weighted one, with a nervy political subtext, a tension that something said will result in ostracism or outrage, that it will ruin lives.The atmosphere of the novel captures the zeitgeist, with its debates on identity politics, cultural appropriation, the legacy of Empire, competing histories, and sexual promiscuity. Ali, rather expertly, does not let this cloud the premise of her novel: can love, or marriage, survive without secrets and lies  When Ali is in the right tone, she’s a terric writer: the timing and political acuity of her comedy is spot-on. Elsewhere, she doesn’t have quite the same energy. Still, there is enough quality writing here to suggest that Love Marriage deserves to be just as popular as Brick Lane."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13484796.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kate-mosse-shares-natural-landscapes-inspire-writing","story":"KATE MOSSE, AUTHORWhere is it The Fishbourne Marshes, an area of outstanding national beauty within Chichester Harbour on the south coast of Sussex.From the waters edge, you can see the spire of Chichester Cathedral to the east and the tiny flint-faced church in Fishbourne, to the south the sailing boats at Dell Quay and the magnicent South Downsto the north.In the centre of the creek, the burnt-out remains of one of the oldest of the Fishbourne Mills can just be seen at low tide.Why do you go there For the shting landscape, for peace and quiet and solace, for the rugged wildness of the marshland, for the huge skies and views of the Downs in the distance, for the nesting seabirds and the rattle of the reedmace at high tide.Its a completely dferent place depending on the time of day and the season – menacing in the winter, gloriously gold in the autumn, a riot of wildflowers and crops in the spring and early summer.Author Kate Mosse.

People recently vaccinated in Scotland, on the other hand, will almost all still be living here.Separately, there is also evidence that vaccinated iniduals are more likely to get tested and, in particular, to self-report a positive lateral flow result - a bias which has become potentially more consequential recently.: Weird data shows Scotlands Covid case rates lowest in the unvaccinatedMeanwhile, Omicron also resulted in the hospitalisation rate among the double-vaccinated pulling ahead of the unvaccinated in December, for the first time, for dferent reasons.Omicron arrived just as second dose vaccination was waning. Those double-vaccinated iniduals ending up in hospital were overwhelmingly over  , and overdue for their booster.Hospital admission rates in the most recent week. Mortality and hospitalisation rates have remained consistently much lower in the boosted group throughout the Omicron wave The fact that these elderly people had not yet had a booster mostly reflects complex health issues and frailty, compared to unvaccinated and boosted people of the same age. Some will have been hospitalised for these pre-existing conditions only to contract Covid on the wards.\"We dont think its in the public interest really now to publish [the data] because its so misleading,\" one PHS official told the Herald.The tables will be published quarterly now, instead of weekly.Yet withdrawing the statistics in a bid to to prevent them becoming fodder for antivaxxers also has the effect, surely, of making them seem like some sort of embarrassing smoking gun to be hidden \"Im sure well get accused of a cover up,\" added the official.\"I am worried about that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-auctioneers-lead-sale-rare-18th-century-dolls-house","story":"With precise attention to detail, it is a dolls house which offers a unique insight into a period of time.Now this rare surviving mid-th century doll’s house is to go under the hammer at Lyon  Turnbull’s Edinburgh showroom next Thursday when bidding is due to start at £,.Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingThe Evans Baby House, part of the ‘Five Centuries: Furniture, Paintings  Works of Art’ auction is an amazing piece of social and cultural history showcasing th century interiors and tiny artefacts.The Baby House, an earlier term for what became known as a doll’s house, was first documented in a book by Vivien Greene in , reprinted in , in which she recounts the fascinating history of The Evans Baby House. Ms Green, a notable authority on English dolls’ houses of the th and th centuries, was also the we of novelist Graham Greene.  She wrote of this particular doll’s house: “This story of its recovery is in its miniature way as exciting and touching to read as any history of a real house bought back by its original owners after alienation…”  The house came into the ownership of the Evans family in Buckinghamshire in the early th century and was given to a female member, Anne, by a Miss Hancock,thought to be her godmother.Read more: Glasgow workplace parking fees could bring in £millionAnne Evans, an English poet and composer, and her sibling Emma, were sisters of archaeologist, geologist and collector, Sir John Evans.

Later additions include the children in the nursery and a male doll which Emma described as having ‘mutton-chop whiskers.’Emma is believed to have passed the doll’s house to her brother, Sir John, and through him by descent to his daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter, the late Mary Harley .

It is time for some to look beyond the present and contemplate the future, and realise that they must now desist from their present practices.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.* IT says much about the state of our politics that the allegations of abuse brought into focus by the BBCs Sarah Smith have been instantly weaponised by unionist politicians from the Scottish Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to condemn \"nationalism\".Its abundant from many a newspaper headline and the Twitter accounts of opposition MSPs and their parties that the bile, hatred and misogyny called out by Sarah Smith is also meted out on a daily basis to Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes, who thankfully appear to have a much thicker skin than journalists.In a healthier political climate, opposition politicians would make this balanced observation for the greater good, but their party lines and allegiances clearly negate this option.Alistair McBay, Perth.SORRY COMMENT ON THE NATIONSARAH Smith reveals that she is relieved to be out of Scotland and in the US after the abuse she received while BBC Scotland Editor. She named no names, but did mention being \"demonised quite heavily… amongst certain parts of the population\". This is a very sorry comment on the state that Scotland has developed into, especially since .Ms Smith was in the news during the pandemic for saying that Nicola Sturgeon was \"enjoying\" the extras powers she could exercise. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she was not enjoying the pandemic at all, and her hurt tones were taken as a signal by her nationalist followers to retaliate. They bombard Ms Smith with aggressive and insulting messages on social media. The better-educated among us know that \"enjoy\" has ious meanings, including \"possess\". That was lost on the social media warriors, and, apparently, on Ms Sturgeon herself.Ms Smith says that that was not a one-off, that she received \"vitriolic attention most of the time\". What kind of country has Scotland become that that it is now acceptable \"amongst certain parts of the population\"  The answer is: a nationalist one.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.PLAYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA GAMERESEARCH I conducted in a Clydeside engineering plantfor my doctoral thesis  years ago included asking respondents what newspapers, television news and current affairs programmes they read watched and whether they perceived any political slant in those read watched. With newspapers a political line was often observed, but television was identied as neutral. I wonderI would get the same answers today Of course, in the late s, consumption of media reports was largely passive, opportunities for the reader viewer to respond being limited to such as Points of View and Letters to the Editor. This though is no longer the case, with social media s such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the legion of bloggers, making passive consumption something media commentators can only look back on.For instance, Sarah Smith claims in a tweet to have tried “to be fair and impartial”, which she may well have considered herself to be, but part of her audience didn’t. And sometimes they had good reason, such as when she reported the annual figure for patients waiting four hours in AEas a weekly figure. Of course, mistakes get made, but how likely is that almost two per cent of the Scottish population were even in AE in a particular week, never mind having to wait more than four hours Of course, as in “the old days” a “correction” was made, though damage had been done at the time. Another instance is, though, more concerning, her claim that Nicola Sturgeon was “enjoying” the Covid pandemic. This was explained by Ms Smith on Twitter, that she meant to say “she [Ms Sturgeon] has embraced the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyed by mistake”. Perhaps, given that her error had started the whole process, an apology, prior to withdrawal, might have been more in order  But no, the political point just had to be made.Lastly, might I point out that Ms Smith, like many other journalists, some of whom make similar complaints, plays the social media “game”. As an experienced \"player\" did she really imagine that Thursday night’s tweet “Sharing this will no doubt invite all my *fans* on Twitter to take another shot” was going to be welcomed positively and warmly  Or did it get the reaction she wanted Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WATCH OUT FOR AMERICAI FOUND your report on Sarah Smith regarding bile, hatred and misogyny in Scottish politics an interesting read, but I do hope that she is not naive enough to believe that by relocating in America as the BBCs correspondent that she is entering a country that is bereft of the self-same problems she is leaving in Scotland.Our politics are not perfect by a long way. I wonder how long she will tolerate the ballyhoo and razzamatazz of America, before she s to our shores as a less naive person.Neil Stewart, Balfron.LACK OF BALANCE ON DEBATE NIGHTIT is disingenuous for any politician to echo the term “isive referendum” when the reason for holding a referendum is when opinion is clearly split on a signicant issue, such as Scotland’s constitutional future. What is more “isive” is when our self-proclaimed impartial public broadcaster fails to provide balance in its news and political programmes.With the resumption of BBC Scotland’s Debate Night the BBC has an opportunity to improve upon,not fully recty, the mistakes of the past, but instead on Wednesday night the public was subjected to the views of another predominantly anti-independence and another seemingly contrived pro-Union audience with a host in Stephen Jardine who still insists on interrupting SNP politicians while content to facilitate more propaganda from anti-independence advocates. Anas Sarwar of the Labour Party was repeatedly given free rein to voice his shallow sound-bites without being held to account by our intrepid host. When Pete Wishart of the SNP attempted toMr Sarwar to fundamental realities by stating the facts that only the UK Government could introduce a windfall tax and that this was not going to happen any time soon under the Tories, Mr Wishart’s contribution was abruptly curtailed by Mr Jardine.Perhapsthe BBC were to host serious and balanced debates on Scotland’s constitutional future any sense of “isiveness” might disappear as the Scottish public becomes convinced of the merits of self-determination, but perhaps this is why the BBC and anti-independence politicians will continue to deny the people of Scotland a truly impartial public broadcasting service and why a referendum, or constitutional change vote in the next General Election, is now a democratic necessity.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.REMEMBER CHERNOBYLDOUG Maughansays he has \"never understood the safety concerns about nuclear power\", to which I would reply succinctly: Chernobyl.I could expand by adding the fact that more than , people were forced to leave their homes in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and  years later, many districts of Norway were still having to test animals for radiation.More generally, there is no case for nuclear energy in Scotland – we are already creating so much energy from other, cheaper, renewable sources that it is simply unnecessary.David Patrick, Edinburgh.WINDS OF CHANGEI SEEM to recall a UK minister telling the people of the Highland that they did not deserve an enhanced cold weather  winter payment, because “they were used to the cold”. Now we have the BBC asserting mph winds are more serious in the south than in the north, because “Scotland has these high winds every winter”. That’ll be a relief to those in the north-east of Scotland and England who were without power for a week. I suspect any power outages in the south will be remedied long before a week is out – probably led by Boris Johnson with hard hat, and glib, exculpatoryexcuses.GR Weir, Ochiltree.EVERYTHING WITH CHIPSON the basis of a little of what you fancy does you good, I have no quibble with washing down my top gastronomic delight, fish and chips, with an infusion of camellia sinensis, , but I admit surprise at the omission of enhancing CHCOOH, .And good luck also to Embra devotees of their special brown “chippy sauce”.Live and let live.R Russell Smith, Largs.Read more: Why many in Scotland hold Nicola Sturgeon in contempt"},{"url":null,"title":"rory-darge-hopeful-return-six-nations-winning-ways-scotland-france","story":"The most signicant and encouraging aspect of their victory over England was precisely the fact it was achieved despite Scotland’s not being at the top of their game. They had the maturity and self-confidence to find a way to win even though they were not in absolutely optimal form.The most disheartening aspect of the loss to Wales which followed the Calcutta Cup triumph was the fact that it might so easily have been another victory. Again below their best other than during a first-half purple passage in which they went from - down to - up, Scotland still only lost by three points to a team that was totally fired up on home soil.The most concerning thing about the impending game against France  Surely the fact that France’s firepower is considerably greater than England’s or Wales’s.That means Scotland will not get away with playing well in parts, or with the lapses in discipline which cost them against the Welsh. Or, as Rory Darge put it, they will need to make every minor incident countthe big picture is going to end up in their favour.“It was massively disappointing that we lost to Wales,” said the Glasgow openside, who made his long-awaited debut off the bench in Cardf. “But we’ve still got three huge games left.“If you try and put it in perspective, we’ve won a really big game against England, then lost another game by a really small margin where we were disappointed with the performance and the result.“At this level, it’s about small moments and what impact that can have - the margins that it comes down to. We know what France will bring. Every moment is going to be massively important against them.”While this will be Darge’s first Test against the Championship favourites, he has seen some of the French side at first hand this season in Glasgow’s two Champions Cup games against La Rochelle. The Warriors took some time to cope with the physicality of their opponents in their first, away fixture, but ended up securing a losing bonus point. They then lost at home by eight points in a similar type of game, and Darge knows well that Scotland will have to ensure they do some of the things that the Warriors could not quite manage. “In terms of what we expect, it’ll be similar to what French teams bring as a whole,” he said as he looked ahead to what,he is selected, will be his first cap at BT Murrayfield. “La Rochelle have got a few players in their team who you would imagine will be playing for France - big men who run hard and try and get offloads away.”And will he be selected  One of the most commonly asked questions about Darge has been can he play in the same team as another out-and-out openside, his former Edinburgh team-mate Hamish Watson  Gregor Townsend answered that question in Cardf, bringing the Warriors player off the bench with Watson still on the pitch.If the head coach opts for a - split among his substitutes, that should make a second cap for the -year-old a stronger possibility. There is always a temptation to go for the greatest bulk against a side such as France, but such a strategy, by focusing on the negation of your opponents’ virtues, can be implemented at the expense of some of your own strengths. So, while Watson will almost certainly start at , giving Darge a place among the substitutes could ensure more competitiveness at the breakdown later in the game.And although at ft in Darge is far from the tallest forward in the Scotland squad, he believes there is greater iety to his game than his role as a specialist  may suggest. “I see myself as an openside, but I don’t shy away from doing stuff in the lineoutrequired,” he added. “I think it depends on what the coaches feel is necessary for Saturday. And whatever they feel, I’m happy to go ahead with.”We will learn what they feel on Thursday, when Townsend announces his squad."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

February  at Flesherin, Point, Dolan worked with his dad making Harris Tweed before getting an apprenticeship with a bakery in Stornoway.However, his ambition was always to join the Merchant Navy, which he did in  in Glasgow.Not long after, he joined the crew of the British-India ship SS Manela which sailed to South Africa during World War Two.Dolan said: “I also went to America, Canada and Australia while at sea and could be away for up to two years at a time, but it was always great to get on the boat in Glasgow and head home to Lewis.“I ed to Lewis for a time after the war and spent many happy years living with my sister Mary Ann down in Back.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":null,"title":"nadine dorries bbc needs saving from itself","story":"Nadine Dorries froze the BBC license fee last year  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNadine Dorries froze the BBC license fee last year By Meg Hill, PAFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the BBC has a problem with “groupthink” and needs saving from itself.Ms Dorries – who froze the BBC licence fee in January – likened the broadcaster to a “polar bear on a shrinking ice cap”.Speaking to the Sunday Times, she said: “There is a problem with groupthink within the BBC, and I don’t think those people think they are left or they are right.“I think they just believe they are absolutely right about everything.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry. We are also very concerned about the lack of adequate consultation with key stakeholders, in particular, the Friends of Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Irish.jpg","title":"Documents of United Irish leader Thomas Russell  shows rich history held  in Down County Museum  ","story":"MANY people in County Down and beyond will be familiar with the words of Florence Mary Wilsonrsquos popular ballad, The Man from God Knows Where, published in  in her best-known collection of poetry, The Coming of the Earls.Her enigmatic subject was Thomas Russell mdash soldier, social reformer and revolutionary mdash who was hanged outside what is now Down County Museum in October .An intimate of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Russell was posted to Belfast as an ensign in the th Regiment of Foot in  and became a founding member of the Society of United Irishmen the following year.Associated with the development of the United Irishmenrsquos insurrectionary strategy in the mid-s, Russell journeyed across Co Down mobilising support for what was expected to be a rebellion supported by French arms. Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , .

Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas.

This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart. It was a day of surprises which will remain in the thoughts of the retiring minister and his we, church members and office-bearers.Although Covid restrictions prevented the members from giving Dr. Steers and Sue a send-off befitting their service to them, such was their appreciation that it took two hours for everyone to say farewell.As the churchrsquos fourth longest serving minister, Dr Steers completed  years in full time charge in addition to being minister-in-charge for several sessions between  and .He was a member of the local ministerial group which organises collective worship and remembrance events such as inter-denominational services and Remembrance Sunday as well as highlighting and supporting worthy causes.Over the years Dr Steers conducted in excess  regular services as well as special services including Christmas celebrations. In addition, he undertook over  memorial services as well as weddings, renewal of vows and baptisms with these totals undoubtedly tripling when the Ballee and Clough churches are included.Dr Steers represented the denomination in  at a special service in Transylvania and attended and conducted the funeral services both here and on the mainland of some of the churchrsquos most distinguished serving ministers.Over the years, while celebrating the churchrsquos tercentenary, Dr Steers was a tremendous support in the church history and, more recently, its graveyard inion booklet.He also compiled a book entitled rsquoFirst World War Roll of Honour of the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Irelandrsquo containing all the members of the denomination who served and who gave their lives in defence of our country. The publication was launched at a special service in our church in November .Former church secretary Mary Stewart added: ldquoWhen the church history is read in years to come our records, just as they have down through the ages, will record names and dates of those who served.ldquoWe know however that a le of service goes beyond this. It includes sharing moments of sadness and tears but also memories of joy and laughter which we have had together in Downpatrick.

PA archive“And yet people’s understanding about plants, except in a very kind of narrow way, has not kept up with that. I think this will bring it home.”It’s a concept that the show’s executive producer Mike Gunton concurs with.“I wanted to do a Planet Earth for plants – because obviously your first thought with plants is, ‘It’s going to be like Gardeners’ World, it’s going to be dull’,” the Bafta-winning producer says, glancing over at Sir David as the broadcaster rehearses his lines.“Planet Earth, I think, gives you a sense that there’s going to be some drama and some scale. It is constructed by habitat, so I wanted to replicate that. There’s tropical worlds, desert worlds, water worlds, seasonal worlds, and human worlds.”Sir David Attenborough address the COP conference in Glasgow on November , As the first ever Creative Director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, Gunton has played a pivotal role in the production of hit BBC documentaries including Planet Earth II, Dynasties and Africa.It’s a proven track record that sees him ideally placed to take on the mammoth challenge posed by The Green Planet. Reuniting with Dynasties series producer Rupert Barrington, the series – which premiered on the eve of November’s COP summit in Glasgow – saw Sir Davidto screens as series narrator.Sir David hopes people, after watching the series, will begin to understand the primordial importance plants play in human le.The veteran naturalist describes the world of plants as “a parallel world on which we depend, and which up to now we have largely ignored,I speak on behalf of urbanised man.”“Over half the population of the world according to the UN are urbanised, live in cities, only see cultivated plants and never see a wild community of plants. “But that wild community is there, outside urban circumstances normally, and we depend upon it. And we better jolly well care for it,” he warns.Recalling how the series proposal was met with the words “we’re ploughing a new furrow” from Sir David, Gunton says he knew the project needed to be an immersive viewing experience in order to capture the minds of viewers.“The green ecosystems are an incredibly strong web which underpins all le – and because it’s so complex and so strong, it’s an unchallengeable Jenga tower,” says Gunton. “What’s been happening is that we’ve been pulling the bricks out, but because we’re plant-blind, we haven’t really cared or noticed that we’ve pulled these bricks out.“As we know, with a Jenga tower,you just pull that last brick out, the whole thing collapses. “What we’re trying to say is, be more aware of those Jenga blocks, becauseyou knock down that tower, it’s curtains.”Noting the ever-present challenge of bringing the natural world to le, Gunton explains how the unit developed never-before-seen technology, resulting in a new approach to filmmaking.Based upon a widely-used technique known as time-lapse photography – a process by which a moving object is photographed consistently over a period of time and when played back, appears as a fast-forwarded video – the concept emerged after producer Paul Williams chanced upon a YouTube video uploaded by American visual engineer, Chris Field.Already a fan of botanical photography, Field had tinkered with existing electronics to create a customised camera capable of capturing the movement of plant le. Together with the BBC’s in-house team, they set about developing the technology in order to not only capture a simple time-lapse, but allow viewers to travel along the rainforest floor alongside plants and insects. It’s a project that also saw the Natural History Unit embrace drone technology – a more eco-friendly and immersive alternative to helicopters. Harnessing the skills of two competitive first-person-view drone pilots, the drones were able to weave through the rainforest canopy at high speed, capturing footage unlike anything previously seen.Recounting how the five year production saw the team – including Sir David, travel the world in search of exotic plant le, it’s clear that age is but a number to the veteran naturalist.“David is in his s, so we had to be quite careful about the number of locations and the amount of time away, but we managed to [go] to all the habitats,” says Gunton, listing off a swathe of trips across South America and Europe. “We’ve been to rainforests, deserts, water worlds, and the Arctic – we actually even went to the Arctic Circle.”The team also travelled to Costa Rica, visiting La Selva Biological Station – and what they saw there should bring hope, as the research centre has become famous for giving vast swathes of their land back to the natural rainforest.“Plants will rewire land for you, and that’s what David is saying,” says Gunton. “The planet heals itself, we just need to give it the chance to do it.”‘I’M SWANNING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT THE MOST FABULOUSLY INTERESTING THINGS’: A POTTED BIO OF SIR DAVIDSir David Attenborough was born on May ,  in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal.He is the middle of three sons his elder brother, Richard , became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John , was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo.Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He spent much time in the grounds of the university. Aged around , he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for d each. The source was a pond right next to the department. In , Sir David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owlat De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was: “Bowled over by the man’s determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. “The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave’s own credo to this day.”Sir David was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in  to study geology and zoology.In , he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In , Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in . Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology at a university in Canberra and his daughter Susan is a former primary school headmistress.Sir David had a pacemaker fitted in June , as well as a double knee replacement in . But the ebullient naturalist and broadcaster’s passion for what he does remains undimmed despite his formidable age.He is quoted as commenting in September : “If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. But I’m not. “I’m swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. “Such good fortune!”‘SURELY WORKING TOGETHER WE ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS PLANET’ SIR DAVID TOLD COP CONFERENCEAt the COP summit in Glasgow on November  last year, Sir David Attenborough called on world leaders and climate change activists to be “motivated by hope rather than fear” to avoid climate catastrophe.Speaking in front of an audience that included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference’s opening ceremony, the broadcaster and naturalist said humanity was “already in trouble”.He also appealed to the political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to .C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in the  Paris climate agreement.Sir David said: “Everything we have achieved in the last , years has been enabled because of the [climate] stability during this time.“The global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either plus or minus one degree Celsius – until now. We are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking.“This story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today, those who have done the least to cause this problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable.“Is this how our story is due to end “A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals ”He added his voice to increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a commitment to the .C temperature limit and called on young people to “rewrite our story”.“Perhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story.“To turn this tragedy into a triumph – we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse.“We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air.”Attenborough also highlighted that “no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable”, and demanded “all nations have a good standard of living and a modest [carbon] footprint”.He concluded: “The people alive now and the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing – did the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here  “There’s every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. “If working apart we are forces powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it.”The Green Planet is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The UK did get much of its early response badly wrong but then became a global leader in terms of vaccine development and rollout.Yet when there was a flow of articles in Ireland, or penned by Irish authors in UK papers, attacking London’s handling of the pandemic, there was no reaction in Britain.You might say this is a reflection of British arrogance, and that is partly true . But it is noticed in informed circles, where the lack of response is rooted in an intuitive understanding that Ireland can attack Britain but by goodness Britain can’t attack Ireland.ImagineIreland was perceived to be wrong on a major matter of public policy, and British commentators said so publicly and repeatedly in media on either side of the Irish Sea. I have never seen that happen, and do not expect to see it.Thus the truth is almost the opposite of the caricature: far from the UK believing in its greatness, it is full of self criticism, while it is Ireland that can act superior. Its president, Michael D Higgins, illustrates this double standard. It is often said that he has done much for reconciliation, which is true in that he has attended a range of ceremonies that show respect for all traditions, including the British and unionist ones. But he talks ashe has an entrenched belief in the historical moral goodness of Ireland and the wrongness of Britain. From time to time he wants to scold us about it.Observers this week, such as the artist Brian John Spencer, have pointed out how inappropriate it is that the head of state of a country which has a school system dominated by the Catholic church should lecture us in Northern Ireland on integrated education.If he was going to attack separate education in NI, why did he not single out the Catholic church for criticism  People talk about Catholic and Protestant schools but as far back as the s, when I was in class, many so-called Protestant schools were schools with a distant church origin that had long since become largely secular and mixed.Schools with a religiously mixed intake were somewhat atypical in that they tended to be grammar schools with many middle class pupils. Even so, it was a trend that has become marked with time. Some such ‘Protestant’ schools in greater Belfast have a : pupil mix.To this day few Catholic schools have that level of integration.Aside from the odd grumble, unionists or British people say little in response to the judgemental speeches from President Higgins.It is hard to imagine a British royal uttering any historical criticism of Ireland. Or even a UK cabinet minister doing so, let alone repeatedly making such speeches.Patience with President Higgins did briefly snap over the Armagh centenary service. An event that was made so neutral that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and certainly did not dare to celebrate it, was nonetheless too much of a recognition of NI for him.Yet his criticism over the years has kept coming: he turned down an invite to an RIC memorial he instructed unionists to be generous over  he said Britain must face up to its history of reprisals he accused Britain of feigned amnesia over imperialism of not treating the Irish as equals over the famine for its handling of an Indian mutiny.Here is a suggestion to President Higgins. If he is going to impart his views so freely, andhe is keen on reconciliation, then surprise us. Talk about Troubles statistics, and acknowledge the unionist wound, particularly in border areas, at the fact that republicans killed twice as many people as anyone , and often fled to a Republic that would not extradite them.If that is too stark a topic, then speak of the good things, such as the lingering British cultural and physical infrastructure in the Republic — the architecture or the system of laws and parliamentary democracy.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: Northern Ireland again escapes extreme weather as Storm Eunice passesOther opinion articles here:• Henry McDonald: Fans on both sides of ide agree that football stadiums are a disgrace• Lord Empey: It is right and proper that the victims of Bloody Friday terror are commemorated• Anna Faro: Big surge in empty pews just another problem for churches that were already struggling pre-pandemic• Ben Habib: This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea border• Ruth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from Alliance• Letter: The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bomb"},{"url":null,"title":"henry mcdonald fans on both sides agree football stadiums are a disgrace ","story":"Unionists should join forces with Bloody Sunday families   Storm Franklin : Heres what the next storm is called after Storm Eunice - and when it could hit the UKNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionHenry McDonald: Fans on both sides of ide agree that football stadiums are a disgraceThe Irish League may have scored an important victory over the Sinn Fein Communities Minister when it emerged on Thursday night that Deirdre Hargey may write to fellow ministers to unlock £. million to refurbish grounds.By Henry McDonaldSaturday, th February , : amUpdated Saturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  Children play at a dilapidated Solitude stadium where Henry McDonald is a lelong Cltonville fan. There was better value football matches there some days than from highly paid stars at Goodison ParkBefore that announcement it appeared that Irish football clubs were going to lose the multi-million scheme that could have redeveloped local stadia.The minister’s initial decision to halt the funding while at the same approving of millions to redevelop the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast came under fierce criticism within the local football community.However, some of that criticism clouded the real issue and indeed the cause of the Irish League by suggesting her original determination was motivated by sectarianism. Because it clunkily characterised the policy as one of pitting the allegedly Catholic-Nationalist GAA against an allegedly Protestant-Nationalist Irish Football community. Which to those who follow and love the Irish League is an objectionable, inaccurate stereotyping of the local sport.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.An interest declaration at this stage: I am a lelong Cltonville supporter who can still remember the darker days when the Troubles in Northern Ireland cast a shadow over the game. I recall a time when going to matches away from home was often physically perilous and when you could be subjected to attacks involving hand grenades courtesy of the UFF, bricks, bottles, steel so-called ‘Chinese darts’ and even hot coals chucked over us by irate grannies.On top of the physical violence and threats there was the ubiquitous sectarian chanting and abuse which lasted for decades.In fairness and in total honesty some of us were not blameless angels either and I am still ashamed of aspects of my own teenage behaviour following the Reds at certain fixtures in the late s and early to mid s.Mercully those days have faded far into the past and the atmosphere around grounds in the st century across Northern Ireland has been generally become de-toxied.The Irish League and the IFA have a code of conduct outlawing sectarian and racial abuse, which by and large the overwhelming majority of fans adhere to. Hooliganism is an extreme rarity and even when there is an odd outbreak of thuggery the fan bases condemn it without equivocation.In relation to the other important stuff – the quality of the football on the pitch – there has been a marked improvement over the last  years or more in the pace, passing and moving in Irish League games.A few weeks ago, on some rare days off I watched for nostalgia purposes reruns of ‘The Big Match’ on ITV. One of the most striking things about revisiting topflightclashes between the likes of West Ham and Spurs in the s was how much slower the tempo of even English elite football was the time.It also hit me thatyou could time travel one of the current leading Irish League football teams back to land-of-the-seventies given their pacey play they could give these top English sides from those days a real run for their money on the field.Whatever side you support at whichever level in Irish League football there is plenty to be proud of about the local game these days. As someone who has spent far too many tears and treasure watching often disinterested multi-millionaire English Premiership footballers sometimes casually lose games in the most lucrative league in the world the Irish League by contrast gives the ordinary fan real value for money.For instance, I remember one scintillating Saturday afternoon at Solitude attending a thrilling - draw with Linfield about a decade ago. Later that evening I sailed across the Irish Sea for the Merseyside derby which ended the next day in a drab - draw.The entrance fee at the North Belfast stadium cost £ while it was the guts of £ to enter Goodison Park  hours later. I know which game I was short changed in.The one aspect of Irish League football which is still a crying shame is the dilapidated nature of so many of stadia. From decaying, rotting stands like the old main stand at Solitude to the vile toilets at other grounds across Northern Ireland the state of the stadiums has long been a disgrace. Fans regardless of their religious or political allegiances were and are united in seeing a province wide upgrade of their grounds.The £. million initially promised to transform these grounds was aimed at giving supporters decent surroundings to watch their teams in safety, comfort, and dignity. The Northern Ireland Football League’s tenacious campaign under Gerard Lawlor may finally have paid idends. However, to depict that struggle was one tainted by sectarianism is to dengrate that achievement.  To refract that battle through the prism of sectarian ision was something clubs and their fans didn’t need in forcing the minister’s U-turn.Other opinion articles here:• Ben Lowry: Surprise us President Higgins, say something nice about Britain• Lord Empey: It is right and proper that the victims of Bloody Friday terror are commemorated• Anna Faro: Big surge in empty pews just another problem for churches that were already struggling pre-pandemic• Ben Habib: This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea border• Ruth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from Alliance• Letter: The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bomb"},{"url":null,"title":"how is storm eunice affecting traffic and travel in northern ireland ","story":"Storm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snow   What time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit - and will it snow in Northern Ireland NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsWeatherStorm Eunice round-up: Has Storm Eunice finished  - Whats the weather forecast for this evening Strom Eunice moved through Northern Ireland after causing disruptionBy Michael CousinsFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  Thank you for following our Live Blog post on Storm Eunice.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeedffdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfefbbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeedffdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfefbbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645203863237.jpg--covid_19___fri_18th_feb_figures.jpg?164520386300","title":"covid  fri th feb figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
