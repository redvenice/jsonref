We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together like skiing and riding horses.’He also said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he wanted to ‘break the ice’ between the United States and North Korea.The former NBA player has thus far made five trips to North Korea, the most recent of which was in June 2017 in which he insisted he was ‘trying to accomplish something that we both need\u0027.Rodman’s bond with Kim is so close that he will reportedly be at the upcoming June 12 summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, though the White House recently rebuked the notion that the retired NBA player should play a role in the high-level diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea.

According to witness statements, after being woken by smoke alarms, a resident called the fire brigade just before 1am.Four fire engines arrived at the scene minutes later and as the crew dealt with the fire in the fridge freezer, flames began to grow in other areas of the kitchen and images revealed that it had spread to the cladding before the firefighters had even arrived.As the fire continued to spread, by 2am the London Fire Bridge had declared it a ‘major incident’ and at this point, around 40 fire engines were at the location or on their way. In addition to this, because of Grenfell Tower’s ‘stay put’ fire policy, many residents were told to remain in their flats by emergency services.The ‘stay put’ order was abandoned at just before 3am and 65 people were rescued from the building by firefighters, 144 managing to escape before the order was abandoned, but only 36 after. By 4:30am, the entire building was engulfed and the fire did not stop until 1am the next day.          Photo issued by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry of the kitchen in Flat 16 where the fire startedGrenfell Tower vigilWriting for the Evening Standard, Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed that she will ‘always regret’ not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower after the disaster and made it clear the belief she ‘didn’t care’ was ‘never the case’.She continued: ‘What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair.‘And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.’ The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been halted for a week so that memorials and vigils can take place to mark the anniversary.The North Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary and at 1:30am BST on Thursday, June 14, the names of all the fire’s victims will be read out at St Clement’s church.At 12pm, survivors and the bereaved will also gather near Grenfell Tower for a minute’s silence, the tower being lit green alongside 12 other tower blocks in the area, from 12:54am, the time the fire is thought to have started and will be for the following four evenings.

She wants nurseries to teach children these basic skills if parents have failed to do so, to make sure they are ‘school ready’ by the age of five.But yesterday’s LSE study casts doubt over the abilities of nurseries to solve the issue when some children are simply being kept at home.It found almost one in five children delays taking up a free place in pre-school education – most of them from low-income families.Around one third of persistently poor children delays, compared to one sixth of their higher-income peers.The researchers found that persistently poor children are 13 percentage points less likely to attend for the full five terms of free pre-school education than children from higher-income families.Parents need to take mobile phones away from children at...Primary school bans shoes for pupils and teachers so they...Share this articlePersistently poor children were defined as who were eligible for the ‘pupil premium’ – a deprivation indicator – for all three years of early primary school.In addition, migrant children – those who speak English as an additional language – were nearly three times more likely not to take up their full five terms as their peers.The LSE researchers said the findings were worrying because nursery is a key component to bridging the gap in attainment between rich and poor children.Author Dr Tammy Campbell said: ‘Universally funded pre-school education is not, in fact, being accessed equally by all children.‘The families who are benefitting most from the policy are those who are already advantaged in many ways – while low-income children miss out.‘It’s time for a clear and transparent reassessment of the purpose of funding for the pre-school stage – looking properly at which children win under the current system, and at who misses out.’Since 2004, all three and four-year-olds have been allowed a free nursery place.In 2010 the entitlement rose from 12.5 to 15 hours a week and in 2013, free places were extended to two-year-olds from low-income families.In 2017, there was an additional expansion to 30 funded hours a week for three and four-year-olds with working parents.          Poorer parents are less likely to send their pre-school child to nursery even though it is free, according to research (stock image used)The paper, ‘“Universal” early education: who benefits?’, was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and is published in the British Educational Research Journal.It found the free places have been ‘disproportionately benefitting’ children from higher income families who ‘least need a head start’.It said: ‘With over £2,000 now allocated annually to each eligible child, these places have become the central initiative aimed at creating a more equitable start for children in England.‘This is especially true given the squeeze since 2010 on funding for other early childhood initiatives, including Sure Start children’s centres, as well as reductions in cash benefits for families with young children.’The researchers also examined whether the type of pre-school provision available locally makes a difference to take-up.They found that in areas where more children take their places in Sure Start centres, take-up was highest among all children – and the gap between low- and higher-income children much smaller.In contrast, areas with most pre-school places provided through the private sector have the largest gap in take-up between low- and higher-income families.The authors called on the government to re-think their policy to make sure more disadvantaged children benefitted from nurseries.It comes after education secretary Damian Hinds spoke of the tragedy of children turning up to school unable to understand basic commands.Studies have shown these children quickly fall behind and can underachieve for the rest of their lives.Earlier this year, Mr Hinds launched a series of initiatives targeted at disadvantaged families encouraging them to read to their children and sing nursery rhymes, in a bid to help them learn more vocabulary."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24111300000578-0-image-m-61_1528747601388.jpg","title":"Midwives ordered not judge new mothers choose bottle feed","story":"    New mothers will no longer be made to feel guilty for not breastfeedingIn the past the college has championed the benefits of breastfeeding, urging its exclusive use for the first six months.Only a third of British mothers achieve this target, making for one of the lowest rates in the world.

One mother wrote of her primary school age son: ‘Yesterday he saw a poster with a man and child in a swimming pool ... and commented that it would be a perfect shot to blow their heads off.’Another added that her son, aged nine, had become addicted and she had imposed a ban on the game after his ‘behaviour deteriorated massively’. She wrote: ‘It was awful to see how angry he was becoming ... I seriously wish I’d never let him on it.’Fortnite’s creators could not be reached for comment.Are you worried about the amount of time your children spend playing violent games like Fortnite? Email games@dailymail.co.uk  My boys wanted to play it rather than go on the beach in Barbados...By Beezy Marsh Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began. But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.But one weekend not long after Christmas, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.          Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began says Beezy Marsh, pictured here with her 13-year-old son Idris TaylorSo, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/01/4D2556BB00000578-5832943-image-a-36_1528762877480.jpg","title":"Netflix goes streaming service outage UK Australia America","story":"    Netflix has crashed, leaving viewers around the world unable to connect to the popular streaming service (stock image)          We are aware of members having trouble streaming on all devices,\u0027 Netflix said in a statement after the mystery outageDismayed subscribers were given a message reading \u0027Netflix error: this title is not available to watch instantly\u0027 while trying to watch movies and TV shows.Others were told \u0027Sorry, something went wrong.

Now, in the age of Trump, they’re haunted by decline. He talks about fame, his legacy – and Kanye WestShortly after meeting Ed Ruscha, in an office space deep within the bowels of the National Gallery, we’re confronted by a terrifying vision. It’s Donald Trump. And he’s naked.“Oh boy,” mutters the man JG Ballard once claimed had the “coolest gaze in American art”. He averts said gaze from the image in question – a book illustrated with Illma Gore’s grotesque depiction of the president, complete with fleshy rolls and tiny stubby penis – and shakes his head. “I think the art world’s still in shock by it, we’ve not had time to react yet,” he says. “We’re all sitting in an electric chair.” He grabs the sides of his seat and mimics a rush of high voltage, before laughing. Of course, you could argue that Ruscha commented on the Trump presidency back before Trump was even thinking of running for president. His Course of Empire series, which opens on Monday at the National Gallery, might not be directly about Trump or even politics (“That word can mean anything so I tend to dance away from it,” he notes). But it’s hard to view its depiction of the turbo-speed transformation of the modern United States without seeing it as a warning sign. The exhibition hangs Ruscha’s 1992 series Blue Collar – five black-and-white canvases featuring buildings in LA – above updated versions he made a decade or so later, this time in colour and with each location radically changed. The trade school is now surrounded by a barbed wire fence. The phone booth no longer has a reason to exist, so it doesn’t. The tool and die factory is now emblazoned with Korean-style calligraphy (Ruscha invented the meaningless typeface himself, speaking to global companies’ lack of transparency – what do they even do?). Logos have faded, fences corroded, and graffiti has sprung up. It’s the kind of transformation that has left many Americans feeling adrift. And it at least partly explains why so many chose to elect a president who claimed he could bring the old America back. That phrase could sum up the foreboding that lurks in Ruscha’s work, zen visions of the modern American west infused with a sense of impending apocalypse. Now 80, he’s a little unsteady on his feet but sharp as a tack. His photography and paintings have helped define modern America – its gas stations, corporate logos and prairies. But there’s often an unsettling undertow – as in his most famous work, The Los Angeles County Museum on Fire. Ruscha’s word paintings, in which pithy phrases are afforded the same towering scale as mountain ranges, can be many things: enigmatic, playful and sometimes seemingly plain dumb. But often they unnerve – Pay Nothing Until April The Music From the Balconies Nearby Was Overlaid by the Noise of Sporadic Acts of Violence. One series focuses on the simple phrase The End. Are we approaching it? Ruscha, pronounced roo-SHAY, was born in Nebraska, but grew up in Oklahoma. It took an On the Road-style drive to Los Angeles with his friend, the writer and musician Mason Williams, to awaken his artistic instinct. Over that 1,400-mile trip, in a car that used “as much oil as it did gasoline”, Ruscha found himself mesmerised by the utilitarian beauty of the remote gas stations dotted along the open landscape – he’d later produce his first artist’s book, 1963’s Twentysix Gasoline Stations, and his iconic Standard Station variations.While the gravitational pull of New York’s art scene was overwhelming, Ruscha’s inidualist streak nudged him towards LA. His preferred school, Artcenter, didn’t have a place for him, a setback that proved to be fortuitous. Artcenter had a strict dress code – “no facial hair, berets or bringing a bongo to class” – whereas Chouinard Art Institute, where he ended up, let students do “whatever you want”. Had he got into his favoured college, Ruscha may not have become one of America’s most renowned artists. “I might be designing the rear wheel of a Toyota instead,” he says. “Who knows?”Ruscha never considered art as a viable career and kept himself afloat painting signs and designing books. An early break came when he was included in the landmark 1962 pop art exhibition New Painting of Common Objects at the Pasadena Art Museum, alongside Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Ruscha knew Warhol: “They made fun of him, but he really saw the light ... a very pure light and he was able to grab it. His movies should be considered in the all-time pantheon of movie-making, but people in Hollywood would just say, ‘This guy’s a fake’ or ‘He’s putting us on.’ Maybe he was, but I found his ideas very profound.” One of Ruscha’s first sales was to Dennis Hopper, and the pair became friends. Did he encounter the actor’s dark side? “He had drug problems and explosive moments – none that I had to fully experience in the raw. I knew that he had periods of depression and he had lady problems” – he smiles at this euphemism. “He also had problems with a lot of people because he had ideas that he thought should be run his way. And I’m all for that.” At the National, Ruscha’s Course of Empire is displayed concurrently with the series that inspired it – Thomas Cole’s The Course of Empire, which depicts the rise and fall of a civilisation across five canvases. Although vastly different works, the two artists share many similarities. Both can be said to have reinvented the American landscape tradition (Cole was born in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1801, but moved to the States) both are obsessed with the passage of time, and both can be said to instil portent within their works. “His was driven purely by a hatred of the progress of mankind, clear-cutting forests, things we’ve all lived through for many years since his death,” says Ruscha. “If you were to go back, find the place that he set up his canvas for The Oxbow” – Cole’s 1836 masterpiece that warned of the folly of cultivating land – “then you’d be greatly shocked. I see all kinds of trouble in the world, but I think he would weep at the poetry of change.” If Cole issued alarms about the burgeoning expansion of the American empire, Ruscha’s work, which documented its glitzy Hollywood peak, now seems to be warning us that it’s concluding. Does he think it is? “It’s a knock on the door, isn’t it? It’s a tender reminder that we might be at the end of our Rome.” The hectic pace of change is equally apparent when looking at the art world’s transformation. Ruscha started out painting for “sport” – money didn’t enter into the equation. Now his paintings can fetch tens of million dollars. He seems bemused by this change of fortunes, although his faith in the quality of his work remains solid. “I’ve done things that I’ve felt were kissed by angels,” he says. “I’ve tried to open the gates of heaven, as all artists hope to. Whether we do or not is another matter.” I wonder how he views his influence – especially in mainstream pop culture where word art is everywhere, from memes to inspirational gift cards. On the day we meet, Kanye West has just released his album Ye, featuring a sleeve of the Wyoming mountains with the text “I hate being bipolar it’s awesome” scrawled over it. “Oh boy,” says Ruscha, reading the words aloud to himself. Does he see his influence in juxtapositions like this? “I think that could have come from anywhere,” he says, politely declining any connection. “All art comes out of other art, but I don’t see my influence that widely.” Is he disappointed by that? “Not at all. As a matter of fact, it kind of isolates me in a nice way.”Isolation suits Ruscha. He built a home in the Mojave desert several decades ago and still returns there when he needs space. “The constant reminder that there is very little change, even over 40 or 50 years, invigorates me,” he says. It also reassures him when faced with his many fears about modern life – the rise of robotics, the mining of our data, the blurring of truths. The accelerated culture he’s documented so perfectly is starting to leave him in the dust, he admits. “I come across people every so often who think, God, he doesn’t have an iPhone, that’s disgusting! He’s no patriot!” he says, laughing heartily. “But I didn’t have an interest in the internet and I still don’t. The way I look at it is – it’s too late to learn.” Looking at Course of Empire, you wonder if that’s true of all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea932ecf922fdba53f668f44e24f80daa270b8b8/36_242_2574_1545/master/2574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382d99532745eb742978f0428f024aaf","title":"to forget is to offend the slave trade legacy nicola lo calzo in pictures","story":"From carnival-goers in the West Indies to voodoo ceremonies in west Africa, Nicola Lo Calzo’s photography confronts us with memories of slavery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1884f1c790cef1929178d3bd4e3ac5ac4e6d5b59/0_77_4620_2773/master/4620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4bd91bada7fbfa966f828abbf8aa191","title":"the female persuasion meg wolitzer review","story":"The dynamics of a female mentoring relationship are at the heart of Meg Wolitzer’s witty and perceptive novelWhere are we right now? With feminism and all that? There was the vote. We got the vote, which was lovely. Then there was work, and the pill, and sexual liberation, which was all great, and today there’s #MeToo, and Beyoncé, and something else – something like a sinking feeling: a realisation that these might have been a series of battles won, rather than the war promised.Meg Wolitzer’s 11th novel sympathetically satirises this complicated landscape of contemporary feminism, while also pressing knowingly against these bruises. It’s 2006, and Greer Kadetsky is at her first college party when a frat boy reaches into her top and twists her breast, hard. This small violence ignites her political awakening, but it’s meeting second-wave feminist icon Faith Frank, author of such books as The Female Persuasion (and, in recent years, less influential sequels including, oh God, The Email Persuasion), a woman who’s “a couple of steps down from Gloria Steinem in fame”, that gives her earnest ambition some focus.Faith hands her an embossed business card, and Greer holds on to it as “a reminder not to stay hot-faced and tiny-voiced”. Four years later, Greer calls the number and gets a job at the new feminist nonprofit Faith has founded, with backing from a questionable venture capitalist. Her desk is a vast white door, repurposed from a building where secret suffrage meetings had taken place. The foundation is called\u0026nbspLoci, and it will host conferences as well as fund “special projects” to provide help for women around the world.Wolitzer spikes these feminist conferences with the most delicate pin – Loci’s meetings evolve into expensive symposiums where celebrities make puns about balls to rapturous applause. These will surely be familiar to readers attuned to the very modern disconnect of today’s feminist conferences, where fancy ladies pay a fortune to listen to speeches about poverty, raising a glass of prosecco to the plights of women before sighing off home with a cupcake, a tote bag and the slightly bloated feeling of having done all they can. “Naturally,” Wolitzer writes of Loci, “people were writing things on Twitter like #whiteladyfeminism and #richladies, and the hashtag that for some reason irritated Faith most, #fingersandwichfeminism.” Manicurists are laid on for ticket holders, along with a feminist psychic. Greer is tasked with writing speeches for the disenfranchised, the voiceless.Except, just as real life for Greer is beginning, her boyfriend Cory’s life swerves off road when a family death sends him home, and he must sacrifice his burgeoning career to care for his mother, taking over her job cleaning houses. Adults now, their lives erging, every time Greer sees Cory she feels a pain “as strong as a flare-up of a chronic illness”. Despite the fact that (as Greer’s stoner mum points out) what Cory’s doing looks an awful lot like feminism.But the central relationship is between mentor and mentee in this, a novel where the pacing is almost orchestral, from the perceptive, crushing details of teenage love to whole lives summarised in a scattering of anecdotes about desire. If, because of its political prescience, this book is read as the “MeToo novel”, then friction between Greer and Faith is inevitable. Today old and young feminists are being pitted against one another over issues such as victimhood, or automatically believing a person who says they’ve been abused, or even the question of what a woman is. Which is why it feels slightly surprising that, here, the defining fight between the two is over something as seemingly passive as Faith’s choice to ignore ethical negligence on one of their special projects, the rescue of a group of trafficked women in Ecuador. Greer, however, despite quitting Loci (Wolitzer’s characters, written with an aching sort of kindness, are so committed and idealistic in their quest to do what’s right it makes the reader vaguely despise herself), continues to idolise Faith herself.Wolitzer has a knack of spreading time like it’s butter. The effect is oddly dizzying – having sat with this story for the equivalent of 50 years, the reader finally looks up from the page with the disconcerting realisation she knows even the most minor character better than her own son. Suddenly we’ve lapped ourselves, arriving at a party to celebrate Greer’s bestselling Lean In-type book, Outside Voices (a too-neat reference to her first conversation with Faith). It’s midway through the Trump administration or, as Wolitzer describes it, “the big terribleness”, and Greer, now married\u0026nbspwith a child, is planning to launch her own foundation. While Faith’s breakthrough book taught women to utilise their gentle femininity to make change, Greer’s teaches them how to speak for themselves. Both have found fame, fans and power. There is a mirroring\u0026nbspacross the ages. But also an anxiety to their success. Men “always get to set the terms… they just come in and set them”, Greer complains. “They don’t ask, they just do it… I don’t want to keep repeating this forever. I don’t want to keep having to live in the buildings they make.” In a building across town, Faith still runs Loci, but from a smaller office – her suffrage door desk has had to have a few inches shaved off the top.This novel might have benefited from similar carpentry, but despite that, it is warm and witty, and necessary. Unlike a women’s summit, nobody will come away from this novel feeling either tipsy or empowered. There are no free keyrings. Instead, it asks us to consider the state of contemporary feminism and the ways we use pedestals. We leave Greer in 2019, questioning the power of her bestseller. “You could use your outside voice and scream your head off, but sometimes it didn’t seem as if the screaming was doing anything at all.”With affection and generosity, Wolitzer exposes the limits of power through a handful of well-meant lives and she leaves us uneasy. The sense that we may have smashed a glass ceiling, but now are standing in the shards, discreetly bleeding.• The Female Persuasion by Meg Wolitzer is published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus (£14.99).

The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. The barometer of hiring sentiment comes as Britain’s factories unexpectedly recorded the sharpest drop in output for more than five years in April, amid falling demand for steel and electrical machinery. The figures are likely to stoke concerns the UK economy is reaching its lowest ebb since the Greek debt crisis of 2012, a year when George Osborne was booed at the London 2012 Paralympics as the coalition government pushed through austerity measures with damaging consequences for living standards. Official figures showed Britain fell into a double-dip recession in the first months of that year, although the downturn was later revised away to show growth was flat in hindsight.Although the situation does not appear to be as severe this year, forecasts issued by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday suggest the UK has done little to bounce back from heavy snowfall earlier in 2018, when the ”beast from the east” caused a sharp drop in output.Ministers are likely to be worried by the picture the figures paint for the state of the British industrial sector, with the steel industry facing mounting pressure from US import tariffs. Industry insiders fear the tariffs could rekindle the crisis of two years ago, when a glut of Chinese imports threatened to bankrupt British producers.They also show the UK’s trade position with the rest of the world deteriorated further in April. Britain’s trade in goods deficit, which is the difference between products sold abroad and imported to the UK, unexpectedly widened by about £2bn to reach £14bn – the biggest monthly gap since September 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c09929e03984153dc64ea15d53a5b7b8604307e/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b0243dcdd83162e682ae23aa628e19c","title":"markets uk unemployment pay rises us inflation sterling business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, including the latest UK labour market report Economist Shaun Richards says we should watch out for total wage growth in today’s jobs report (that’s pay including bonuses).Overnight, Larry Kudlow - the director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council - was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack.Trump broke the news on Twitter, shortly before his summit with Kim.Kudlow, a former TV personality and Wall Street economist, only joined the White House in March. He’s an important advisor to Trump, and a supporter of free trade, and it’s not clear who might cover his duties while he recuperates.Kudlow hit the headlines on Sunday after accusing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of “essentially double-crossing President Trump”.Paul Donovan of UBS thinks investors should focus on the crisis at the G7, rather than Trumps’s meeting with Kim.The US president seems to have a better relationship with the North Korean leader than with the Canadian leader. Markets don’t care too much about North Korea. Markets do care about US relations with Canada.Sue Trinh of RBC says investors shouldn’t get too excited by Kim’s pledge to work towards ‘complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula.Both sides stand far, far apart on what denuclearisation means. To the US, it means NK must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means NK suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the US stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region (basically dismantling its alliance with South Korea and ultimately the region as a whole). Kim has never announced the intention of abandoning his existing nuclear arsenal, which he calls a “treasured sword”.Per previous peace deals, the main issue will be the pace of implementation, which includes agreement on a verification protocol.

After holding hours of talks, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down before the world’s media and signed a ‘comprehensive’ agreement, pledging to work towards peace on the Korean peninsula.Photos of the document also show that North Korea has committed to “work towards” complete denuclearisation.That’s a welcome aspiration, but not a full-blooded commitment it will actually happen. Kim hasn’t agreed to any explicit missile reductions, for example.Trump declared that the two leaders had enjoyed a “really fantastic meeting”, while Kim spoke about “a big prelude to peace”.Britain’s FTSE 100 is up a modest 6 points.We’re tracking all the developments here:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Today we learn how Britain’s labour market is faring, as the warning lights flash on the UK economy.Overnight, recruitment firm ManpowerGroup has reported that company bosses are at their most pessimistic since 2012 -- due to worries over Brexit and the high street slowdown.The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer.With manufacturing output hitting a six-year low yesterday, and construction output also disappointing, the economy appears to be at its weakest point since the eurozone crisis was raging six years ago.So, today’s unemployment figures will be scrutinised for signs of weakness.But, the number of jobs created over the last quarter could drop to around 110,000, from 197,000 in the three months to March. That could signal that the labour market is cooling.Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains:Even though there have been a number of large surprises to the upside in the employment data over the last six months, it will be very difficult for gains in employment to match last month’s very strong +197k 33m.It’s a big day for Brexit, as parliament votes on an amendment to give MPs give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. This would put the House of Commons in charge if MPs were to reject the government’s final orce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government’s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Sterling could be volatile if Theresa May fails to block the amendment.The US Federal Reserve is already expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, following a two-day meeting starting today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc5615b977b25e5abe3648f7387debc3386463f/0_0_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46e78bcdc52a50a5f338400a061bc7b","title":"could berlin tegel airport be reborn as a nightclub","story":"Tegel airport is being eyed up as a new venue – but plans are meeting with ambivalence as clubbers see their subculture becoming more mainstreamBerlin’s clubbing scene has long taken a creative approach to issues of space, setting events in former power stations, drained swimming pools and public toilets. Now its main airport is joining the list of alternative venues.With Tegel airport set to close following the long-awaited opening of Berlin Brandenburg airport, currently scheduled for October 2020, plans are already being made for the next chapter in its history. Last month Berlin’s culture minister, Klaus Lederer, and Lutz Leichsenring of the Club Commission joined project planners for a tour of Tegel to imagine it reborn as a nightclub.Tegel’s air traffic control towers, expansive hangar and soundproof jet engine testing hall were highlighted as potential spaces for a mixture of temporary and permanent music venues for open-air festivals, studios and clubs. The vision for Tegel also includes new housing and a tech hub. “A whole new district of the city will be born,” says Daniel Bartsch, spokesman for Lederer. “I think Tegel will become a figurehead for the city’s modernity and ersity.”Leichsenring was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities of a basement space he was shown complete with metal pipes, machinery and a readymade industrial aesthetic: “It reminded me of the space underneath the swimming pool in Stattbad Wedding, a former club in Berlin.”Architecture is important to Berlin’s clubbing scene, Leichsenring says: “The Berlin scene doesn’t want anything too clean or chic. It focuses instead on the basics: having a good soundsystem and good bookings. And it is always good to have a building where you see the history when you walk in. Berlin clubs like to work with the shape and the soul of the building.”Situated 8km north-west of the city centre, Tegel’s site was originally used for rocket testing during the second world war and was set to be turned into allotments due to severe bomb damage. However, the first plane landed there in November 1948 after a runway was built in just 90 days to help support Tempelhof airport during the Berlin airlift, when Allied forces in the late 40s broke the Soviet blockade of west Berlin by airlifting goods in directly. It’s been the city’s key passenger airport since the 1970s. Tegel has been operating far longer than intended, though, with the Berlin-Brandenburg originally due to open in 2012. Technical issues, scandals and multiple delays in its construction have turned it into a running joke among Berliners, with a majority voting to keep Tegel open in a nonbinding referendum last year. Critics, however, argue Tegel’s concrete hexagonal terminal building and infrastructure are ill-equipped to meet the city’s growing number of air passengers.Clubbing has also changed a lot in recent decades, as the formerly countercultural scene has been subsumed into the city’s brand. “When the Club Commission was set up in 2000, the club scene was associated with drugs and criminals,” says Leichsenring. “Now it is widely accepted to be part of the DNA and appeal of the city.”He founded the Creative Footprint nonprofit organisation to research live music venues in the city and protect its nightlife from the increasing pressures of regulation, rising rents and property development. “It is very important that with Tegel we talk about building additional clubbing space for the city, and not somehow giving up what we already have,” he says. “Over the years many, many clubs have had to close.”Ben de Biel, a photographer and former club owner, laments the lack of suitable sites: “In the first few years after the wall fell there were so many empty spaces. The first club I opened was in 1991 in an illegally squatted set of flats. It was easy: we found a house, had a look around, broke in, changed the locks and then started a club. Today there is little affordable empty space for clubs left.”De Biel says Tegel’s remote location is less likely to be a drawback to clubbers than the process of its development. He can point to a number of clubs that have thrived outside the S-Bahn train line circling the city centre, but adds: “Normally the clubbing scene itself decides what could be an interesting or sexy site.”Sven von Thülen, DJ and co-writer of the Sound of Family, an oral history of the Berlin clubbing scene, is sceptical of the plans. “I cannot see people from Berlin actually going there,” says Thülen. “I can only see it being a tourist trap. “For a long time Berlin clubs were about reclaiming the city and revitalising forgotten spaces. They were developed from the bottom up … Tegel could be an interesting physical space but it would be a top-down development, a kind of sanitised place.”Considering the ongoing saga of the new Brandenburg airport, it is unlikely Berlin clubbers will get the chance to head to Tegel any time soon. Yet the ambivalence over the proposed club feels fitting in a city that has seen its clubbing subculture become mainstream and its previously squatted venues turn into prime real estate.Leichsenring is keen to ensure the Tegel redevelopment is an opportunity for smaller grassroots groups to develop organically. He envisages it as not only an open-air festival space, but a site for exhibitions, creative agencies, markets, recording studios and rehearsal rooms.“The clubbing scene in Berlin doesn’t need any more commercial spaces,” he says. “We need more accessible space for experimentation, for new sounds, and for communities. We don’t want one club where you can just drop 5,000 people in there at the weekend – we want lots of smaller creative cells, and these spaces don’t need lots of investment.“You basically just have to rip everything out of them and start the first party.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a55254d37da4340e737662f6fe79b23393d7886/0_195_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b7e079810646a0e61b6fd47f378cbf","title":"housing true cost privatisation right to buy landlords","story":"Right to buy has been a success for landlords but a disaster for those most in need of a homeCouncil homes are being sold off far more quickly than new social homes are being built, a new report has warned. The research into the government’s right-to-buy scheme, by the Local Government Association, finds that this has been the case since 2012: at no point has the social housebuilding rate matched, or come close to matching, the rate at which homes are being sold.Right to buy was given a boost by the Conservatives after the 2010 election in an attempt to sell even more homes, since traditionally homeowners tend to vote Tory. In 2013, the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced the maximum discount available for those renting a council home in London would rise to £100,000. In effect he’d approved the asset-stripping of some of our most-needed council stock.Across the country, home ownership is in crisis, with renting exorbitantly expensive and young people especially – even those in professional jobs – being priced out of the market. Their earnings disappear into the pockets of private landlords, while the finances of local government are given a kicking.Council housing works because it pays for itself relatively quickly: the rent paid by tenants covers the building costs in the long term, and eventually makes a profit for the local authority, which continues to invest in the local area. The money continues to circulate within the community rather than simply boosting the profits of landlords.But with councils forced to sell to tenants through right to buy, then being obliged to give a chunk of the receipts straight to Whitehall, building becomes ever more difficult. And the property shortfall is expensive, as\u0026nbspauthorities struggle to house their homeless residents. Last year £8.4m was spent by 23 councils to rent 725\u0026nbspflats\u0026nbspas temporary accommodation, the magazine Inside Housing found. A vast transfer of wealth has taken place from the public to the private sector, under the guise of helping the aspirational working class. Instead, we’ve just made it harder to provide housing for those most in need.The folly of right to buy echoes the mess that is Britain’s rail system. In the mid-90s, John Major – echoing Margaret Thatcher’s disdain for the state a decade earlier – believed that breaking up British Rail would create competition, and that competition would ensure greater services and be far more efficient than control by the bloated state. Instead, the cost of train travel has become exorbitant, the service appalling almost everywhere you attempt to travel, and the state is constantly required to intervene – either because a franchise has collapsed, in the case of the east coast mainline, or because the rail service has become chaotic, witness recent weeks in the north and the south-east.The long-term effects of privatising both rail and housing, aside from ensuring we live in a country of crumbling infrastructure (in contrast to mainland Europe), is one of diminished social and personal opportunities. Many people are unable to see friends and family as often as they’d like due to the cost of rail travel. Others are delaying having children, or wondering if they can afford them at all, since they cannot afford to buy a home and landlords can be hostile to children. Those with children are in no better position: well oOverMore than 100,000 children are living in temporary accommodation, usually due to eviction.Right to buy was popular, but with 1.8m council homes having been sold off, there are now about 750,000 households paying far more than a local authority rent. Housing, not buying, should be a right – and available and affordable for all. Right to buy is devastating our housing system, just as rail privatisation has devastated our transport infrastructure. Privatisation rarely works: we need new ideas, and far more public ownership of housing, infrastructure and utilities, if we wish to provide for our citizens.• Dawn Foster is a regular contributor to the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe7313ef0f45dff36afcc1a80df95c68a0e6f0c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3168d86f226cf9e20f3896e571ab548","title":"life on moon chris hadfield","story":"Governments should work with private space companies to make lunar colonies a reality in our lifetime • Chris Hadfield is an astronautThe history of all species is that our offspring tend to leave home in search of new habitations and locations in which to settle and live. That’s how bumblebees, ants and human populations have spread across the planet. Incremental exploration is followed by settlement. It’s fundamental animal nature: it’s what we do. Yet, on a planetary scale, we’re always somewhat limited both by our ability to improvise and come up with new ways to do it, and how to fund it.We’ve had a permanent presence in space for the past 18 years, on the International Space Station. And we’re also now, thanks in part to privately funded initiatives such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX or Blue Origin – the space-flight company founded by Jeff Bezos – suddenly beginning to see Mars as we never have before. The growing public interest in these endeavours will encourage the intensification of meaningful space exploration. Look at the popularity of movies such as Gravity, Interstellar or The Martian. A futuristic new TV drama series called The First, from House of Cards creator Beau Willimon, imagines the first human mission to Mars and interplanetary colonisation. There’s a new wave of public interest because the crossover between dreams and technology is enabling us to do things we could only imagine before.While sending people to Mars evokes much debate and excitement, last week brought news that Nasa had found complex organic matter suggesting that Martian lakes were once able to support life – but we cannot overestimate the extreme difficulty Mars expeditions involve. Even with just our most basic robots we fail on a regular basis. Since the 1960s there have been 28 failed Mars probes and only 19 successes. Mars is just so much farther away from Earth than most people think.Fundamentally, though we have everything we need to send humansto the red planet, we still don’t even know what we don’t know about exploring Mars. Would the journey alone involve so much cosmic radiation that it would be unthinkable? How are we going to navigate? How would we deal with the unknown vagaries of weather? And even if we got there, how would we survive? Think of this planet’s great explorations: between Magellan and Captain Cook, every long-distance crew got scurvy. It took two centuries before we finally figured out the science of why people were getting sick on long voyages. So in space exploration we have to send out probes, find a place that our technology allows us to live, and then slowly start moving there. But learning as we go to Mars presents so many extreme and ethical challenges that for me, the next logical step should instead be the moon. I would go so far as to say we now have a real chance of establishing lunar habitation. Earth’s satellite is only three days’ travel away. There is, of course, political opposition to such endeavour. Are we turning to other planets because we have run out of ideas for tackling climate change, pollution of the oceans and other catastrophes on our own? I think such arguments are both specious and inaccurate. Just because the place across the street is available (and Bezos has suggested that the moon could in 100 years’ time become a base for manufacturing) doesn’t mean you don’t have to tend your own garden.And true, the cost of space exploration is immense but that was true for Christopher Columbus as well. When John Cabot sailed out of England in 1496 he received government money and private industry money. He was just looking to explore. But it is that combination of a dream, coupled with established technology, and then funding sources from across the board, that made the travel possible. That’s been the pattern of our exploration throughout history, and it is being reflected now in space exploration.The beauty of a privately funded space mission is that decision making can be nimbler. You don’t have, as Nasa does, 350 million shareholders to please. I think involving the private sector is healthy, normal and the right thing to do. As Nasa has acknowledged, there needs to be a mix for the best chance of success.To get to the point where people start taking travel to the moon as much for granted as we do air travel will take an enormous amount of research and development, both in making the vehicles safer and in keeping the people who operate them safe. For most of my career I’ve worked to become a competent astronaut, trusted to fly a rocket ship, pilot a spaceship and command an international space station. Last year I was involved with the BBC show Astronauts: Do You Have What It Takes?, to let audiences see exactly what type of skills are required: a delicate combination of great technical ability, physical toughness, and psychological readiness.But beyond the astronauts, it will boil down to how much risk we as society are willing to take. Navigating space safely is extremely difficult. The Gemini and Apollo and early Soyuz years were fraught with risk and physical danger and we sadly lost lives. Thankfully, we are not willing to put people in harm’s way regularly.But the moon is now within our grasp. Not just to explore but actually to settle. And so the real question is this: can we build an environment where people can be healthy and happy and, most importantly, live? And I think the answer is yes.We have to find water resources on the moon, just like everywhere on Earth. We have to find a power source for when it’s cold. But as soon as a self-sustaining settlement is on the moon, then it’s just like a settlement anywhere. It becomes independent. It sounds far-fetched, but remember, we could not live in most of the world now were it not for technology. We couldn’t live in Canada. We could not survive winter in many places on Earth without knowing how to harness fire, build shelter, make clothing and process food. And technology will enable us to do things we’ve only dreamed of until recently.No one had ever been to New Zealand until just under a thousand years ago. No one had been to Antarctica till just over 100 years ago. And we only started venturing into space 60 years ago. Space settlement is both natural and, I believe, inevitable. The only questions are whether we can make it safe enough, and whether our technology can be made good enough. That’s where the undercurrent of excitement is, because the answer to those questions, finally, is yes.• Chris Hadfield is an astronaut.

It is broken down into various categories, with the 10 places for art, architecture and sculpture.All 10 have been selected by the BBC’s arts editor, Will Gompertz, from hundreds of nominations submitted by the public. There are two cathedrals on the list: St Paul’s in London and the Basil Spence-designed Coventry Cathedral, which was consecrated in 1962. The latter was a replacement for its 14th-century predecessor, which was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs in 1940.Gompertz called Coventry Cathedral “a magnificent, optimistic and bold response to the horrors of war”. He said: “To create a modern and ambitious building dedicated to spiritual enrichment from the literal ashes of destruction was – and is – a sublime answer to brutality. It is a building born out of love and hope, made from the rubble of hate and despair.”Sutton Hoo is the oldest place on the list. The burial mounds were first excavated in 1939. They revealed a 27 metre-long wooden ship buried with extraordinary treasures that helped rewrite understanding of the Anglo-Saxons.The excavated objects are on display at the British Museum and the Sutton Hoo site, looked after by the National Trust. “To look at them is to reach back and see our past made real and vital,” said Gompertz.The newest place on the list is Tate Modern in London, which opened in 2000. Gompertz, who was director of Tate Media before joining the BBC, said he knew every inch of the building, the former Bankside power station.“It is a wonderful space to show art and to welcome audiences from across the globe to mingle and learn together,” he said. “It breathed new life into a rundown part of London and introduced the world to a new way of showing and enjoying art.”The other galleries on the list are the Barbara Hepworth museum and sculpture park in St Ives and Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, praised by Gompertz as “without doubt, one of the finest examples of art in the landscape anywhere in the world”.Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North overlooking the A1 in Gateshead has become a popular national landmark since it was completed in 1998. Gompertz called it a powerful piece of contemporary sculpture that “excites, heralds and provokes”. He said: “It is so far removed from the typical ‘hero on a horse’ statues that are dotted across the country, invisible to all. Gormley’s artwork is as fresh as it is imposing.”Completing the new top 10 are Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, once the country home of William Morris Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, one of England’s grandest stately homes and the Minack theatre in Cornwall.All of the 10 places, chosen to stimulate debate, will be explored in depth in episodes of a podcast series created for the project, free on iTunes and Soundcloud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0737bcaa011ca967b4a4dac8dc47685f9714152a/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a228782dfd6efdef7f5818cd9dfd4eb","title":"universal basic income and rewilding can meet anthropocene demands","story":"Are we doomed to societal collapse? Not if we break the mould of ever-greater production and consumptionEnough concrete has been produced to cover the entire surface of the Earth in a layer two millimetres thick. Enough plastic has been manufactured to clingfilm it as well. We produce 4.8bn tonnes of our top five crops, plus 4.8 billion head of livestock, annually. There are 1.2bn motor vehicles, 2bn personal computers, and more mobile phones than the 7.5 billion people on Earth.The result of all this production and consumption is a chronic, escalating, many-sided environmental crisis. From rapid climate change to species extinctions to microplastics in every ocean, these impacts are now so large that many scientists have concluded that we have entered a new human-dominated geological period called the Anthropocene. This dangerous new epoch ends the unusually stable planetary conditions over the past 10,000 years that allowed farming and complex civilisations to emerge. With the spectre of rapid environmental change leading to societal collapse looming, what is to be done?Using modern science to reanalyse human history can help us understand future problems in more fundamental ways. Our analysis shows that just five successive types of human society have spread worldwide: hunter-gatherer, agriculturalist, mercantile capitalist, industrial capitalist and, following the second world war, today’s consumer capitalist society. Each subsequent stage relies on greater energy use and greater generation and flows of information and knowledge. These result in a much larger population, rising per capita productivity and greater collective agency. Seen in this light, a new sixth type of society will require both greater energy provision and improved systems to communicate knowledge and manage information. To usher in a new way of living, the core dynamic of ever-greater production and consumption of goods and resources must be broken, coupled with a societal focus on environmental repair. Two increasingly discussed ideas do just this. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a policy whereby a financial payment is made to every citizen, unconditionally, without any obligation to work, at a level above their subsistence needs. Small-scale trials of UBI show most people would still work, but UBI could break the link between work and consumption. We all do it, saying: “I work so hard, I deserve that fancy meal, new gadget, or long-haul flight.” Consumption is the payback for being ever-more productive at work. Indeed, it makes little sense to curb consumption when we know we will have to be ever-more productive at work regardless of our choices. UBI reduces dependency, giving people the agency to say no to undesirable work, and yes to opportunities that often lie out of reach. With UBI we could all think long-term, well beyond the next payday. We could care for ourselves, others, and the wider world, as living in the Anthropocene demands.Another idea is Half-Earth – the simple but profound idea that environmental repair could come fromallocating half the Earth’s surface primarily for the benefit of other species. Half-Earth is less utopian than it first appears, as we have become an urban species. Mass-scale forest restoration is already underway, with commitments across 43 countries to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest, 10 times the area of the UK. And at a deeper level, our views on nature are forged by the society we live in. Acknowledging the Anthropocene re-establishes that humans are part of nature, and so rewilding projects, where large areas are managed to allow natural processes to run, are increasingly popular. Slowly, a new nature aesthetic is being born. But can we really escape booming production and consumption? The fate of species encountering vast new resources is exponential growth and then collapse, epitomised by the rapid expansion and eventual death of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. While rarely recognised, we humans have recently become the exception to this rule: birth rates on all continents are declining and the global population is on track to stabilise. More information, in the form of girls’ education, has done something truly extraordinary in the context of 4bn years of life. UBI would give people the right to choose when it comes to fulfilling their own basic needs, and rewilding Earth does the same of other species’ needs. This would be a legacy of a new chapter in Earth’s history that we could be proud of.

Can the ’s style squad change things?The first time I went on the BBC’s Question Time, in February 2012, I wanted to make a decent impression. The fact that I looked like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone wouldn’t play in my favour – on my Twitter feed, people regularly queried whether I was taking time off from my paper round when I appeared on TV. But my then flatmate Liam took pity, and promised to leave out a special, smart-looking shirt.I found it laid out for me in our flat, and felt much more confident when I put it on. Fashion was not my forte, but at least, I thought, I had made a real effort. There I was in Nottingham, with big political beasts including John Prescott and Ken Clarke on the panel with me and, for a change, I had made a concession to expectations. It went well. Afterwards I called Liam to thank him. “But Owen,” he protested, “you didn’t take the shirt, you took my girlfriend’s blouse.”It’s fair to say that clothes are not my thing. If you need evidence, here it is: in 2016, GQ magazine named me the ninth-worst-dressed man in Britain – worse than Chris Evans. Growing up closeted near the centre of Stockport, I did everything I could to blend in – a massive dollop of gel, hair combed forward, Kappa tracksuits before graduating to Ben Sherman shirts – then, with a hint of teenage rebellion, I bleached my hair and pierced my eyebrow. I looked like a boyband reject, basically. Unfortunately, when I came out at the age of 20 (originally as bisexual, ruining it for genuine bis by fuelling the whole “bi now gay later” shtick), I was not magically endowed with a set of gay skills such as “being spontaneously sassy” or “having a great wardrobe”. A female friend said to me: “Oh great, now we can go shopping together!” But I hate shopping. I have nightmares about shopping.Thirteen years later, watching the Netflix show Queer Eye is a joy: here’s a show in which five queer men come to the rescue of mostly straight men, who are often imprisoned by their unreconstructed masculinity and struggling to find genuine happiness as a consequence. They teach them how to cook, groom, do up their homes, talk about their feelings and, yes, dress. Before I watched the show – a reboot of the early-00s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy – I worried that it would reduce gay men to this season’s amusing must-have accessories. It always struck me when I was growing up that the portrayal of gay men on television was either as one-dimensional, desexualised camp clowns as the butt of jokes or as would-be sexual predators. But Queer Eye upends all this. I fell in love with the show, and every one of the fab five, instantly. One of my favourites is Jonathan Van Ness, a hairdresser who unashamedly embraces camp: an important role model for gay men who all too often fetishise being “straight acting” (as I once did) and can be horribly prejudiced to those deemed camp. I wish my younger self could have watched a show featuring gay men as superheroes, coming to help straight men struggling with their own heterosexuality.Frankly, though, I’m a proud queer man who needs as much assistance as any of the straight men in the show. I may no longer care about how “gay” I’m judged to be, but I have developed no interest in clothes whatsoever. That’s not uncommon, by the way, among people attracted to members of the same gender who depart from heterosexual norms. Gay, I’m afraid, is not a synonym for sharp dresser.So it was suggested to me by my colleagues that perhaps I could use some styling that there could be an afternoon at  HQ that would amount to straight eye for the queer guy. I was a little apprehensive. Spending an afternoon trying on clothes normally strikes me as about as enjoyable as a night out with Ukip’s youth wing. Fortunately, fashion queen Jess Cartner-Morley and stylist Helen Seamons could see I was nervous, and put me at ease.I turned up wearing a grey hoodie and jeans – standard – and worried they would have got in gold-lined Prada shirts. It wasn’t just the inevitable Twitter storm – CLOTHES LOVING SOCIALIST HYPOCRITE!!! – that I was worried about I also have an aversion to splashing out more than, say, £50 on a shirt. Anything more just seems like a surrender to rampant commercialism. Thankfully, they had thought about all that, and as I eyed up the clothes, I was reassured that none were more than a notch up from high-street prices. I was relieved that I could imagine myself wearing any of them – other than a bright pink Hawaiian shirt that was a bit midlife crisis.Wow, I thought after putting on the first set, I’m wearing clothes that actually fit, rather than throwing on some random crumpled shirt hidden under a generic grey jumper before debating a rightwing thinktanker on Sky News. Some of them I quite liked: a swanky green jacket and a navy blue suit that made me look almost respectable. The bright red T-shirt needs a contrast button, and one of the jacket and trouser combos made me look like a not-very-hench bouncer. Throughout, Helen kept skilfully adjusting the clothes, and jokey patter with her and Jess made an otherwise slightly absurd scenario tolerable. I’m not going to lie, though: it was not me.I guess my perspective on clothes has always been: this is really superficial why should anyone care when I go on TV I’m just trying to get my opinion across, how I look is irrelevant. But this is a bit naive. Perhaps it shouldn’t matter, but it does. Leftwingers are at an automatic disadvantage because they are arguing for a radical departure from the current order therefore, how they present themselves matters. Demanding a crackdown on tax avoidance while wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt will probably attract raised eyebrows more than anything else. It’s OK to look smart and rail against injustice. I’m told some revolutionary sects – such as Militant, of which my late father was a member – encouraged their members to avoid dressing like a radical. John Prescott, meanwhile, has talked of attending Oxford’s Ruskin College as a working-class trade unionist: “I remember our first lecture, all the middle-class guys turned up in their revolutionary gear, we turned up in our suits.”Last year, I did a photoshoot for GQ to accompany an interview: they didn’t tell me the suit they had asked me to wear was worth £1,000, but several rightwing blogs certainly found out. “Owen Jones discusses the ‘crisis of capitalism’ in a £1,000 jacket,” crowed the Spectator. But actually – even though I didn’t own the jacket – this patronises so many young working-class people who (unlike me) pride themselves on what they wear, and often save up for months to splash out on designer items.When my  colleagues asked me to do a photoshoot as a gay man who doesn’t exude style, I was a bit bemused. But, weirdly, I quite enjoyed wearing clothes that looked good and fit me. I doubt I will be crowned Britain’s most stylish man any time soon. But there’s nothing wrong with priding yourself on how you look it turns out it doesn’t make you some superficial bourgeois traitor. Don’t expect me to start embracing Gucci socialism, but maybe I’ll stop treating shopping as a slightly less enjoyable exercise than dental surgery. You can want to change the world without looking like a dishevelled paper boy.GQ were way harsh. Helen and I agree on that, looking through photos of pre-makeover Owen. He’s a good-looking man, he just needs sharpening up a bit. The logic behind his trademark shirt-and-jumper look is that instead of ironing a shirt he puts a jumper over the top to hide the creases. Often, part of the shirt collar is sticking up, or has got tucked inside the jumper, so you can tell he didn’t look in the mirror before going on camera. That tells you everything about what Owen thinks about clothes – he doesn’t.Owen looks relieved that the clothes Helen wants him to wear aren’t flamboyant. “A style overhaul isn’t about wearing lots of colour,” she explains. “In fact, keeping to a minimal palette will help you look sharp.” The idea is professional and presentable, rather than suited and booted. Black jeans that have faded to grey are swapped for dark Japanese-look denim. A smarter shoe takes a jeans-based outfit out of Student Union territory a smart bomber jacket pulls a look together in a way that Owen’s grey hoodie doesn’t. Detail is key: Helen turns up jeans, rolls up T-shirt sleeves, quietly but firmly warns him off lumpily stuffing pockets with phones and keys.I suspect fashion may never be a passion of Owen’s, but the reality of life in the public eye is that clothes are noticed, and judged, whether you like it or not. So it makes sense to try to control, or at least be aware of, the messages you are giving out. Our shoot is tightly sandwiched between speaking engagements – one about Erdoğan, one about Gaza – but when Helen tells Owen the stores these clothes came from (Arket, Cos, new online brand FoR) he writes the names down on his phone for future reference, and I don’t think he’s just doing it to be polite. I don’t think we converted Owen to the fashion cause. But I hope we made him realise we’re not the enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e9952f513c2bead0c50766bc120d5e8b6b5155/0_100_2650_1590/master/2650.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e8aac73062db9e3208d527a68f26c2","title":"world cup 2018 how to get the most from the guardian","story":"All you need to know about the ’s interactives, live coverage, star columnists and moreA trio of star players have joined the  and Observer for World Cup coverage which is more live, interactive and international than ever before.Here are a few pointers about how to find the best content online and in print from the sports website and sports newspaper of the year.

They argue that most of the images that come top in search almost exclusively feature young, slim white women, which only represents a fraction of female football fans.This Fan Girl is an online community dedicated to female supporters, made up of photographer Amy Drucquer and her team, who visit stadiums around the UK to capture images of female fans in attendance at matches. Their gallery of images show a erse range of women, young and old, on their way to watch football. Drucquer says: “This is something we’ve felt passionately about since we first started taking photos of female football fans. We’re excited to work on the We Are Female Fans campaign to affect tangible and visible change.”Carabao’s Anna Cooke says that: “This week the World Cup will kick off and be watched by millions of fans, male and female, yet it won’t be long before the cameras are focusing gratuitously on female fans in the crowd and soon those images will feature online. Our campaign wants to tackle this and profile all female football fans, whatever their age, shape or size.”For the World Cup campaign five images of a erse group of female England fans at Wembley have been produced, and supporters are being encouraged to share stories about #WeAreFemaleFans in order to try and push these pictures up search rankings to displace the images currently displayed.As well as the Carabao Cup, the energy drink company sponsors several women’s teams, including Chelsea Ladies, Reading Women and Abingdon United WFC, and the mission to change the search results is also supported by Chelsea Ladies’ Katie Chapman, who says: “Players come from a wide range of backgrounds, but I’m sure we’d all agree that we’re football fans first and foremost. I support the We Are Female Fans campaign as a fantastic step towards more erse representation of female football.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c904e5e6ce6d087445eef06c877e2122a3838f/167_502_5516_3309/master/5516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=789e87edab4302209652fd26951ff4e4","title":"julio dely valdes panama world cup weve taken giant leap","story":"Panama’s greatest ever player discusses what it means for them to be at the World Cup, four years after narrowly missing outHe had seen them sobbing four years earlier and now he watched in silence as the tears returned, but it was different this time. Román Torres had just scored the late, late goal that took Panama to the World Cup for the first time in their history 5,000 miles away, the country’s finest ever footballer was watching on television, struggling to contain his emotion. “I couldn’t shout as much as I would have liked because I was in Spain and it was the middle of the night: I would have woken the neighbours,” Julio Dely Valdés says, laughing. “It’s hard to explain the feeling was immense. I knew what they’d been through.”Few could grasp quite like him what this meant. Dely Valdés played in Argentina, Uruguay, France, Italy and Spain, but never at the World Cup. His older brother Armando, who died in 2001, played in Argentina, Uruguay and Israel and had a stadium in Colón named in his honour. And Julio’s twin Jorge followed him to Argentina then Uruguay’s Nacional, before playing in Chile and Japan. Julio, with 44 caps and 15 goals, and Jorge retired from international football together in October 2005. Julio scored over 120 goals at Paris Saint-Germain, Cagliari, Oviedo and Málaga of Panama’s likely squad this summer a few are in Europe – Slovenia and Romania, and in the B teams of Deportivo la Coruña and Gent. Yet this generation has achieved something unthinkable when he played.Only, it is his generation too these are his players, and he embarked on this journey with them. It took an 87th-minute goal to take Panama to the World Cup at the expense of the USA in 2018 in 2014 they had been denied the chance to go to a World Cup play-off by a last-minute goal from the USA. Julio Dely Valdés was their coach, Jorge his assistant. Most of the players from back then will be in Russia, redemption delivered. “The dressing room that day …” Dely Valdés starts saying. He stops, puffs out his cheeks. “Sad,” he adds, slowly. “All around the room were people sobbing.”Dely Valdés became Panama manager in 2006, basically because there was no one else. “They’d sacked the coach, there were two games coming up and it was like: ‘Julio can do it.’ My second game we went to Peru, where we’d never won, where we’d been beaten 7-0, and won 0-2. ‘Ooh!’ Hahaha. ‘What’s going on here?’ So, I stayed and took charge for five games, before going to Spain.”Dely Valdés tells the story of the team bus leaving without Luis Tejada, the star striker, who didn’t show up and was left out. Although he returned later and, aged 36 now, will be in Russia, the way Dely Valdés tells it, that was an important battle won. When it came to the biggest battle, though, the moment they could have made history, they lost, qualification for 2014 dramatically denied.“Sadly, we had to go through that,” Dely Valdés, 51, says. “But, then, maybe we needed to go through that. It made the national team stronger. Having had it so, so close … then so far. It was the 91st minute when America scored and they weren’t playing for anything, but we lost the game, eh. We did. We were the ones that didn’t know how to manage the situation.“That game will always be in my head, it’s still going around. Four days before, you play Mexico and lose in the last minute so you’ve got the experience, you’ve been warned. Then we play the US, we’re winning 1-0 at half-time and I tell the players: ‘Remember this: there will be a time when we’ll need to be behind the ball, every one of us, defending to the death.’ The US equalise, we go 2-1 up. It’s the 80th minute, you’re winning 2-1, you have to think: ‘This is that moment.’ But when we scored to make it 2-1, the players were crying. We were like: ‘It’s not finished! You’ve got a World Cup place, but you have to protect it with your life.’”“This should be the start of something: Panama at the World Cup! We’ve taken a giant leap, it’s the country’s biggest sport now, and we have to keep building. I’ll be going to Russia with my family, wearing the shirt. I’m going to enjoy it the whole of Panama will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440d9623c83554538803b8fe32d776a19abd535/0_113_2938_1763/master/2938.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff5e46d3f2672aa38926e729842025d8","title":"piotr zielinski polands playmaker tipped to be the next kevin de bruyne","story":"His Euro 2016 campaign ended with him sobbing in the changing rooms but he has grown to be Poland’s creative starThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.As the second half of Poland’s Euro 2016 match against Ukraine began, a heartbroken Piotr Zielinski sat crying in the Stade Vélodrome dressing room. The manager, Adam Nawalka, had substituted him after an anonymous 45 minutes in their final group stage game only the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had completed fewer passes than him in the first half which is never a good sign for a playmaker. They were Zielinski’s first and last minutes at the tournament.Two years later Zieliński goes to the World Cup as Poland’s big hope. The playing-time situation has improved dramatically – only Robert Lewandowski had more time on the pitch in qualifying – and Zielinski is on a different level now, both in terms of confidence and the qualities he offers the team.Zielinski’s journey to international football began in his family’s garden in the small town of Zabkowice Slaskie. He polished his technique there from a very young age, competing with his older brother Pawel in games and challenges invented by their father Boguslaw.It was a typical family home, but not a typical family unit. Boguslaw and his wife Beata, opened a foster home and as well as their own three sons – Piotr, Pawel and Tomek – the couple took in four other children. Eight year old Piotr initially struggled to accept strangers in his house. He felt threatened to the point where he started to mark his territory: “Piotr’s bed”, “Piotr’s desk”, “Piotr’s wardrobe”. It took years, but step by step he started to feel more comfortable with the situation, talking with his new friends and playing football with them. Over time, it helped shape him into a sensitive and compassionate young man. Now, with the financial resources of an international footballer, he has bought buildings in Zabkowice and nearby Targowica, which his parents have converted into two children’s homes.Zielinski was little more than a child when he came to the attention of a Udinese scout in 2011. “He was that good I didn’t even know if he was left- or right-footed,” remembers Andrea Carnevale. “Pure talent with a lot of class in how he moved around the pitch. He was the youngest in the group but shone bright.” Udinese invited him to Italy and needed only a few training sessions to be persuaded to buy him from Zaglebie Lubin. A two-year loan spell at Empoli saw him bloom and it was early 2016, with Zielinski now 21 years old, when Jürgen Klopp called. The player had been on his radar for a while, and good reviews from his former Borussia Dortmund players Jakub Blaszczykowski and Lukasz Piszczek had piqued the Liverpool manager’s interest. Klopp decided to act, inviting Zielinski and his agent Bartlomiej Bolek to the north-west of England.Zielinski was ready to move to the Premier League but Udinese had other plans. The then-Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri, with whom he had worked during his spell at Empoli, was determined to take him to the Stadio San Paolo. Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentis promptly used his connections at Udinese, and Zielinski became a Napoli player for €16m. “He will be the next Kevin De Bruyne,” said Sarri.He’s no longer the Piotr who cried during Euro 2016, nor does he care about critics much anymore. He can bear the weight of responsibility and is more effective on the pitch. That was evident during the qualifiers, in which he had a crucial impact with six assists, and he finally scored his first goal under Nawalka in the March friendly against South Korea. Zielinski knows he has to be mentally strong now. More and more people look at him and expect him big things, so he has worked with the sports psychologist Kamil Wodka, who also helps Piszczek and the triple Olympic ski jumping champion Kamil Stoch. “I am a fast runner but Piotr is a very fast thinker,” says his Poland team-mate Kamil Grosicki. “Great technique, knows exactly where to put a ball, predicts what can happen and chooses the best solution like a chess player. He can give us a lot in Russia. He’s the biggest talent in Poland.”And Klopp still has his name in a notepad. Zielinski, still 24, has a buyout clause of €60m in his Napoli contract, which should not prove much of a deterrent for a determined Premier League club. De Laurentis has already put a new deal on the table but a successful tournament in Russia could change Zielinski’s future. He will marry his fiancee, Laura Slowik, shortly after returning home and perhaps a new partnership is on the cards in his professional life, too.Tomasz Wlodarczyk writes for Przegląd Sportowy.Follow him on Twitter here.

I just feel like I’m going to be happier arguing about VAR than about nerve agentIn 2012, the Pointless host Richard Osman conceived the World Cup of Crisps, in which 32 big-hitting varieties of crisp were pitted against each other in group stages, all decided by Twitter polls. Thereafter, the winners proceeded to knockout stages, meeting in quarter-finals, before progressing to – well, I believe you are familiar with this general format.Osman has since expanded the idea to the World Cup of Chocolate, and a book called The World Cup of Everything, which invites readers to stage their own hotly contested tournaments between the weightiest competitors in the fields of such things as bands, animals, biscuits and so on.I have never game-theorised a World Cup of My World Cup Lies but in a way that particular tournament happens every four years anyway, whether I want it to or not. I have simply yet to formalise it. Which of my grandest self-deceptions would win? Well, clearly, a lot depends on the draw. For instance, I wouldn’t like “I honestly don’t get emotional about England anymore” to be drawn in the same group as “I don’t secretly find it a release once England crash out”. It would be too early for them to meet.See also “I never make jokes based on lazy prejudices regarding national character” and “I especially never do this out of thinly disguised jealously that the nation in question is better at football than us”. I mean, I could go on. “I have never attempted to make an in-game football bargain with a god I otherwise know doesn’t exist.” “I am happy for Germany’s success.”Oh, the things you tell yourself. Or the things I tell myself, at any rate. I’m sure you’re much purer, much less hypocritical and much less of a terrible person than me. Especially when you’re on the internet.But on a personal note, the World Cup is a quadrennial chance to be reminded of my own shallows and self-delusions. I can feel it in those moments of worshipping – literally and wholly loving – a player I despise at club level, for putting England through in the last minute with some scrappy, flukey, comically undeserved goal I basically know is only deferring the agony to come.At the same time, the psychic pall of the England shirt traditionally gets too much even for those of us not having to wear it. It’s all rather too tired and emotional, eventually, like some toxic family Christmas that’s gone on too long. There is a kind of relief and freshly laundered feel to a tournament once England have inevitably buggered off out of it. Think of it as “the reset”.Thereafter I switch to indulging one of the other World Cup lies I tell myself: namely, that I’m a proper sporting purist who is now genuinely happy to simply be watching great international sides that are not my own make their electrifying progress toward a trophy I am absolutely relaxed about England never winning again.Those are just the printable lies but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Instead, set your sights on adventure, as we contemplate Russia 2018 – what could be your last 32-team World Cup!Obviously, I cannot wait for it to start. Not least because, given various developing news stories relating to our hosts, the tournament has rather ghastlier noises-off than usual. I just feel like I’m going to be happier arguing about VAR than about nerve agent.Then again, it’s fair to say the opening game – Russia v Saudi Arabia – is not the “prospect to salivate over” of footballing cliche. On the one hand, the two countries are engaged in a version of proxy war in Syria. On the other, they’ve formed a strategic alliance on energy. Either way, Vladimir Putin will be in attendance. As for further presidential cameos at a tournament he has spent almost £9bn on, despite being not that into it … Well, according to a Kremlin spokesman’s most recent update, “everything will depend on how things go”.This feels like a remark of unsettling vagueness when applied to Putin. The Russian president used his last sporting mega-event as a curtain raiser to invading Crimea, so it is to be hoped this “how things go” is a reference to Russia’s progress through the group stages of the football World Cup, as opposed to any potential sudden developments in Russia’s role in the conflict in Syriathe investigation into the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisburythe investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential electionany other of the crazy shit the Russian president’s currently into.So yes, as I say – it does help once the actual football gets underway. And the actual fibbing. The lying – the sweet, sweet self-delusion – is really the key to it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5400216c63feb4c5af11a9f11cbd2bc8209d4c/0_158_4539_2724/master/4539.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eb4b3ed5387888d4ee8cb59e4f10818","title":"world cup 2018 russia football news england fly out live","story":"When England land, they’ll be heading straight for the not so acclaimed ForRestMix resort in Repino, where Sky Sports News are already parked outside.

They had six children and saved for years to build a home of their own. But in 2014 Yalivenda was shot dead by Seleka rebels. His family seized the couple’s house and other possessions.“After my husband was killed, I was kicked out of our house by his parents,” says Sambelle. “The parents of my husband said ‘all this property, it is not for you. It belongs to the members of our family’.”In Central African Republic (CAR), when a man dies, his widow is sometimes evicted from their home and land by her husband’s relatives – a practice that is illegal in most cases. The toll that this dispossession takes on a woman and her children is amplified by a brutal conflict, a lack of social safety nets and diminishing family ties.The underlying motivation for evicting widows is greed, says Rosalie Nguitimale, president of the Kémo prefecture branch of the Organisation of Central African Women (OFCA).“The purpose is just to take all the property,” she says. The husband’s family usually confiscate items such as motorcycles, farming implements, beds, clothes, TVs, savings, and anything else that catches their eye.Sambelle has struggled to accept the theft. “When my husband was alive we farmed together, we sold the crops, and then we shared our fortune with his parents and other relatives. The money that we earned is what allowed us to build the house,” she says. “I was so disappointed when my relatives-in-law took it from us.”In the parts of CAR not controlled by armed groups, weak state institutions mean these women do not receive any support. With nowhere else to turn, many try to move back in with their parents or another relative, says Emma Ouayagalé Yeo, a technical coordinator at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which runs a programme to assist widows in Sibut, 181km north-east of the capital Bangui. But with more than 1.2 million people displaced by the conflict, Ouayagalé says the women often find the family home destroyed or occupied by others, or their families are unable to support them because they too are affected by the conflict.Factors including illiteracy, a dysfunctional judicial system, and a lack of awareness of their rights mean widows don’t press for fair legal settlements. According to CAR’s family code, property acquired during a marriage belongs to both spouses (with some exceptions) and a widow is entitled to half the estate and is allowed to continue living in the home for at least two years. In Sibut, the OFCA and NRC try to mediate. “When such cases occur, we try to gather people together in order to convince them not to kick the widow out by force. People don’t want to listen to us, but they usually calm down after these interventions and we have been successful at preventing recent evictions,” says Nguitimale.Evictions sometimes involve a drawn-out campaign of verbal and emotional abuse that eventually forces the woman to leave. Children are not safeguarded, says Ouayagalé. Three months after Charlotte Mbetilissio’s husband, Daniel Gazaworo, was killed in 2014, she was kicked out of her home by his family along with her three children, now aged 18, five and four.“When Gilbert was alive, he gave food to the extended family. But when he died … I could no longer give anything to them,” says Mbetilissio. “They said ‘you have to move, leave this home, you constitute a burden upon us’. Even the children I had made with their son were pushed away when they wanted to eat with their grandparents.”Mbetilissio’s youngest son, Félicien, needs blood transfusions. “When I take him to the hospital, I am supposed to pay for the blood unit.

However, Tesco will take the greener South African lemons earlier than usual to avoid gaps in its supply.“These greener lemons that we now have on sale are already mature and perfect tasting inside but need longer for the skin to turn yellow,” said Tesco’s citrus fruit buyer Savia Weidinger-Reich. “With the South African crop, that happens towards the end of June as evenings cool, which helps the fruit to colour. The move not only means that shoppers will again be easily able to buy a fruit that is growing in popularity, but they will gain extra freshness.”The greener lemons – the same price as regular yellow ones – are unlikely to be confused with limes as they have the more distinctive, elongated shape of lemons.

Is he the only one left in Britain? By  Patrick BarkhamWe cannot speak of its loneliness, but it must be Britain’s most solitary animal. For the last 16 years, every winter, a male greater mouse-eared bat has taken up residence 300 metres inside a disused and exceedingly damp railway tunnel in West Sussex. The greater mouse-eared bat has been all but extinct in this country for decades. This is the only remaining one we know of. The future of the species in Britain appears to rest with one long-lived and very distinctive inidual.The greater mouse-eared bat is so large that observers who first discovered it in Britain likened one to a young rabbit hanging from a wall. In flight, its wings can stretch to nearly half a metre – an astonishing spectacle in a land where bats are generally closer to the size of the rodent that inspired their old name: flittermouse.The bat has large, mouse-like ears and its feeding habits are as striking as its size. Rather than zig-zagging through darkening skies collecting flying insects, like most bats, Myotis myotis descends earthwards, flapping its wings very slowly as it covers the ground, picking up grasshoppers, crickets, dung beetles and other flightless insects as it goes. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey.The solitary inidual who spends the winters in West Sussex has never been observed in flight. Where it goes each spring is not known, and what it does is not known, nor which other animals, if any, it encounters. All that is known is that each winter the bat faithfully returns to its dark tunnel, where it hangs, almost motionless, for five months. This place of winter rest is a closely guarded secret, for the bat’s select band of self-appointed s are adamant: there can be no repeat of the scenes of 1957. That year, a live colony had been found inside an old mine on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. Although a reasonably familiar sight in southern Europe, where large colonies roost in caves, this was the first time a greater mouse-eared bat had been found in Britain. The Times published photographs, and a media frenzy ensued. Several animals were whisked out of hibernation and transported to TV and photographic studios and filmed for weeks before being returned to their hibernation hole. Disturbing bats mid-hibernation can kill them. Money was also offered for dead specimens and collectors spirited iniduals away.This fascination was fatal: the greater mouse-eared bat was barely seen again in Dorset, apart from reports of “very large, broad-winged bats” in an appropriately gothic setting: flying around Corfe Castle. Although another small colony of greater mouse-eared bats was found in West Sussex in the late 1960s, by 1992 the species was declared extinct in Britain, the first mammal to disappear from our shores since the wolf 250 years ago.Bats fly beneath our radar. While butterfly sightings have been collected for 400 years and birds have been scientifically monitored for more than 70 years, bats only been systematically counted for less than two decades. Little is known about many of Britain’s 18 bat species, some of which exist in perilously low numbers. Today they are threatened perhaps more than they’ve ever been by the loss of their insect prey, the conversion of old barns and derelict buildings in which they roost, and the bright lights of new suburbs, wind farms and speeding vehicles that bamboozle or kill them.The unexpected reappearance of the greater mouse-eared bat in its West Sussex tunnel, in 2002, was a symbol of hope. Against the odds, bats are surviving in our human-dominated land and, perhaps more than any other wild animal, they are constantly surprising us.Bats are great survivors. The oldest known fossil of a bat, found in a quarry in Wyoming in 2003, is about 52.5m years old. Bats have been evolving for so long, and with so many specialised attributes, from echolocation to drastically extended forelimbs, that the order of Chiroptera – “winged hands” in Latin – accounts for one in five species of mammal. They are supremely successful animals. As one expert puts it: when you have been evolving for so long, you’ve perfected the business of being a bat.That business is becoming tricker in a human-dominated world. In older times, they were feared and despised. Modern people may be more tolerant, but even beneficent parts of society – from harvesters of renewable energy to vicars – are often hostile to bats. Energy-efficient homes seal up roof spaces where bats once roosted. New roads – and the planned route of the HS2 railway – block traditional foraging routes. LED lighting is particularly disturbing for bats. Wind farms chop them up: according to a study published in 2016, researchers using sniffer dogs to find and retrieve bat carcasses calculated that 29 onshore windfarms killed 194 dead bats per month – a kill-rate that would dispatch 80,000 bats a year across Britain, without accounting for migrating bats taken out by the rapidly expanding rows of offshore turbines.Earlier this year, members of the House of Lords spoke in favour of a bill that seeks to remove bats’ legal protection in churches unless there is a “significant” adverse impact on rare bat populations. The Bishop of Norwich blamed barn conversions for driving bats into churches, with more than half of 12,000 listed churches housing roosts of bats. Worshippers had “come to the end of their tether,” warned the bishop, because of bat droppings despoiling brasses, fabrics and fittings. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Movement Against Bats in Churches – founded by a vicar’s wife – campaigned to eliminate the blight of bats. Is there another animal in Britain that has a dedicated protest movement against it?Bats that overcome these challenges can live a long time. Only 19 mammal species are longer-lived relative to their body size than humans, and all but one of these are bats. (The other is the naked mole rat.) And of these unusually durable mammals, the greater mouse-eared bat is one of the longest-lived of all: it can clock up more than 35 years. Scientists recently discovered that its longevity is probably due to the fact that, unlike most mammals, its telomeres – a string-like material at the end of its chromosomes – do not shorten with age. They hope further insights from the unique biology of Myotis myotis may one day help humans live longer.Time passes in a different way for such a long-lived animal, and so it seems with its s. I first contacted natural scientist and bat expert Tony Hutson in early 2017, and it was more than a year before he agreed to take me to see the bat. Hutson, a retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, is wary of any interference in the creature’s peaceful existence. Each month of winter, Hutson and other local recorders count the bats hibernating in several old railway tunnels, and each month I begged to be allowed to tag along. After the bat was inspected without me in December, January and February, finally Hutson agreed that I could accompany them on an extra trip they would undertake in March, with a big caveat: they didn’t normally inspect the bat so late in winter, and could not guarantee it would still be hanging there.Hutson is the second in a short lineage of champions of the greater mouse-eared bat. The first was a wildlife-loving tea-planter from Ceylon called Captain William Watt Addison Phillips. Phillips grew up in Staffordshire during the reign of Queen Victoria, and headed to Colombo to become a tea-planter when he was 19. Living among the civets, leopards and sloth bears of Ceylon, he catalogued its natural history and published papers including “On the habits of the Ceylon Gerbil”.After retiring, Phillips conducted a survey of the flora and fauna of the Males for the Natural History Museum before settling in Bognor Regis in 1959, just after the first greater mouse-eared bat frenzy. Phillips remained active and insatiably curious in retirement, taking an interest in every kind of animal and plant around him. He was also lucky: one day he found a grey long-eared bat – Britain’s second-rarest species – sprawled on his dustbin. It was dead. Some years later, Phillips explored some derelict railway tunnels in Sussex with his grandson. In one, they were delighted to discover a small colony of greater mouse-eared bats. Bearing in mind the old shooting aficionado’s adage, “What hits is history, what’s missed is mystery,” Phillips shouldered his gun, brought down a couple and donated the specimens to the eager curators of the Natural History Museum, who added them to their collections.At the time, Tony Hutson was working as a scientific researcher in the museum and, by chance, had already met Bill Phillips a few years earlier, during an expedition to the Males. Hutson had first become fascinated by bats as a boy, when he saw them above an old priory. He was particularly gripped when he first witnessed the mystery of their motionless hibernation. “That got me – that they will sit there without moving for three or four months,” he says. “How are they doing nothing?” Growing up in south London, he joined a natural history youth group that met at the Natural History Museum as a young man, he applied for a job there. He had a cup of tea with a secretary and asked if he could help its scientists who were studying bats. “They said: ‘No, but we can give you a job in entomology.’” So Hutson cunningly pursued his passion by studying the ectoparasites – such as fleas – that live on bats.As one of the museum’s bat experts, Hutson spent much of his time coaxing irate homeowners not to destroy colonies of rare bats roosting in their roofs. But there were moments of adventure, too. He undertook an expedition to a cave in Ecuador with Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author of Chariots of the Gods, who believed that aliens visited Earth and influenced early human culture. The explorers were winched into the cave by helicopter and the astronaut Neil Armstrong came along. “The theory was that if we did meet any aliens, he would be the best person for them to talk to,” said Hutson. He found no aliens, but they did come across a few interesting bat species.After taking note of Bill Phillips’ surprising discovery of a colony of greater mouse-eared bats in Sussex, Hutson first visited the old railway tunnels in 1974, and saw the bats for himself. “I was working with ectoparasites of bats at the time, so I’d sometimes come down and poke a few around, searching for parasites,” he said. The tunnel was bricked up, with a locked door at one end, to stop visitors from causing a repeat of the scenes that destroyed the Dorset population in the 1950s. (The bats gained access via ventilation grills.) Each year in the 1980s, Hutson unlocked the door and counted the greater mouse-eared bats inside. Each year, their numbers dwindled. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 gave bats and their roosts legal protection for the first time, but then, disaster: one winter, all the female greater mouse-eared bats disappeared from the tunnel. It seemed that their maternity roost – the barn or some other unknown place in Britain where the females raised their young during the summer – must have been destroyed, perhaps in a fire, or by developers. By 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat was declared extinct.But Tony Hutson did not give up. Each winter, he continued to check tunnels and disused mines all over the south of England. Nine years later, his vigilance was vindicated. He heard reports of a live bat found, grounded, in Bognor, and raced to the seaside town. By the time he arrived, this old female bat had died. And it presented another puzzle: it was disabled.“A bat’s forearms are usually the same length, but on this bat they were different lengths,” he remembered. “Whether it spent its life flying around in circles, I’m not sure.” Was there a secret, residual population of mouse-eared bats? It appeared not, for this venerable female showed no sign of ever having bred, and no sign of having communed with any other mouse-eared bats. “There were no parasites on it that it would have picked up from others of its kind, which is what I was looking for,” said Hutson. But the find put him on high alert.At the end of 2002, his annual inspection of the old tunnel where the bats had been found by Captain Bill Phillips in the 1960s revealed a single greater mouse-eared bat. It was a young male, born that spring. Hutson and the protectors placed a silver tag on its elbow and wondered how this species would surprise them next.By March, I was desperate to see this bat. I met Hutson on a murky day in a layby close to the secret tunnel. He had been visiting the bat each month over winter, but offered no crumb of comfort. “Whether he flew off last night, I don’t know,” he said with a twitch of deadpan humour. We set off through a woodland with some fellow bat enthusiasts: Crispin Scott of the National Trust, and Sue Harris and Martin Phillis, volunteer bat recorders for Sussex bat group and part of a network of bat fans who form the Bat Conservation Trust. This small charity is the national voice for bats in Britain, and Hutson revealed, with characteristic modesty, that he helped set it up.We walked down the cutting of an old railway line, sharp lumps of chalk and fallen trees tumbling down the banks. The tiniest trace of people having walked along the cutting worried the protectors. “It’s too open,” said Scott. “We need to fell a couple of trees across here so only people in the know come down.” At the end was a tunnel of red brick, marching into the hillside.At the centre of its bricked-up entrance was an iron hatch. Phillis pulled out a key, unlocked the top and the bottom, and we squeezed inside. The tunnel was cool but not freezing dark but not pitch-black. Daylight shone from the grille above our heads and in the far distance, like a mirage, was a crescent of light, another grille, 680 metres away, at the tunnel’s end.I hadn’t anticipated the water. There was the sound of constant dripping as water oozed through the brick ceiling and hit the stony floor. The bricks glistened with moisture. “Bats need it very humid,” said Hutson. “If it gets too dry, they dehydrate.” There were black stains on curved tunnel walls and ceiling. Only when we later emerged and discovered our faces were streaked with black did I realise that this was archeological soot, from the steam trains that last entered this tunnel in the 1950s.The bat protectors wielded head and hand torches and began by painstakingly sweeping their beams up and down the curved walls of the tunnel, inspecting ginger-coloured fungi, straggly like beards, and searching for the bats that clung in crevices where mortar or brickwork had come away. Different species shared this tunnel. Smaller species may temporarily wake from hibernation to pee or feed if it is mild, but the greater mouse-eared goes deeper into the tunnel and remains motionless for longer. Hutson pointed out the different species, with their distinctive features. The natterer’s bat has long, trumpety ears and a Daz-white belly Daubenton’s bat has big feet, which it uses to grab insects off the surface of ponds. These bats are counted three times each winter for Bat Conservation Trust hibernation surveys.We probably didn’t need to, but we talked in low murmurs. I walked past the bats’ somnolent bodies with the same care I take while tiptoeing into my children’s bedroom when they are sleeping.The first question Hutson asked when he found the mouse-eared bat in 2002 was: where did it go after its winter hibernation? Answer this question, and he might find other members of its tribe. Hutson contacted colleagues in Portugal who better knew its lifestyle and were familiar with its preferred summer habitats. “We organised a big survey, well sort of,” he said. “We met in the pub and looked at prime local habitat. It was a time when they were cutting a lot of hay and these bats often go for freshly cut hay, where they can find more insects.”During summer, the greater mouse-eared bat roosts high in church and castle turrets in northern Europe, and in caves in the south. Hutson looked in old sand and chalk mines, and in disused lime kilns. He asked industrial archeologists and consulted other societies for secretive enthusiasts. “There’s always some nut looking for holes in the ground,” he said. “We combed the region for suitable sites.” The bat group appealed to the media, encouraging people to look for big bats. They collected a hair sample to use DNA to identify its origin, but the lab scientists weren’t able to extract DNA at the time.The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham came to film the hunt. But there was no trace of the bat or any of its kin. The bat did turn up at the Sussex tunnel the next winter, however, and the winter after that. Hutson considered putting a VHS radio tag on the bat, but was worried that the burden of a tag could kill it, and he would be blamed. “What put me off in the end was if it didn’t turn up again that winter, I’d be drummed out of the country,” he said. In 2007, however, the protectors plucked up the courage to carefully take the bat off the tunnel wall during its hibernation and inspect it. Its teeth were a bit worn, but it was in good health – and very alone. During his inspection of its private parts, Hutson found signs that it had never been sexually active.We were now 300 metres inside the tunnel. A natterer’s was stuffed into a crevice no wider than a centimetre. “He’s awake, isn’t he?” said Hutson, swiftly moving his torch away so as not to disturb it. Then he pointed his torch towards a bat that was noticeably larger than the others: solid, and tea-cup sized. “A very rare bat,” he said, “but not rare enough for you.” A Bechstein’s bat.What of the mouse-eared bat? “He has definitely moved,” said Sue Harris, who had noted his position during their previous inspection, in February. We were in the relatively warm middle of the tunnel, where it was 8.2C, but there was no bat. Harris walked ahead. Suddenly, her methodical movements became frantic. “I can hardly contain my excitement,” she called out.High up, where a whole brick had fallen from the curve of the tunnel wall, hung a large, sandy-coloured bat. A silver ring wrapped around its forearm shone in our torchlight. The greater mouse-eared bat. The natterer’s bats we had seen weighed 8g. This one weighed more than 30g, with a broad pink muzzle, a long, pale underside, and dark-brown wings folded up tight by its side like an umbrella.It would be hard to bond with a creature you only ever saw perfectly still, in a deep sleep, face averted from the world. Was Hutson fond of it? “I shall be sorry when it’s not there, assuming I outlive it,” he said. “You never know – it might have another 20 years to go. It might be having an easy time, no stresses. It looks quite tough, sort of robust.” But Harris was worried. “He’s looking damp, especially around the neck area. He didn’t look at all damp in February,” she said. Droplets of water glistened silver on his fur. His ring looked tarnished.The bat’s unknowability was frustrating but, after 16 years, Hutson had become resigned to the unanswered questions about this inidual, and the fate of the species in Britain. Where does this bat go? Perhaps to France? Are there really no others? “After a few years I wondered if we should have done more in terms of finding others,” said Hutson, “but now I’m convinced it is a loner and whatever we had done wouldn’t have made a difference.” Could they reintroduce the species using wild specimens caught in continental Europe? “The first problem is that they would have to go into quarantine for at least six months because of rabies. After being in captivity for six months they wouldn’t be too good at operating in the wild.”We reached the end of the tunnel. There was no exit, just a solid wall of breezeblocks. The bat seemed less a pioneer, the first of its kind, than a survivor, the last of its kind – like the tunnel, a dead-end.If there really is only one greater mouse-eared bat in Britain, with no possibility of reproduction, then it is as good as extinct. Seven other British bat species exist in such low numbers that no reliable population data exists. But technology such as bat detectors, which reveal bats by the sound of their echolocation, is helping better monitor populations. The Bat Conservation Trust’s systematic monitoring of 10 species since the start of this century has revealed an unexpected picture: nine of these appear to be increasing in number. If true, it is yet another way in which bats have surprised us.But counting bats accurately is difficult, said Mathews. They are usually counted where they are known to roost, but scientists have yet to work out a way of counting the number of roosts in an area. “Unless we know that, it makes it very, very difficult to understand what is going on with the population,” she said. Current threats to bats seem to spring from misunderstanding of both human and bat nature. Today, every bat and every roosting site in the EU is protected by the EU Habitats Directive. But legal protection infuriates many home-owners and developers, and may encourage the furtive destruction of bat colonies.Environmental legislation usually follows a “polluter pays” principle, but with bats, the person providing a home for bats is penalised, and must meet all the expense of surveying and providing alternative sites. The government is promising that after Brexit, public money for farmers will be based on the services they provide for the ecosystem (clean water, fertile soils etc). Mathews wondered whether a similar formula could be applied to homeowners who provide bat services.“You can understand why people find it frustrating when they want to convert their barn and it’s got bats in it and it’s a complete palaver,” she said. “Whoever has a bat roost is providing a service to the rest of the community, so there should be a community effort to make sure the bats are protected.”The second challenge for bats is another visible sign of society’s supposed care for them: the bat bridges that  new roads. These trellises of wires hung between telegraph poles either side of the carriageway are designed to funnel bats up and safely over fast-moving traffic so they are not killed by cars and lorries when they follow their traditional foraging routes across new roads. Unfortunately, they don’t work: bats are still killed by moving vehicles. And there is no funding to monitor how bats use these bridges, if at all, or to test whether there may be a design that does work.Despite the roads, the regulations, the wind turbines and the barn conversions, Mathews feels there are grounds for optimism for Britain’s rarest bat. The greater mouse-eared bat may have dipped in and out of extinction in Britain, but after decades of decline in northern Europe, the species is on the rise again in countries such as Austria. She believes it might be possible to find out more about the lonely bat’s mysterious life. “My first question was: why don’t we put a GPS tag on it?” she said. “It’s already 16. It’s now or never. We don’t want to intervene and hasten the demise of this animal – it’s that burden of responsibility – , but on the other hand, it does seem a rather wasted opportunity not to find out anything else about it. If it had been me, I would’ve been blitzing the place looking for evidence of greater mouse-eared bats, and I don’t think anybody has.” A new scientific review of British mammal populations states that it is “plausible” that other iniduals are present, and could be revealed by exhaustive searches of potential summer roosting locations, or sites where they “swarm” in autumn.Mathews will start doing just that this summer, putting out special nets – such as a harp trap, a large frame with strings between it which cause a bat to drop unharmed into a collection chamber below. “The same species on the continent is often found in churches and castles and big buildings. We could start looking at these sorts of places. We could also do DNA analysis of historic droppings. Perhaps it does go to France every summer and comes back?

Javid’s unexpected intervention came on the eve of what is expected to be a stormy select committee meeting in which the Brexit-backing tycoon and his colleague Andy Wigmore are expected to be questioned by MPs over their links to Russian officials and business leaders. Javid was asked in the Commons by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty if he would comment further on reports that Banks had met Russia’s ambassador to the UK three times in 2015 and 2016, and had been asked by him if he was interested in participating in a Siberian gold mining deal. The home secretary said his department was liaising with the Cabinet Office and both were “taking this issue seriously, I know they are looking at intelligence and other information they are receiving alongside my department. The two departments are working closely on this issue. I would assure him we are taking it very seriously indeed.” Doughty, after the debate, described Javid’s answer as revelatory. The Labour MP had asked if Javid could “say a little bit about the allegations that we have heard over the weekend in the Observer, Sunday Times and elsewhere about other Russian attempts to undermine parliamentary democracy and our democracy in this country?” MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport select committee are gearing up to ask Banks and his associate Wigmore about the extent of their dealings with the Russian ambassador, and whether Banks took part in the consolidation of a company called GeoProMining as proposed by ambassador Alexander Yakovenko in a meeting scheduled to last at least three hours. A cache of emails leaked first to the Observer and subsequently to the Sunday Times revealed that Banks had three meetings with the Russian ambassador and met other officials in 2015 and 2016, rather than the single “six hour boozy lunch” he had previously acknowledged. The leak came from research conducted by journalist Isabel Oakeshott who is working on a book about the future of Britain’s armed forces with Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft, and was sent via crowdsourced website Byline Media to the Observer. It is understood that Banks hopes to take a combative approach at the select committee meeting, telling people that he has conducted “opposition research” on some of the MPs involved, highlighting for example the fact that, as declared by the committee’s chair Damian Collins in the register of members’ interests, Collins had accepted two tickets worth £1,060 to watch Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea play Crystal Palace in March.The Brexit campaigner also tried to embark on a public relations offensive ahead of the meeting, although he pulled out at the last minute from a pre-recorded interview on the BBC’s Newsnight.Instead he chose to be interviewed on LBC radio by Nigel Farage, where the former Ukip leader turned radio host did ask Banks about the Siberian gold deal and whether it amounted to an attempt by him to “use the Brexit campaign to further his business interests”. Banks, who denies participating in the proposed deal, said in reply “not really”.A statement released in 2016 – at the time when the mining company deal was completed – said a key investor in GeoProMining is Kirill Androsov, a former deputy chief of staff to Vladimir Putin, via his Altera Fund.Banks and Wigmore also told LBC that they would provide to the select committee details of all the meetings they had with CIA and other US officials in the UK to demonstrate they had been talking to a wide range of interested parties ahead of the Brexit referendum.During the radio interview, Farage asked Banks and Wigmore: “Was there, at any point, Russian – or Russian iniduals, or Russian businesses that gave money to Leave.EU?” In reply, Wigmore said: “No. Not one penny or rouble”, while Banks said: “Where is the evidence that we took Russian money? There’s no evidence.”Labour’s front bench weighed in on the controversy for the first time on Sunday. Tom Watson said: “I thought the idea of Kremlin gold being used to destabilise our democracy became redundant at the end of the cold war. Try as he might, Mr Banks can’t just bluster his way out of these serious allegations. Democratic integrity is too important. If it’s true that his account of events is inaccurate, his links to Russian financiers and mine owners must be subject to detailed scrutiny.” Banks was the key financial backer of Farage’s Brexit strategy, providing at least £9m in loans and other donations to the Leave.EU and Grassroots Out campaigns, the small unofficial campaigns that were closely aligned with Ukip. After the unexpected vote for Brexit, Banks has faced questions about the origin of his money with the Electoral Commission conducting an ongoing investigation into the “true source” of his donations to Leave.EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96a3e005fc901b0d448d3fc1d99ddfcb521eb255/0_11_5244_3146/master/5244.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84db67036d330231244b9a7ae52d748c","title":"brexit weekly briefing crunch time for may as commons vote looms","story":"Rebel Tories may be backing off but PM struggling to unite cabinet over post-Brexit future Welcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing.

Thank you.With this week’s crunch Commons votes on the EU withdrawal bill looming, Theresa May told Tory MPs that 15 Lords amendments, including key changes aimed at giving parliament a meaningful final vote and keeping the UK in the customs union, had to be defeated:We must think about the message parliament will send to the EU. I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain ... But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.The prime minister’s comments came amid warnings from Tory rebels that despite earlier reports they were backing away from voting against May - in part because the resulting humiliation could threaten her leadership and let in Boris Johnson - they were not yet satisfied with some of her changes to the legislation. But if ministers were confident a revolt on the withdrawal bill would be headed off, May is still struggling to unite her warring cabinet over the white paper on the UK’s post-Brexit future. A peace summit has been called at Chequers, her country retreat – but not until after the EU summit later this month.This all follows a long private meeting last week with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who expressed a litany of frustrations but was dissuaded from resigning by a concession to insert a (sort-of) end date in the final text of the government’s proposal on the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.Needless to say, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as good as rejected the plan –, which would leave the whole of the UK in the customs union after transition until the future arrangement has been agreed, almost as soon as it was announced, clarifying later with slides that it would still lead to a hard border. In the , Matthew d’Ancona sees huge implications for UK politics in the sheer scale of the contacts revealed between Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore – the “Bad Boys of Brexit” – and Russian officials:This is a parable of geopolitical imbalance, culture wars and deep political sickness. Under our noses, a well-developed network of far-right and nationalist forces seems to have arisen, apparently digitally mobilised and funded by Russian state actors the law regulating elections, campaigns and referendums is woefully out of date (passed four years before Facebook was launched) Moscow is laughing at the rest of the world as Trump pleads its case at the G7 the far-right swoons over Vladimir Putin and Jeremy Corbyn misses no opportunity to give the Russian president the benefit of the doubt over the use of nerve agents on British soil and the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria by his puppet in Damascus. This week, as the Commons votes on the very future of this country, don’t forget how we got here how badly we underestimated the populist right and how the leader of the opposition tends to make things easier for Putin, too. Still laughing?In the Observer, Will Hutton argues that as their cause crumbles, Brexiters are turning to fantasy and bitter recriminations – and it’s time for Labour to step up:As a policy, Brexit is beginning to look like the poll tax: attractive as a rightwing pet project but disastrous in practice. Then, the Tory party still had enough political nous to rescue itself, even at the cost of losing its prime minister. Now, as Boris Johnson acknowledges and David Davis’s threatened resignation symbolised, it is at war with itself and the realists are trying to rescue a third-best solution against those in Brexit La-La land. Theresa May’s impossible mission is to reconcile Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage’s red lines on sovereignty, freedom of movement and leaving every EU institution and trade policy, with an economy that requires the opposite. It would be hard enough with a united cabinet and years of negotiating time within the two years allowed by the article 50 process and Brexit millenarian narcissists it cannot be done. Occasionally in politics there is the opportunity to do the right thing and secure massive party advantage. If Jeremy Corbyn were to declare that the Labour party wanted to stay in the EU – crucially, only politically sellable with new and aggressive initiatives to identify, control and manage the numbers of immigrants – he would transform his and his party’s standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d9bd22c2cd925f32444d43fd49e92468d6fec25/0_35_5843_3506/master/5843.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a56dec70f28ddf6cae31d0adca8d81","title":"boys do more exercise than girls research finds","story":"Girls and young women, especially those from lower income backgrounds and ethnic minorities, do far less physical activity than is recommendedAdolescent girls and young women are less likely to engage in heart-rate raising recreational activities than their male peers, and when they do keep at it for shorter periods of time, research has revealed.Current guidelines in the UK and US recommend that children and teens undertake at least an hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity a day, with adults advised to aim for 150 minutes a week. Dr Charlene Wong, co-author of the research from Duke University in North Carolina, said the research could help to direct public health interventions, noting that the study suggests the focus should be on females, young adults and those from minority and low-income backgrounds.“Our black female young adults were the least likely to say they did any physical activity and those who did were active for the shortest amount of time,” she said. Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Wong and colleagues describe how they pooled and analysed data from an annual nationwide health survey in the US, encompassing the years 2007 to 2016, focusing on responses from 9,472 iniduals aged between 12 and 29.The survey, carried out through interviews, asked participants questions about their levels of physical activity relating to sports or recreational pursuits.For those who did get their blood pumping, the amount of time spent exercising also fell with age, from just over 71 minutes a day for adolescent boys to just over 50 minutes for those aged 25 to 29. For girls, it fell from 56 minutes to just over 39 minutes a day respectively.White adolescent boys were the most likely to say they exercised in a week, with black males aged 18-24 reporting the longest duration of physical activity a day.Once factors including weight, education and income were taken into account, the team found race was linked to whether females reported any physical activity: in general, a larger proportion of white females said they exercised than black or Hiic participants. The trend was less clear for males.Higher income was linked to reporting physical activity for females regardless of age, but the same only held true for adolescent boys and not young men, while young adults with a college education were more likely to report any exercise across both sexes. Weight had little impact on whether participants reported exercising.While it is not clear what is behind the trends, the authors say multiple factors might be at play including issues around body image, social norms for exercise being different between the sexes, less scheduled activity after leaving school and growing pressures of working life.But the study had limitations, including that activity such as walking to work was not included, it was not considered whether participants had children, or were pregnant, and the authors admit that self-reported data can lead to an over-estimation of activity. Dr Gavin Sandercock, an expert in child activity and fitness from the University of Essex who was not involved in the study, said the findings mirror certain trends seen in the UK, including that females exercise less than males and that physical activity drops across both sexes with age.While he noted there are already some campaigns aimed at encouraging girls and women to exercise, including This Girl Can, he said it was also important to help iniduals of both sexes from lower income groups to become physically active. “We know that if you get children more active, as well as getting more physically healthy, they get happier and their educational attainment improves,” he said.Joan Duda, professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham, said offering a choice of activities and cultivating a sense of empowerment is key: “We need to do more to promote participation in physical activity in the case of adolescent females, and males, not just taking it up or giving a particular activity ‘a go’ but also how to sustain quality engagement,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804b33e0d20e2587f1bd0556eb33890c045f5258/0_172_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5340a1bb4be4ee954f8f1be8cd937abb","title":"chris froome lizzie deignan doping cases reputations","story":"• ‘Unfortunately for Chris his reputation is tarnished’• Deignan: UK Anti-Doping should have protected my reputationLizzie Deignan has claimed Chris Froome has been denied a fair process in his anti-doping case and criticised the testing authorities for not doing more to protect her reputation after three whereabouts failings.Deignan, known as Armitstead until she married Team Sky rider Philip Deignan in 2016, said Froome’s name had been unfairly tarnished.  and the French newspaper Le Monde made public the fact Froome had returned an adverse finding to a urine test submitted during his Vuelta a España victory last September.Froome is fighting the finding and has continued to compete, winning the Giro d’Italia and stating his intention to compete in the Tour de France next month. Other riders, both active and retired, have said he should remain on the sidelines until the case is resolved.“He hasn’t had a fair process because already people have made up their minds unfortunately, and that is not based on the full story,” Deignan said. “Unfortunately for Chris his reputation is tarnished and will be for ever. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s kind of irrelevant to some people at this stage. A leak in a legal process should never happen.”Froome’s failed test indicated twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol in his system. The 33‑year‑old insisted he had not taken more than the allowed amount of the drug, which is a specified substance.“A rider should be protected because inevitably there will be things that happen, grey areas that should be looked at logically, scientifically, and analysed in court,” Deignan told the When Orla Met podcast. “That’s an inevitable part of having asthma and taking an inhaler and I think unfortunately he hasn’t had a fair process. It’s a very personal story.”Deignan escaped a ban in 2016 after three whereabouts failings in a 12-month period. The court of arbitration for sport accepted that in the first occurrence a doping control officer had not tried hard enough to locate the Olympic silver medallist when she was at a hotel for a training camp in Sweden.However, Deignan is still disappointed in the UK Anti-Doping Agency. “I felt really let down by UK Anti-Doping at the time that they didn’t publicly defend the fact I was tested within a day of both missed tests and obviously all my samples have proved negative. I’ve never doped.“All I needed was for them to say ‘We made a mistake, we’re an organisation that’s totally funded to do this job and we’ve made a mistake.’ They haven’t taken ownership or apologised or anything. You’re still working with a system that is not even good. I think there’s still a long way to go for them to be transparent themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adcf4c3a95a06d44139bb327ca6b8a5fc03d2e5a/0_271_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64a4a175f402ea61a889d8a91e55725f","title":"daniel bell drummond england class divide low income areas cricket","story":"Daniel Bell-Drummond talks of his ambition to climb into the Test top order as well as to develop cricket in low-income areasDaniel Bell-Drummond does not get recognised much as he walks around his home streets in Catford, south-east London. In fact he does not get recognised – as the Americans say – period.“No. Never. Only by my family, they recognise me,” he says, happy to lounge behind his cloak of invisibility in the gloomy depths of Rushey Green Costa Coffee.A little later Bell-Drummond of Kent and England Lions will wander home along the thronging boulevards as teenagers in shorts and trainers drift past without a flicker of interest in the professional sportsman in their midst, not far from the spot where Liverpool’s Joe Gomez, another son of the Catford soil, was engulfed by a selfie-popping mob last year.Bell-Drummond is 24, an England regular through the age groups, and routinely lumped in among the most exciting young cricketers in the country. There is no doubt about his basic talent, as witnessed by a thrillingly poised 92-ball hundred against an Australia attack led by Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson at Canterbury three summers ago.After a slow-burn couple of years in red-ball cricket he is on the edge of being on the edge of things with England, the next-best, almost‑but‑not-quite attacking right-handed opener in an era of a great many England openers.For now Bell-Drummond’s anonymity in the area where he was born and grew up is significant in other ways. The dying back of the national summer sport to privileged minority pastime, something that takes place in the green spaces on the edge of town, is one of the hot topics in the game.When it comes to urban areas such as Lewisham, with its population the size of Iceland, its low-income demographic, its lack of easy green space, cricket is an almost total absence. Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Alastair Cook could form a human pyramid and stroll through the shopping centre eating Polish deli sausage and skanking to reggae music from the CD stall next to Tesco and still fail to draw much of a crowd. Everyone agrees. Something needs to be done. But what?As an inner-city kid, and as one of only seven black or mixed race English cricketers now active across the 18 counties, Bell‑Drummond knows more about this than most. And it is here he starts to present another kind of story, and another kind of opportunity too.The Platform initiative, launched this summer, is based on an original idea by Bell-Drummond. The intention is to bring cricket back into schools from which it has retreated, and in particular to re‑sew a passion for the sport among kids of Caribbean descent.An after-school coaching programme began in the spring, driven on by the tireless work of cricketing outreach figures such as Chris Willetts, known locally for the 10-year project of ferrying kids in a minibus from Tower Hamlets through the Blackwall Tunnel to play at Blackheath, their only realistic chance of regular cricket.Last week a selection of south London primary schools, from Ashmead in Brockley to Edmund Waller in New Cross, competed at a first inter-school festival day in Deptford Park, under the avuncular eyes of Bell-Drummond and Tymal Mills.There is on the face of it nothing but good to come of this, although the initiative is yet to attract any support from the England and Wales Cricket Board, who you might have thought would leap at the chance. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of Platform is the presence of current players in its midst. Does Bell-Drummond feel extra pressure in the professional side of his life given his own status as outlier, role model, and all-round bellwether of changing times?This narrowing has been a regular note of lament. England’s 1992 World Cup final team had two black players from the same London comprehensive, a state of affairs that is slightly mind-boggling now. Fast forward and there are only three black British cricketers under the age of 25 – Abi Sakande at Sussex, Liam Hurt at Lancashire and Bell‑Drummond – playing among the counties.Bell-Drummond and Willetts are quick to stress there is no suggestion professional cricket has an obvious race problem. It is more that these are class issues to do with the sport’s own walling up within the private school system and behind the velvet rope of pay-TV.“I haven’t experienced direct racism or had any bad treatment because of where I’m from or being black,” Bell-Drummond says of his playing days at Kent and beyond. “But I do think a lot of that is to do with the schools I went to. Going to Dulwich Prep and Millfield has played a massive part for me. Those are big advantages. It’s definitely more a class thing.”Barriers come in more diffuse ways, obstacles Bell-Drummond himself was able to hurdle thanks to the efforts of his energetically hands-on Jamaican-born father.“I was privileged growing up. There were a lot of kids who loved the game like me, had the same natural ability, but because of the schools I went to, because of my parents being able to drive me everywhere I had a massive natural advantage. Something I didn’t agree with is that a lot of those guys just didn’t have that chance.”“We just want to see more ersity right down to club cricket, with more people from all backgrounds, not just Caribbean, coming in to clubs. You might not find the next Alastair Cook but ultimately we just want to get those people playing cricket and feeling they belong in it.”This is a process Bell-Drummond has had to work through himself, from making hundreds aged seven in Kent junior cricket, to gaining scholarships to some of the nation’s most gloriously manicured boarding schools. An adolescence in the London Schools Cricket Association ranks helped speed his development. Millfield school provided a favourite junior coach and all-round early mentor in the shape of Mark Davies, a veteran of the Garner-Richards-Botham years at Somerset. Bell-Drummond ended up being named Wisden schools cricketer of the year.A similar sustained glut of runs is required now to nudge his way up the list of hopefuls as Alastair Cook’s next piece of disposable arm-candy at the top of England’s Test order.Test cricket, not the white‑ball stuff, remains the dream, an obsession formed during the early years spent marvelling at Brian Lara and Marcus Trescothick, childhood top‑order heroes.“I’ve had my go with the Lions and done fairly well, mainly in white-ball cricket, but ultimately I think I’m more suited to red-ball cricket. I’ve been working on a few things and hopefully now I can get in the runs at the right time.”Beyond this Bell-Drummond is that rare thing: an athlete with a nerd-level love of his sport, able to speak with real enthusiasm about the Nepalese Sandeep Lamichhane’s signing by the Delhi Daredevils, to offering informed early scepticisms about the concept of The Hundred, and a phlegmatic view on the slightly scary Twitter clips doing the rounds of Morne Morkel in action for the Surrey seconds, a bowler against whom Bell-Drummond would open next day in the Royal London Cup at Beckenham (he made 48 Kent won).Best young English batsman around? Olly Pope. Best English spinner? Jack Leach. Quickest bowler in county cricket? Jofra Archer and Tymal Mills. “I can’t split the two. But Archer is more freaky, you don’t know where it’s coming from. He just jogs in with a really chilled action and suddenly the ball hits you.”Platform is due to roll on for another year in south-east London. Before then Bell-Drummond will continue to press for his own case for the opportunity to become just the second black Briton to make a Test debut this century. Whether he makes it or not you get the feeling top‑order runs might not be the last of his gifts to the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc66328bd36c9d8b145a893963b186e8f422d11e/0_202_4067_2440/master/4067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f43c101cc573441c0d99c1fc206073e","title":"monogamy review celebrity chef cooks up an apocalyptic stew","story":"Park theatre, LondonTorben Betts’s social satire about a beleaguered kitchen goddess builds to a bewildering climax of panic and violenceTorben Betts clearly sees cooking as a source of drama. In Muswell Hill (2012) he showed a disastrous dinner party from the perspective of the kitchen. His new play deals with the disintegration of a popular female TV chef but, while Betts is good on the gulf between public and private faces, a play that starts as social satire ends up improbably apocalyptic. We first see Betts’s heroine, Caroline, rehearsing her TV show in her kitchen, but troubles, as Hamlet says, come not single spies but in battalions. Just for starters, Caroline has to deal with tabloid photos exposing her dead drunk, the long-delayed coming out of her socialist son and the revelation of her affair with a married builder. Betts shrewdly reminds us that fame offers no insulation against misfortune, but, as Caroline’s life falls apart, so too does the play as it leads to a bewildering climax full of panic and violence. Having started with a specific target, Betts ends up tackling the explosion of the nuclear family and the decline and fall of the middle classes. Alastair Whatley’s production is, however, strongly cast. As Caroline, Janie Dee easily convinces us she could be “the country’s second favourite kitchen goddess” while conveying the desperation of a devout believer appalled at her failure to live up to her principles. Genevieve Gaunt is very funny as her language-distorting PA and there is strong support from Patrick Ryecart as Caroline’s apoplectic husband and Jack Sandle as her invaluable handyman. The problem is that Betts seems torn between writing a comedy about celebrity chefs and demonstrating that the family is an outdated cultural construct. • Monogamy is at Park theatre, London, until 7 July.

This means they are able to keep the car on the road using existing combinations of technologies such as range-guided cruise control and lane-keeping aids. They are not able to deal with the task of driving under all scenarios, meaning that the driver has to pay attention to the road at all times and may have to suddenly take over. A recent spate of accidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot system has highlighted the need for drivers to be much more aware of the limitations of driving aids.In a fatal collision in Silicon Valley in March, a Tesla Model X with Autopilot activated sped up and steered into a concrete barrier at 70.8mph. Another Tesla crashed into a stationary police car in Laguna Beach, while a Model S crashed into the back of a stopped firetruck in Utah. Drivers should have taken over control to avoid these incidents.Drivers have also been found blatantly flouting safety laws, including one man who was banned from driving for 18 months after being filmed sitting in the passenger seat of a Model S in Autopilot mode on the M1.A Tesla spokesperson said: “The feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what Autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of. “When using Autopilot, drivers are continuously reminded of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of the vehicle at all times. This is designed to prevent driver misuse, and is among the strongest driver-misuse safeguards of any kind on the road today.”While Tesla is the carmaker that’s most aggressive in pushing its driving aids as autonomous systems, similar options are available on cars starting from around £25,000, including the new Nissan Leaf. Renault is also installing the technologies into its next-generation Clio, expected in 2020.“Don’t think it’s just £90,000 Teslas or Mercedes that have got this, it’s going right down the line as manufactures use systems required by Euro NCAP safety regulations to sell features consumers are now demanding,” said Avery.While progress is being made by carmakers towards level 5 fully autonomous vehicles capable of handling all scenarios, their public availability is still many years away.For now, drivers are being sold increasingly sophisticated driving aids that are technically and legally incapable of fully autonomous driving. Despite how the aids are marketed, drivers are criminally liable for the safe operation of their cars.“The capability of current road vehicle technologies must not be oversold,” said Avery. “Names like Autopilot or ProPilot are deeply unhelpful, as they infer the car can do a lot more than it can. Absolute clarity is needed to help drivers understand the when and how these technologies are designed to work and that they should always remain engaged in the driving task.”Ivan Drury, a senior manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, who was not involved in the report, said that carmakers need to balance the idea that they are pushing the envelope with the drawback of overselling the competencies their systems actually have.“Features such as ABS brakes, cruise control and blindspot detectors are driver aids that are relatively standard across the board from one carmaker to the next however, the varying degrees of ‘autonomy’ that are currently rolling out in the market vary drastically when it comes to the level of engagement required from the driver, what obstacles the system can avoid, how the vehicle corrects itself and more. “Education is critical not only to ensure the safety of consumers, but to pave the way forward for the adoption of these technologies.”Thatcham Research has set out 10 key recommendations for assisted driving technologies, including clear naming, driver engagement monitoring and crash intervention. It is testing a series of systems on cars and will grade them in a report for use by insurers in the autumn.A Tesla spokesperson said: “Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn’t make the car impervious to all accidents and the issues described by Thatcham won’t be a problem for drivers using Autopilot correctly.”A Nissan spokesperson said: “ProPilot Assist is a hands-on, eyes-on, driver-assist system that can be used for motorway and dual carriageway driving. This is clearly communicated to customers at all stages of the purchase process. The system requires the driver to be in control at all times, and with their hands on the steering wheel – the system deactivates if this is not the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ab6e137aec22f53629acdd96e8e40fa0c9363a1/0_304_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb534450c802887180edbfdd6103bd3e","title":"10 best surf schools in world portugal hawaii south africa norway","story":"What sets these surf schools apart is a commitment to excellence when it comes to tuition, which will help you to catch a wave from Portugal to Hawaii, South Africa to Norway Surf camps provide a taste of the surfing lifestyle and include accommodation and transport, as well as social activities where you can meet other surfers.

The letter came in August, 1975, inviting her to go and view flat number 13. “I thought it was\u0026nbspa palace compared to where I was coming from,” she recalls in the opening frames of Grenfell (BBC One), Ben Anthony’s profoundly moving feature-length documentary. Later, in the disorientating days after the fire that ripped through the tower in minutes, claiming the lives of 72 people, we meet Lorraine again. “My whole life was in that flat,” she says,\u0026nbspher face crumpling. “It’s a horror story. Everything’s gone.”Shahin Sadafi, fifth floor, said that Grenfell was “our base, fortress, a concrete castle”. “I was very proud to live there,” says Edward Daffarn, 16th floor, his mouth contorting with grief. “Stay put,” Nick Burton, 19th floor, recalls being told, like others higher up the tower. “It’s concrete. It’s not going anywhere.” He escaped with his\u0026nbspwife, Maria del Pilar Burton, but she\u0026nbspnever recovered,\u0026nbspand died seven months later. “When it comes\u0026nbspit hits you\u0026nbspreally hard,” says Nabil Choucair of\u0026nbspfinding out, after an agonising wait of weeks, that his\u0026nbspmother, sister,\u0026nbspbrother-in-law and their\u0026nbspthree daughters, who lived on the 22nd floor, all died. “Every\u0026nbsptime they told us\u0026nbspabout one it was like a knife going through you.”The articulacy, measure and resolve maintained by survivors is a deeply humbling aspect of this respectful documentary, which began filming the day after the fire\u0026nbspand continued throughout the year. What hits you most is the grief, still so fresh, still so engulfing. Everyone breaks down and cries, from Yasmeen, Choucair’s 11-year-old daughter, showing drawings she has done of the tower in flames, to Zeyad Cred, who organises monthly silent walks around the tower, remembering how the first one, “in the midst of all that\u0026nbspdespair … neutralised everyone”.Grenfell, stitched together from hundreds of hours of interviews and filming, as well as archive and social\u0026nbspmedia footage, airs at a highly sensitive time, amid\u0026nbspthe public inquiry and approaching the first anniversary. Everyone is talking about Grenfell again: the response from the council and central government, allegations of institutional racism, the cladding and the fire brigade’s stay put policy. And everyone has their take\u0026nbspon who was most at fault, though\u0026nbspno perspective can\u0026nbspbe truly objective or orced\u0026nbspfrom personal bias. What is so vital about Anthony’s take\u0026nbspis its resolute focus\u0026nbspon the erse working-class\u0026nbsppeople to whom\u0026nbspthis tragedy continues to happen. The voices that\u0026nbsproutinely get drowned out, ignored and\u0026nbspdisrespected, which many say is why the fire\u0026nbspstarted\u0026nbspin the first place.Residents recall lifts regularly out of order, rotting kitchens, and surges of power that made toasters smoke and sparks come out of light fittings in the months leading up to the fire. What emerges is a community deeply wounded by the fire and its aftermath, but also by the cumulative\u0026nbspdespair of being overlooked for so long. If there is a\u0026nbspprevailing message here it is about\u0026nbspthe contempt with which successive governments treat people\u0026nbspin social housing.Local people from mosques and synagogues, churches and rugby clubs recall stepping up in the aftermath. All report the absence of\u0026nbspauthorities. Some volunteers were\u0026nbspthemselves survivors. Hassan Awadh Hassan, 23rd\u0026nbspfloor, was away from his wife and two daughters visiting his sick brother\u0026nbspin Egypt on the night of the fire. “I see the news.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbsptake my passport and go to the airport straight away,” he says. “I go to duty-free to buy\u0026nbspchocolate for my two daughters.” He breaks down in\u0026nbsptears. All\u0026nbspthree\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthem died.Lorraine returns to the burnt-out tower one last time and regrets it. “It looked like something out of world war two,” she says. “I’ll never forget it. I wish I hadn’t done it. I had a lot of memories there …” She breaks down. The\u0026nbspwords fail.

At a ceremony in Dublin, where he received an award for making an outstanding contribution to Europe, Kenny also lamented British business’s silence on the matter.His words will come as a sharp rebuke to Brexiters including members of the DUP who have said that if Kenny were still in power there would not be the problems with the Irish border. In March, Jacob Rees-Mogg said “mature” and “responsible” Kenny’s “common sense approach” had been replaced by a “irresponsible vote-catching” Varadkar. His remarks came as Varadkar suggested there could be an extension to article 50 if it looked as if there was no deal in sight. “You’ll know that there are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a ‘no-deal’ situation. For example, it is possible to extend article 50 to allow more time for negotiations to take place. There is the possibility of an interim deal, or a transition period, pending an outcome or final negotiations over the transition period,” he told TV3. The Irish prime minister said suggestions that the talks go to the wire with a deal sealed in the small hours of the morning were wide of the mark.“I’ve heard some people talking about the possibility of a crunch late-night meeting in Brussels in late October, something akin to a last-minute budget compromise or a fisheries council,” Varadkar added. He said Kenny’s suggestion that there could be an extra summit, perhaps in September, October or even November, to help seal a deal was “helpful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dae9744f55355d7e1a38d3a3cdb7bd3dabf5fc/0_352_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70766677297866d1bf34e7debb409223","title":"israel to top up sea of galiliee after years of drought","story":"Inland lake where Christians believe Jesus walked on water has reached its lowest level in a century The shrinking Sea of Galilee, the inland lake where Christians believe Jesus walked on water, is to be topped up with desalinated seawater.A plan given Israeli cabinet approval will pump 100 million cubic metres of water annually by 2022 into the lake in the Galilee region, said Yechezkel Lifshitz, from the country’s energy and water ministry.In 2017 Israel’s water authority said the sea, hit by years of drought, had reached its lowest level in a century.Situated 200 metres (656ft) below sea level and 28 miles (45km) from the coast, the Sea of Galilee is mentioned in the bible as the site of a number of Jesus’s miracles.Known in Hebrew as Lake Kinneret, it covers an area of roughly 62 square miles (160 sq km). Ten years ago it provided 400m cubic metres a year of fresh water and was the country’s largest freshwater reserve.But a series of dry winters have reduced its level to such an extent that pumping had to be limited to 30-40m cubic metres a year.He said two more plants would be built to serve the new project: one in the Galilee and another south of Jerusalem. The water would then be pumped into the lake’s tributaries in northern Israel.“We are turning the Kinneret into a reservoir for desalinated water,” said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. “This is innovative and important, at least to the extent we are doing this, and has not been done until now.”Lifshitz said that the long-term goal was to pump 1.1bn cubic metres per year by 2030, rising to 1.2bn when needed – at a “relatively high cost”, equivalent to more than $0.70 cents per cubic metre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92884e2b823c70e9fe16bef906b006a257cc33e9/128_343_4230_2539/master/4230.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26e57dbd613c0d370909b5cd5a29a9d4","title":"singapore meeting what we know so far","story":"Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un signed a commitment to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.

Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, several Taiwanese government officials as well as legislators were also present. During the ceremony, US ambassador James Moriarty and Royce reiterated Washington’s commitment to uphold the relationship with Taiwan, calling the new facility “a symbol of strength and vibrancy of the US and Taiwan partnership in the 21st century”.“AIT’s new home is a tangible symbol that reflects the strength of our ties,” said Royce. “It’s a state-of-the-art facility that will make possible even greater cooperation for many years to come.”The ceremony comes at a time when bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington have been severely tested over the ongoing trade negotiation and rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea.China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan since the election in 2016,blocking the self-ruled island from participating in international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and poaching its diplomatic allies. Beijing has also increased the frequency of military exercises in the last few months, including deploying its own aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday night, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times published an editorial, suggesting Beijing should warn the US and Taiwan of possible consequences for any provocative move. “We must draw a red line for the US and Taiwan,” Global Times said through the editorial. “Once crossed, a serious Taiwan Straits crisis will be triggered.”Despite media speculation that Trump would send the new national security advisor John Bolton to the ceremony, the US president exercised restrain. Kharis Templeman, a social science research associate at Stanford University’s Walter H. Shorenstein Asia Pacific research center, said that given the delicate nature of the summit in Singapore, the Trump administration may have chosen not to use the occasion to make a strong symbolic statement.However, Templeman suggested the ceremony should not be interpreted as revealing the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy in general. “High-level visits can be arranged at any time, not just when AIT inaugurates a new building,” Templeman told the . “Any US administration would have made a similar set of statements at the official opening.”The American Institute in Taiwan is not an official embassy, but a non-profit institution established by the US government to represent its interest since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 under the One China policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06771431813a6b6dc7ed2e725b18cf39ea3a9fc9/0_31_3128_1876/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d30841f77221fa3fb22d661d9627458b","title":"g7 summit a weekend of international diplomacy in pictures","story":"The summit took place in La Malbaie, in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Canada, at the weekend, where leaders struggled to heal a tariff dispute that has pushed them to the brink of a trade war.

File photograph: Caroline QuinnPA Wire A number of changes along 16 Dublin bus routes are proposed as part of the €2 billion Bus Connects project which will be published today.The National Transport Authority says it will offer a number of measures, from paying for the landscaping of new gardens to trying to find alternative car parking, for residents along the route of a massive bus upgrade project.The following is a list of the challenges and proposed changes along the 16 bus routes. Due to restricted road width on the Malahide Road between Fairview and Griffith Avenue, a proposal is to reroute cyclists via Brian Road and Charleton Road. Swords Road in Santry from Shanrath Road to the Omni centre: if bus lanes were provided in each direction, this street would then only be able to accommodate one general traffic lane. This would make the street one-way for general traffic, with inbound traffic routed via Coolock lane and Santry bypass. A new slip road would be incorporated to link the southbound Santry bypass to Shantalla Road. Restricted road width on Hart’s Corner and turning system make it difficult to provide continuous bus and cycle lanes. Botanic Road, Glasnevin Hill and Ballymun Road: to allow a bus lane in each direction on St Mobhi Road while maintaining existing trees along this street, outbound general traffic could be routed via Botanic Road, Glasnevin Road and Ballymun Road. St Mobhi Road would become one-way southbound for general traffic while allowing residents to also access the road in the northbound direction by using the bus lane. Old Cabra Road and Prussia Street: In order to provide bus lanes, a proposal is to remove general through-traffic on these two streets. Local access would still be maintained, including to the shopping centre. M50 junction: The provision of continuous bus lanes through the junction may impact on the overall traffic capacity of this junction. Because of constrained width through Mount Brown and Old Kilmainham Road, both bus lanes and traffic lanes cannot be accommodated. To deliver bus priority along this route it would be necessary to restrict Mount Brown to public transport, cyclists and local access only. Through-traffic would have to be erted via the Quays or South Circular Road. Because of restricted width on Ballyfermot Road between Le Fanu Road and Kylemore Road, one option would be to ert inbound traffic via Le Fanu Road and Kylemore Road. Road width restrictions at the M50 underpass. A proposal is that cyclists will use the canal greenway at this point. There is a proposal to construct new link roads to ert all traffic via Calmount Avenue and Calmount Road while still maintaining access to the old section of Greenhills Road. A proposal to restrict a section of Kimmage Road Lower between Sundrive Road and Harold’s Cross to bus, cycle and taxi only. Through-traffic would then be erted via Larkfield Park and Harold’s Cross Road or via Sundrive Road and Clogher Road. Templeogue Road is constrained in Terenure. There is a proposal to make Templeogue Road one-way outbound for general traffic while permitting taxis, buses and bicycles to travel in both directions. Inbound general traffic would be asked to ert via Cypress Grove Road or via Springfield Road to Rathfarnham Road. Rathmines road: To provide one bus lane and one traffic lane in each direction would require narrowing the route’s footpaths. An alternative option is to ert outbound traffic via Ranelagh and make Rathmines Road one-way for general traffic, in addition to providing two bus lanes. Shankill village is constrained in terms of available road space, making bus and cycle provision very challenging. There is a proposal to ert cyclists around Shankill village via a series of quiet routes and new cycling lanes to the east of the village. A number of significant traffic junction reconfigurations would be required together with some traffic movement restrictions at the locations. Challenges include proximity to Booterstown marsh, an environmentally designated are,a and layout at Merrion Gates junction. Will require the introduction of a contraflow bus lane on City Quay. Restricted width at the Scherzer lifting bridges, which are protected structures. A new bridge is required over the River Dodder at the east end of Sir John Rogerson’s Quay. The report also says an overhaul of the system will see the development of a new ticketing system, using credit cards and mobile phones to make payment more convenient. It states the implementation of a cashless payment system will also speed up passenger boarding times.

Photograph: Alan BetsonMore than 1,000 homes in Dublin will lose gardens and parking places under plans by the National Transport Authority to create 16 high-speed bus routes in the city.Under the changes, to be announced today by the authority, 230km of expanded bus lanes and 200km of cycle lanes are to be constructed within a decade.However, the authority warns that because there is “so little unused space” along some roads, that “it will often not be possible to accommodate the bus lanes and cycle lanes in the width available”.The 16 routes are : Clongriffin to city centre Swords to city centre Ballymun to city centre Finglas to Phibsborough Blanchardstown to city centre Lucan to city centre Liffey Valley to city centre Clondalkin to Drimnagh Greenhills to city centre Kimmage to city centre Tallaght to Terenure Rathfarnham to city centre Bray to city centre UCD Ballsbridge to city centre Blackrock to Merrion and Ringsend to city centre.On each of these routes, there will only be one lane for private traffic in and out of the city centre. The “Bus Connects” plan will cost €2 billion and will be completed by 2027.Sections of gardens will be bought by compulsory purchase. The NTA said it will pay for landscaping for the remainder and try to find alternative car parking for affected residents .Some footpaths will be narrowed, while a significant number of trees will also have to be removed where they are in the way of the new bus routes, the reports make clear.Unveiling the €2 billion plan today, the Authority will argue that “tough choices” are needed if the city’s bus network – which carries over two-thirds of all public transport users in the Greater Dublin Area – is to be improved.“There are no longer any simple changes which we can make that would generate meaningful benefits,” the blueprint for the “core bus corridors” project warns. “These are tough changes which cannot, and will not be made lightly.”Sources told The  it is expected that compensation worth “tens of thousands of euro” will be paid for each of an estimated 1,300 front gardens or commercial premises that would be affected.Fine Gael Dublin North-West TD Noel Rock criticised the NTA’s action, saying tens of thousands of home-owners will now fear that they will be affected, not just the 1,300 proposed.“Progress always has a price, but decent communication, transparency and fair treatment of those affected should be essential,” said Mr Rock. Some houses could end up just yards from the road-edge, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527094.1528746753!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"enda kenny says uk government lacks credibility on brexit","story":"Politics in Britain lacks credibility according to former taoiseach Enda Kenny who was in Dublin to receive Ireland’s European of the Year award for 2018.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer taoiseach Enda Kenny receives the European Movement Ireland’s European of the Year  award. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe British government is “riven by internal dissent” and lacks credibility on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, former taoiseach Enda Kenny has said.Mr Kenny, in his first major public intervention since standing down as taoiseach a year ago, said he was “appalled” at what was happening in British politics.Mr Kenny’s remarks undermine criticism of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar by pro-Brexit British Conservatives who have claimed that Brexit negotiations would be more productive if a more experienced politician like the former taoiseach was involved.His views emerged as Mr Varadkar raised the possibility of postponing the formal date of Brexit in March 2019 if the EU and UK are unable to agree a deal before then.“There are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a ‘no deal’ situation,” Mr Varadkar told TV3.Speaking at an event in Dublin, Mr Kenny said there had been little progress since last December, when the UK and EU initially agreed to a number of issues, such as the so-called “backstop”, he added.“The EU continues to negotiate from a unified position. British business is afraid to speak out because of the spectre of a Labour government.”He added: “If this matter is not dealt with, and if negotiations have not been concluded and signed off before the EU council in October, then we might have a very different outcome.”Mr Kenny was speaking at a lunch hosted by the European Movement Ireland, which named him European of the Year. He was presented with the award by Mr Varadkar, who paid warm tribute to his predecessor.Mr Kenny called on European Council president Donald Tusk to convene a special summit later this year to sign off on the final Brexit withdrawal treaty.The Government has conceded that a deal on the so-called “backstop” - which guarantees no hard Border between North and South, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario - will not be completed until the withdrawal agreement is finalised in October.Mr Kenny said the October summit would not be a negotiating meeting, adding that Britain was not represented at the European Council when Brexit was discussed.“So if the negotiations have not been concluded before that meeting, then the European Council of 27 will meet to discuss among themselves, without Britain, and it will not be in a position to make a difference,” he said.“This is so serious, I believe, that the president of the council, should consider either having a meeting before that meeting in October or afterwards, specifically and solely to deal with signing off and hopefully concluding negotiations on the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. I say that in the context of maintaining relationships that we have with our friends across the water.”Mr Kenny also criticised the US administration led by President Trump, among other international governments, for populism and “aggressive nationalism”.“But there are still enough who know and celebrate the difference between patriotism and nationalism. How patriotism burns quietly, furiously in the human heart, how aggressive nationalism sets fire to decency, responsibility, memory, even humanity itself.”He also spoke of the a “quantum change in geo-politics and economics” with an “emerging Russia and China” and “an America that is frequently unrecognisable”.On the North, Mr Kenny said the EU’s declaration that Northern Ireland would be automatically readmitted to the union in the event of Irish unity proved again that the “ballot overruled” the bullet.Mr Kenny secured such an agreement from the EU last year, and it had become known as the “Kenny text”.It says: “The European Council acknowledges that the Good Friday Agreement expressly provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about through peaceful and democratic means.“In this regard, the European Council acknowledges that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.”Speaking on Monday, Mr Kenny said it would provide an opportunity for Northern Ireland in the future.“That opportunity, while it is not for now, is there for all to judge at some future time. It puts paid, for once and for all, to the warped mentality held by the Provisional IRA that it was possible to bomb the six counties into a united Ireland. The ballot overrules the bullet here.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526584.1528718548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the exceptional weather is coming to an end met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            People play a game of cards at the beach on Bull Island on a sunny day near Dublin this weekend.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt has been as glorious a start to the summer as most of us can remember and the good weather is set to continue for the next few days at least.However, Met Éireann is warning the “exceptional weather” will come to an end later this week.Dublin recorded one of its sunniest weeks on record last week with some 80 hours of sunshine, the equivalent of more than 11 hours a day.Monday will be mild and dry in most places with a respectable 21 degrees in the midlands and east. This is cooler than of late and the sunshine will be more hazy, but still above normal for the time of year.Tuesday will be a similar kind of day and both days will be dry across the country.A notable change is due on Wednesday. The bad news is that rain is forecast across the country for the first time in weeks: the good news is that this will be most welcome by farmers and Irish Water.The rain will appear off the west coast on Wednesday afternoon and gradually extend across the country reaching eastern areas by nighttime.Near drought-like conditions have been experienced across the country for the past three weeks. Dublin has had just 1mm of rain since June 1st and May was exceptionally dry with just a third of the average rainfall recorded for the month.Most places had just trace amounts of rainfall in recent weeks. Even those places that had more normal levels of rainfall in the north and midlands only did so because of heavy thunderstorms last week.There has been several gorse fires over the last few weeks in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and the dry conditions have caused water shortages in the Skerries area of Dublin.The Department of Agriculture has issued an orange “high risk” forest fire warning that remains in place until Wednesday, June 13th.They have asked public if they see a fire to not delay in reporting a fire to the fire and emergency services.But rain is on the way.“The exceptional weather is coming to an end but we’re not going down the tubes either,” Met Éireann forecaster John Eagleton said.He explained the change in wind direction from south to west will mean a transition to cooler, more showery weather. Nevertheless, the temperatures will still be in the high teens and rainfall amounts will not be above normal.“We’re not going to get lashings of it,” he explained. “It won’t be as sunny as it was, but it will still be very pleasant.”Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry days with temperatures of 16 to 18 degrees - cooler because of the change in wind direction.Mr Eagleton said rainfall amounts over the next 10 days will range from 15mm in the east and midlands to 60mm in the north-west.Some rain is forecast next weekend as there will be more unsettled conditions and southwesterly winds. Monday next week looks like bringing a lot of rain across the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527146.1528753624!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says position on brexit talks has not softened","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Cypriot foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides  welcomes  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nicosia, Cyprus, at the weekend. Photograph: Katia ChristodoulouEPATaoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government has not softened its position on the Brexit talks by conceding that any deal on the so-called backstop to avoid a hard border may not be agreed until October.Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney defended their position saying they have always said the deadline to conclude the withdrawal deal between the EU and UK, including the backstop, was October.The Government has called on the British to show substantial progress on the Border issue by the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of this month but have said that this was not a hard deadline for a deal on the Border.Asked about the risk of no deal being reached given the impasse in talks between London and Brussels, Mr Varadkar raised the possibility of transition periods and extensions if faced with a disorderly Brexit.“It is probably not helpful at this stage to talk about hypothetical scenarios,” he said.The Government wants a backstop keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and single market, which would protect the invisible border and ensuring alignment of regulations north and south of the Border - should the EU and UK fail to agree a trade deal or specific solution for the North.Speaking at the launch of the Global Ireland 2025 report on doubling the Government’s “global footprint,” Mr Varadkar said the UK government’s paper proposing its own version of the backstop was a “small step in the right direction” but he could not accept a backstop that has “a hard deadline”.London’s proposal offered some solutions on customs but did not have enough on regulatory alignment.Mr Coveney, the Government’s lead minister on the Brexit negotiations, attempting to manage expectations around the June summit said it should not be built up “to something it isn’t.”The Government announced plans to open embassies in Ukraine, Morocco, The Philippines and Liberia in the coming years and consulates in Cardiff, Frankfurt and Los Angeles from next year.Mr Coveney said the new embassies were “high potential location for increased trade for Irish companies but also key parts of the world where Ireland’s voice is not as strong as it needs be.”The overseas expansion fulfils a proposal made by Mr Varadkar made during last year’s Fine Gael leadership election. The Government intends to open 26 new embassies and consulates over the next seven years, adding to the existing network of 80 diplomatic missions staffed by 678 diplomats across the globe.The move comes against the shift to protectionism and unilateralism by the US under President Donald Trump and rise of economic nationalism that led to Mr Trump’s election and the UK’s vote for Brexit.“We are at a moment in world history where we can turn inwards and become irrelevant or we open ourselves to opportunities and possibilities on a global scale that we never had before,” said Mr Varadkar.The Tánaiste said the dispute between Mr Trump and other G7 leaders in the aftermath of the weekend summit in Quebec was “very concerning for a lot of people.”“The very public display of disagreement, I think, sends a very unfortunate signal to many parts of the world that desperately need stability from those countries and unity of purpose,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two leaders sign agreement at historic summit aimed at ending nuclear stand-offRocket Man tacos, El Trumpo cheeseburgers, Summit iced teas and customised trinkets are all goAt least six killed in as many weeks over child kidnapping rumours fostered onlineLeaders will discuss denuclearisation of Korean peninsulaAt stake at the summit are North Korea\u0026rsquos nuclear weapons and peace on the Korean PeninsulaUS president keen to showcase deal-making skills in Singapore next weekMysterious illness has sickened consulate staff in city of GuangzhouBeatings, killings, gulags: regime\u0026rsquos brutality unlikely to raised by Trump at summitPresident Ashraf Ghani makes first unconditional ceasefire offer since his electionForeign minister travels to Pyongyang after island of Sentosa chosen to host meetingEmbassy workers in Guangzhou report \u0026lsquoodd sounds\u0026rsquo of kind that struck US staff in CubaBen Lecomte is undertaking the journey to raise awareness of threats to the oceanA week to go until historic summit between Trump and North Korean leaderCommunist Party sees body art as out of kilter with its moral socialist ideologyUS and China have threatened tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion eachThe mooted US-Korea summit is a PR event for three desperate leaders, says Suki KimSterilisations were performed on 25,000 people under a now defunct eugenics lawDeal will end daily exchanges of artillery and missile fire across disputed border in KashmirCountries are trying to settle nuclear disagreements and set stage for leaders to meet"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527062.1528742378!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"social media rumours lead to mob lynching of two men in india","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRumours of children being kidnapped and killed, allegedly for their body parts, spread over Facebook and WhatsApp. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergAt least 16 people were arrested on Monday in India’s northeastern Assam state for their alleged involvement in the lynching of two men following rumours on social media that they were child kidnappers. The arrests followed violent state-wide protests against the killings of Nilotpal Das (29) and Abijeet Nath (30) on Friday evening in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district, 180km east of the state capital, Dispur. The two had gone to a picnic spot in the area to visit a waterfall and were attacked on their return by a mob who accused them of being child abductors. Officials said the attack was prompted by rumours spread via telephone calls and WhatsApp messages that the two were fleeing in their black SUV after kidnapping a child from the area. A video of the attack went viral over the weekend. In it one of the two victims is seen pleading for his life, telling his attackers that he was innocent. “Don’t kill me ... please don’t beat me … please let me go,” were Das’s last words before he was beaten with bamboo sticks and hanged from a tree. His companion was killed in a similar manner. According to local accounts, the people responsible for killing the two men not only filmed one of them begging for mercy, but also posted the videos on Facebook in addition to claiming responsibility for the murders. “The horrific killings stemmed largely from ignorance and the hatred locals harbour against outsiders,” said Ipshita Baruah from Guwahati, near Dispur. Locals had used the allegation of child kidnapping to exert violence against strangers, she added. The authorities in Assam said they were monitoring social media sites to counter those seeking to spread fake news with the aim of fostering panic. State director general of police Kuladar Saikia said some of those associated with the lynching had been identified, but were in hiding. “We are looking for them,” he added.Rumours of children being kidnapped and killed, allegedly for their body parts, spread over Facebook and WhatsApp, have recently gathered momentum across India resulting in at least six people being killed by vigilante mobs in as many weeks. Three people were killed and nine others injured in mob violence in the southern neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana last month in what police claim to be a wave of social media-inspired lynchings. Villagers in both states began nightly patrols following rumours on WhatsApp and other social media platforms that gangs of child kidnappers were roaming the region. In some instances police said doctored video messages, depicting children being snatched from streets, had been circulated, resulting in local mobs beating up and killing people who looked unfamiliar or could not speak the local language or dialect. Local reports of several such killings have also suggested that these were executed to “settle scores” by the victims’ business, social or even political rivals.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has appealed to Conservative MPs for support ahead of two days of crucial votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, warning that a defeat for the government would undermine her negotiating position over Brexit. She told the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers on Monday night to think of the message sent to Brussels if amendments to the Bill approved by the House of Lords are not defeated in the Commons this week.“I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible. But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined,” she said.The Lords approved 15 amendments to the Bill, which repeals the act that brought Britain into the common market and transposes EU law into British law. MPs will debate and vote on the amendments for six hours on Tuesday and a further six hours on Wednesday.The government was working last night on a compromise over an amendment on the customs union, which some pro-EU Conservatives are backing. The Lords amendment calls on the government to report by October 31st on “steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU”. The compromise version being negotiated last night would instead require the government to report on steps to negotiate a customs “arrangement”.Next month, MPs will debate an amendment to a trade Bill that would require Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, and some potential rebels have suggested they will wait for that vote to take a stand.The other amendment that could create problems for Ms May concerns the role of parliament in approving the final Brexit deal. The Lords amendment would not only give parliament a veto over the withdrawal agreement with the EU but a right to issue binding instructions to the government on how to proceed with the negotiations after that.Brexiteers fear that the Lords amendment would allow parliament to stop Brexit by rejecting the withdrawal agreement but telling the government not to leave the EU without a deal. The government has proposed its own version of the amendment, which would give parliament a veto over the withdrawal agreement and the framework for a future relationship with the EU, promising to give MPs a vote on the deal before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.The government’s version would not, however, allow parliament to instruct the government how to proceed with negotiations, instead requiring a minister to report to MPs on what the government planned to do next.Labour has imposed a three-line whip on its MPs, telling them to vote in favour of all House of Lords amendments except one, on remaining in the European Economic Area. The Labour leadership has told its MPs to abstain on that amendment and to vote instead for its own alternative, which calls for full access to the single market.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities.

Emblazoned within a circular motive stating “peace starts in Singapore” was the logo for potcoin – a marijuana-focussed cryptocurrency that is paying for Rodman’s trip to the city state. “Thanks to my loyal sponsors from @potcoin and my team at @Prince_Mrketing, I will be flying to Singapore for the historical summit,” Rodman said on Twitter. “I’ll give whatever support is needed to my friends, @realDonaldTrump and Marshall Kim Jong Un.”Potcoin previously paid for Rodman’s 2017 trip to North Korea, which saw Rodman and his associates appear in Pyongyang wearing t-shirts and hats with the cryptocurrency’s logo. This is despite the fact marijuana is listed as a controlled substance in North Korea, in the same category as cocaine and heroin.Incidentally, it is also illegal in Singapore, where the maximum penalty for being caught in possession of the plant is the death penalty.While Rodman is not travelling to Singapore in any official capacity, he hopes to assist in the talks in any way he can. This is not entirely implausible, given that he is one of a very select group of people to have actually met both Mr Trump and Mr Kim.Rodman knows the US president from his time as a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice in 2009 and 2013 – the same year that he also made the first of several visits to North Korea to meet with Mr Kim.During his second appearance on Celebrity Apprentice, Rodman said Mr Trump wanted to visit North Korea with him, to which Mr Trump responded in a tweet: “Dennis Rodman was either drunk or on drugs (delusional) when he said I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Glad I fired him on Apprentice!”Whether or not Rodman plays any diplomatic role\u0026nbspthis week in Singapore, his trip will serve as a major marketing boost for potcoin – one of more than 1,600 alternative currencies to emerge since the inception of bitcoin in 2009. According to its website, it’s designed as a “network and banking solution” for the global legal marijuana industry. The idea behind it is to facilitate online transactions for the cannabis community in a manner that’s quicker, cheaper and more secure than traditional methods.A single unit of potcoin is worth just 7 cents (5p), while its entire market capitalisation is just over $17m\u0026nbsp(£12.7m) – 0.01 per cent of bitcoin’s $115bn\u0026nbsp(£85bn) market cap.Potcoin isn’t even the only digital currency geared towards the cannabis industry and community. Cannabiscoin claims to be “the marijuana bitcoin”, while dopecoin describes itself as a digital currency for marijuana enthusiasts.“Dopecoin is more than a currency, it’s an experience,” its website states. “Our mission is to provide marijuana enthusiasts with a modern and secure way of doing business for the 21st century.”Neither cannabiscoin nor dopecoin have any significant market value, with combined market caps of less than $5m (£3.5m),\u0026nbspaccording to CoinMarketCap. Even further down the list of altcoins is marijuanacoin, with a market cap of less than $50,000 (£37,300).The success of potcoin’s latest marketing stunt may depend on the success of the talks themselves. Rodman’s 2017 potcoin-funded trip to North Korea resulted in the digital currency plummeting by 23 per cent in value.But beyond legal marijuana and cryptocurrency,\u0026nbspthe most bizarre part of Rodman\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest trip may still be to come: his\u0026nbsplegacy as a peace broker between two sworn enemies.As a\u0026nbspspokesperson for the cryptocurency said: We at potcoin definitely believe that Dennis Rodman deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Sending vulnerable victims of trafficking back to the place they were trafficked from risks pushing them straight back into modern slavery,” she told The Independent.“It also means that victims won’t come forward or ask for help for fear of being sent straight back again. Instead of tackling modern slavery, this risks strengthening the power of the traffickers.”Labour MP Vernon\u0026nbspCoaker, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery, said the current policy was “outrageous” and “totally and utterly unacceptable”.“Immigration policy seems to be riding roughshod over the needs of victims of trafficking. With much of this we’re talking about confirmed victims. These are not people who are playing the system, they are cases where the Home Office themselves have said these are victims of some of the most serious crimes,” he said.“It’s going to put people off coming forward, and it’s going to undermine the government’s own strategy on cracking down on trafficking and modern slavery. If the government is true to its rhetoric around supporting modern slavery victims, this would not be happening.”The Home Office accepted that Mr Nguyen was a victim of trafficking last August. He was released on bail last year and relocated in Glasgow, where he began volunteering for a number of charities, but he was detained again last Monday and issued the deportation notice.He is currently being held in Colnbrook detention centre, in Harmondsworth, awaiting deportation on Thursday.Describing his trafficking ordeal, Mr Nguyen said: “I worked but I had no money. I knew nothing about cannabis. They told me they couldn’t sell it because my skills to cultivate it were so poor.“When I realised it was illegal, in my mind I had a plan to escape\u0026nbspbut I couldn’t\u0026nbspbecause they are gangsters and part of an underground group.\u0026nbsp“They would come in and open the door and then leave again. I had to wake up after midnight to turn on and off the lights and to water the cannabis. I often had to stay up overnight.“I couldn’t get out. The house lacked oxygen – all the windows and the doors had live power on them so I would get electric shocks if I tried to open them.”Eight months into the exploitation, police raided the property and Mr Nguyen was arrested and sentenced to 15 months in prisonThe Vietnamese national described his imprisonment as “hard, but better than\u0026nbspgrowing cannabis,” adding: “I felt more freedom in prison.”Expressing his fear of deportation, the Vietnamese national said: “I feel very nervous. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future. I would be scared to go back because the gangsters will be out to get me. If I was to return I fear I will be killed.”Mr Nguyen’s situation has prompted a renewed push for changes to legislation to ensure adequate\u0026nbspsupport is\u0026nbspprovided to modern slavery victims, after a report by the National Audit Office urged there was\u0026nbsp“much more to do” to ensure victims in the UK are protected.At\u0026nbsppresent,\u0026nbsppeople who are officially recognised to have been trafficked through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking –\u0026nbspreceive no long-term support or automatic immigration status in the UK.Janet Fisher, advocacy manager and a solicitor at anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice, said the number of victims the organisation was seeing being threatened with deportation was “definitely increasing”, and claimed the issue was an as yet uncovered element of the hostile environment policies.She told of one client who\u0026nbspwas recently taken from their safe house, which is\u0026nbspwhere trafficking victims stay after they are rescued,\u0026nbspby immigration enforcement officers in order to carry out their deportation. The removal was later halted after\u0026nbsplawyers intervened.“We’ve had a number of trafficking victims who have been deported and then been pursued by their captors and fled straight back again. It’s a growing problem. It’s one of a number of things which are happening in the hostile environment but are only anecdotal at this point because they haven’t come to light,” said Ms Fisher.“We know that traffickers are mentioning the threat of deportation when they are exploiting people as a way of keeping control. One man was shown his own house on Google Earth by his trafficker to show they knew where he lived, so didn’t want to report the abuse out of fear. There are genuine threats to people.“The government must focus their immigration efforts on the people doing the trafficking, not the victims. But we know there have been many more victims facing deportation than traffickers.”Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, a solicitor from Duncan Lewis who is representing Mr Nguyen, said: “So many people get put off reporting because word gets around and they think if this is how I’m going to be treated, why should I claim?“There needs to be a change in the policy. People are being recognised as victims but then left without status. They’re left with nothing. What’s the point in being recognised as a victim if they’re not going to have any kind of support?”Kate Roberts, head of the Human Trafficking Foundation, echoed the concerns, saying: “There is a conflict between the immigration enforcement and the rehabilitation and victims’ needs, and supporting people to ensure they have a chance to rebuild their lives and not be re-trafficked.\u0026nbsp“It’s symptomatic of the huge focus on immigration control and its prevalence above everything else.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Corbyn has ordered his MPs\u0026nbspto abstain on the matter.That decision prompted fury among pro-Europe\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspin his party, at least 70 of whom are understood to be ready\u0026nbspto defy their\u0026nbspleader in order to vote for the amendment.The Independent understands several ministers and\u0026nbspfrontbench\u0026nbspaides are among the potential rebels, raising the prospect of them either resigning or being sacked.\u0026nbspIn a\u0026nbspletter seen by The Independent, the MPs from pro-Brexit constituencies tell Mr Corbyn not to budge on his commitment to leaving the European Economic Area.\u0026nbsp“We appreciate the significant efforts that you and Keir Starmer, along with his shadow DExEU team, have undertaken to ensure that Labour’s policy reflects our manifesto commitment to accessing the benefits of the single market, whilst acknowledging that freedom of movement must end when we leave the European Union,” they write.“However, we are aware that some Labour MPs believe the Labour Party should back Lord Alli’s amendment, which would seek to maintain Britain within the single market as a member of the EEA.“We will not be supporting the EEA amendment later this week.”They add: “Staying in the\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspwhilst outside the European Union would be the opposite of what the public voted for. There would be a huge democratic deficit, as the UK became a ‘rule taker,’ not a ‘rule maker’.”“Crucially, despite suggestions to the contrary,\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspmembership would require accepting free movement of Labour. Concerns about free movement were an important factor which drove our constituents to vote Leave,\u0026nbspand almost half of all Remain voters wanted changes to free movement. We do not believe these concerns should be ignored.”The letter was coordinated by Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell, Stoke-on-Trent North’s Ruth Smeeth, shadow justice minister Gloria De Piero\u0026nbspand former minister Caroline Flint.It comes as a\u0026nbspdirect response to claims by pro-Europe MPs\u0026nbspthat there would be a parliamentary majority in favour of the UK joining the EEA\u0026nbspif Labour backed it. That suggestion infuriated\u0026nbspLabour MPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave areas, who have made clear they would never vote in favour of EEA membership because it is likely to mean the continuation of freedom of movement – something unacceptable to many of their constituents. Some MPs fear the issue is already costing Labour support among working-class voters.One shadow cabinet source told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “People like Chris and\u0026nbspChuka\u0026nbsphave been saying ‘if only the Labour\u0026nbspfront bench\u0026nbspgot behind the\u0026nbspEEA, we’d win the vote hands down’. That definitely got a reaction from people who were saying, ‘Well, I wouldn’t vote for the\u0026nbspEEA’. There were a couple of\u0026nbspPLP\u0026nbspmeetings where it was very clear that people felt just as strongly against the\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspas they did for the\u0026nbspEEA.”In their letter, the MPs\u0026nbspwrite: “We would also be unlikely to support any future amendment which seeks to keep the UK in the EEA after we have left the European Union, and would not support any change in Labour policy to that effect.“We believe the amendment tabled in your name to the Lords amendment, which is supported by the majority of the PLP, more appropriately reflects Labour policy.”While at least 70 Labour MPs\u0026nbspare expected to rebel against the party line in order to vote in favour of the EEA amendment, others plan to defy instructions and vote\u0026nbspagainst it, causing a major breakdown in discipline as\u0026nbspLabour MPs\u0026nbspsplit\u0026nbspthree ways on the same motion.Sir Keir\u0026nbspStarmer, the shadow Brexit secretary,\u0026nbsphas been holding regular meetings with Labour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave-backing constituencies\u0026nbspto listen\u0026nbspto their concerns. At one such meeting last week,\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare understood to have emphasised the need for the party to stand firm in opposing a deal that would allow continued freedom of movement.Some\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave-voting areas believe their voice has not been fully heard in the public debate and has instead been overshadowed by more vocal pro-EU colleagues dominating the media. The letter is, in part, an attempt to change this.Mr Snell told The Independent: “This is a private letter being discussed with colleagues in town and coalfield seats where voterse supported leaving the EU.“But we are all clear that the EEA is not the model which would work for our communities and would be unacceptable to our colleagues. It is quite clear that the strength of feeling in the PLP is such that even if a dozen Tories were to vote to support the EEA, a majority of Labour MPs would not do the same.”The split\u0026nbspcentres on a cross-party motion passed by the House of Lords that would keep Britain in the EEA – in effect, the single market. MPs\u0026nbspwill vote on the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when the bill returns to the Commons on Wednesday.Labour has refused to support the amendment, with Mr Corbyn having insisted remaining in the EEA would be “not appropriate”. In a bid to offset a backbench\u0026nbsprebellion, the Labour leadership\u0026nbsphas instead tabled its own amendment that would see Britain retain “full access”\u0026nbspto the single market but not join the EEA.The internal row exploded in public on Sunday, when Chris Leslie, a vocal pro-Europe MP, accused Ms Flint of behaviour like leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.\u0026nbspHe told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “The vast majority of Labour members, supporters, voters, all the polling shows ...\u0026nbspwant to stay in the single market because they know in their workplaces, this is going to matter.“Caroline is starting to sound a little bit like Jacob Rees-Mogg with the sort of notion that we should almost go for Brexit at all costs.”Ms Flint hit back: “I think when you are losing the argument, you go to desperate accusations.“I think we are caught in a situation between hardline Brexiteers and hardline Remainers, many of whom want to overturn the referendum result.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The whole thing is keeping Theresa May so busy that she hasnt even had time to check in to this years Love Island villa at all.As the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons for a series of knife-edge votes this week, weve got some help for the Love Island ladies to understand whats really going on in our fight to quit the EU...In short, Hayley, Britain is leaving the European Union.In a historic vote in 2016 Brits voted to throw off the shackles of Brussels and go it alone, taking back control of our money, borders and laws.We officially kicked off the process in March 2017, and Theresa May now has less than a year to negotiate with the EU just how were going to leave, and whats happening next.But, to be honest, its not going all that well for her lately.Last week her Brexit secretary David Davis almost quit over controversial plans for Northern Ireland, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson started mouthing off about the Government at a private dinner and he even said that Donald Trump could get a better deal with the EU.Not ideal. Mrs May needs the next few days to go a bit smoother or she will face more calls to kick her out and replace her with someone new.The EU Withdrawal Bill is absolutely vital to make sure Britain is ready for Brexit.It will transfer all existing EU laws into British law, so there are no gaps after we finally quit the bloc.In essence, its proof to the European Union that we really are leaving and were getting on with it.So come on, lets start talking trade!And if Brussels think the PM is being dictated to by her own MPs it will make Britain look weak at the negotiating table, where were fighting for a decent trade deal.Theresa May needs to win to show shes under control.We must be in a strong position to get what we want - and these votes could bind the PMs hands completely.So far its gone through the House of Commons and passed through to the Lords with just one change to it.Now meddling peers have slapped on a whopping 15 changes to it, which if passed would tell Mrs May what to do in Brussels.These have nothing to do with the EU Bill itself - all this is about is putting EU laws into Britains books.Lords - many of whom voted to Remain - want to water the Bill down and change it to how they want.And if they could, many of them would opt to keep us in the EU after all.Peers in the upper chamber have changed Mrs Mays Bill several times which is causing her huge problems.The main one is on the customs union - which would force the Government to negotiate with the EU to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit.That would help trade flow freely between the EU and the UK - but would also stop Britain striking new trade deals with the rest of the world, removing one of Brexit’s main advantages.Although it would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union, it would make that outcome much more likely.Theres a chance this one could pass, leaving Mrs May weak and defeated.Perhaps the most damaging amendment for the Government’s Brexit plan is a motion to propel Britain into the European Economic Area.The EEA - which includes Norway and Iceland - incorporates the single market, so joining it would force us to continue free movement of people and keep most European laws. That wont fly with most Leavers.Some of the other changes include scrapping Brexit Day altogether (when we will finally exit the bloc), hanging on to EU rights, keeping our borders open to refugees and giving MPs the power to decide what happens if they vote down her final Brexit deal.The Government has also accepted several amendments to the Bill - including that the courts should refer to European Court of Justice judgements when relevant and clarifying the status of retained EU laws after exit dayThe Bill comes back for two days to the House of Commons tomorrow and Wednesday.They are set to have six hours to debate the changes and then vote on whether to accept or reject them.By tomorrow night well know whether these changes have been made.Most of them Mrs May is set to win - as they do have a majority in the House of Commons with the help of her coalition pals - the DUP.Their 10 MPs - who have promised to support her - will secure the votes needed for most of them to pass.But some Tory rebels are threatening to go to the other side and vote against her on some of the changes - like the ones on a vote on our Brexit deal, and the customs union plans.These ones are likely to be much, much closer, and will cause real problems if they are lost.The Government has already put down a number of concessions to plead with the MPs to come back onside, but will it work? Who knows.At the end of last year 11 Tories voted against the PM and issued a damning defeat on her.Its likely the same group could cause trouble again.They include leading Remainers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who all want the PM to compromise more.But leading rebel Ken Clarke yesterday admitted that the threat of rebellions was melting away because Tory MPs feared that inflicting government defeats this week would topple Mrs May after the turbulence of last week.Gosh, if only it were that easy.Some of these MPs are incredibly stubborn and think the changes to the Brexit Bill are more important than voting with their own leader and respecting the result of the referendum.Tonight the PM will issue a rallying cry to all Tory MPs to show the public they will deliver on Brexit ahead of the crunch votes tomorrow.She will make a crucial address to a meeting of all 316 Tory MPs in a last ditch bid to stave off a damaging rebellion over the Government’s Brexit plans.Yes, Brexit is still happening, no matter what happens at the end of these votes. Sorry, not sorry, Remainers!But they could totally change what Brexit looks like, and it could mean an utter betrayal of the result for millions of Leave-backers who wanted us to take back control.Staying inside a form of a customs union could mean having to accept thousands more people coming freely into Britain with no checks.Two years after the referendum, plenty of people are unhappy that ministers are STILL squabbling over the ins and outs of what our position is.After these crunch votes are done, some are warning shell face a leadership challenge and another top Tory will swoop in to take her place.If she loses them, a new Prime Minister could come sooner than you might think."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412303625.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"magnet fisherman finds safe full of jewellery watches and medals at bottom of lake","story":"Adam Hastings, 22, was unemployed when he decided to try magnet fishing for the first time and pulled up a stolen safe containing watches, necklaces, war medals and sentimental items.Magnet fishing involves using a strong magnet on the end of a line to pick metal objects out of water.Adam bought his magnet online for £17.50 and used it to fish in Pittville Lake in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.He also pulled up another large magnet, suggesting that thieves had dumped the safe in the lake and then tried to come back for it.Adam said: “I cast it in about four or five times without any luck,” explained Adam.“Then I felt something on the end line and when I pulled it out it turned out to be a safe full of jewellery.“As I was reeling it in people started looking so I asked a woman walking a dog to film it for me.“It was obviously from some kind of robbery.I found another smaller magnet nearby so it appears they came back to get it but the magnet they used wasnt as powerful as mine.The safe and its contents have been handed in to police, who will reunite the stolen treasures with their original owner.Adam says although the watches have been ruined, brooches and military medals appear to be wearable - though it is unclear how much they are worth.He decided to try magnet fishing after seeing a TV programme about the hobby.He said: “It looked like an interesting thing to do that didn’t cost too much money and would get me out and about.“I didn’t expect to find treasure the first time though.“It just shows what’s out there.

But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”Government minister Robert Buckland, who is in charge of the bill, added: “We all hang together or we all hang separately”.Downing Street had feared rebel Tories would unite with Labour today to enforce a symbolic victory with warm words about keeping the UK in a customs union.But the Europhiles promised to vote with the government instead last night when it agreed to instead report back to the Commons on the progress made on “a customs arrangement”.MPs signing the new amendment include Brexit-backers Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Benard Jenkin and former-Remainers Nicky Morgan, Stephen Hammond and Sir Oliver Letwin.Brexiteers’ leader Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the amendment as part of a “new collegiate spirit” in the party.But rebel leader Ms Morgan said the new customs amendment would “buy time” for Tories who still want to stay in the Customs Union.In a second compromise with Tory rebels, ministers have also pledged to enshrine in law today a meaningful vote for MPs on the final Brexit deal before the European Parliament validates it.In exchange, the rebel will agree to sink another powerful Lords amendment – pushed through by former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Hailsham - that would have seen control for the talks with Brussels handed over to Parliament.It emerged last night that the government could still suffer a devastating defeat today on another Lords amendment, despite theSix Tory rebels are still unhappy with ministers’ offer on a meaningful vote on the final deal, and are demanding more powers forBut No10 have insisted that Brexiteer MPs will not allow the PM to go any further on letting the Commons and Lords alter the eventual deal’s shape.The stand off could go right down to the wire when MPs vote on Lord Hailsham’s amendment at around 4pm today.The six are Ken Clarke, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Sarah Wollaston are holding out.They are insisting that Parliament must be able to dictate what happens next if Mrs May’s deal is voted down, meaning No10 would have lost control of the Brexit negotiation and Brussels will be effectively dealing with MPs from then onwards.If passed today, it would even have given the Commons and Lords the right to halt Brexit altogether.In a more lighthearted moment during the PM’s 1922 meeting, senior Tory backbencher Keith Simpson suggested Mrs May shoot warring Cabinet Ministers Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond.The backbencher urged the PM to host a paint-balling fight to settle Cabinet differences at the Chequers away day next month.And he joked that former Army Officer and Tory MP Johnny Mercer “could provide you with some live ammunition if you want it.”A grinning PM thanked the MP “for his helpful suggestion.”As many as 12 pro-Brexit Labour MPs are also thinking about abstaining today to help the government’s numbers.Labour Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer last night urged MPs to come out in force against the Government on both the customs union and meaningful vote because of “wavering” by would-be Tory rebels.He told MPs he was concerned about reports Tory rebels may now fall away as there were only likely to be “two crunch votes”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They say the country will become a bureaucratic basket case.That is baffling news for the port workers in Felixstowe.Their system is so efficient that some EU containers, arriving on non-EU ships go through the processing system anyway as it is so painless.Shipping journalist Dean Cable explains: “Some politicians say leaving the EU will be bad for us but it doesn’t have to be and Felixstowe proves that.“Goods come and go without fuss, whether they are from inside the EU or not.”No wonder Brexit naysayers never mention this place when they talk about Britain’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.They would prefer you to think that if we left the customs union, lorries at Dover and Folkestone will be stuck in queues 30 miles long.Our haulage industry will grind to a halt, they claim, and Britain will be gripped by food shortages.But anyone who visits the port of Felixstowe will quickly realise that is utter baloney.For a start, it deals with 25 times more trade than the entire Irish border — which handles £3billion a year — and does so without a hitch.Across the 8,360-acre site on Friday afternoon, things are busy, but calm — without a customs officer in sight.Down at the docks, the vast vessel Marie Maersk, newly arrived from Sri Lanka, was being unloaded by crane, with no complicated paperwork.Dean tells me that it is the 11th largest container ship in the world, capable of holding 18,270 containers. All have come from outside of the customs union but will be on the road within the hour.Felixstowe is proof that leaving the customs union will not be the logistical disaster that some warn it could be.Figures show an estimated 98 per cent of non-EU crates pass through the port of Felixstowe as quickly and easily as goods that arrive from within the EU.This is because the non-EU goods have cleared customs before they even reach Britain thanks to a digital cargo-tracking system called Destin8.Tax officials at HMRC monitor every single non-EU container ship using the system, working out the tariffs and duty owed. Intelligence gathering and data analysis helps identify 80,000 of the four million containers to be searched and monitored for any infringements.People who work in the freight industry are adamant that Felixstowe’s systems can be adapted for Ireland.They say no hard border would need to be built and trade can continue as before.And it will not cost billions of pounds nor take years because everything is digital.Jason Flower is managing director of KWL Logistics and chairman of the Felixstowe Port Users’ Association, an independent trade body which represents 115 warehouse keepers, shipping lines and hauliers — some with business interests in Northern Ireland.Although he voted Remain, he said: “Brexit will work. It’s got to work. The public voted out. Get on with it.”Asked whether there is any need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he says: “Not with documentation nowadays. All they care about is the movement of the cargo and the duties and taxes involved. I don’t see the need for a hard border because everything is digital now.”In Felixstowe, adding EU trade to the Destin8 system could be achieved in a matter of minutes. Alan Long, chief executive of MCP, the company behind Destin8, says: “It would probably involve a few extra keystrokes.”No wonder people in the town of Felixstowe are baffled by Remainers’ obsession with the hard border.“My husband’s a crane driver at the docks. I’m sure talk of a hard border is nonsense.”Prominent Brexiteer and Labour MP Kate Hoey, who is from Northern Ireland, told The Sun: “All this talk of creating a border is ridiculous. There is already a border. The Irish Republic has a different currency, different corporation tax and excise duties. But it isn’t an infrastructure border.“The only people talking about creating a trade border are either Remain politicians trying to undermine Brexit or Sinn Fein politicians using Brexit as an excuse to try to split Northern Ireland from Great Britain.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.There’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

He also analyses Irish border ­protocol, the cost of customs clearance and how we can ­maximise Brexit opportunities.Under the proposed New Customs Partnership, the UK would collect tariffs on all imports into the EU regardless of whether they are then exported to EU27 ­countries or are meant for UK consumption.If goods are only for UK consumption, then importers may claim a rebate. This option was voted against in the Brexit Cabinet but seems to have a zombie-like resiliency so cannot be discounted entirely.It would mean the end of UK independent trade policy and be disastrous for prosperity.No, it’s not lippy. Max Fac is short for maximum facilitation, referring to the process of creating a border between the EU and the UK which is as frictionless as possible.This is achieved by waiving duties on goods and employing technology-based solutions to ensure smoother border crossing.The customs facilitation chapter will ensure both sides mutually recognise each other’s trusted trader programmes – something the EU does with many countries – and optimise the customs process.The Irish border problem has been a crunch point, with some claiming there would have to be border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.But it is not insurmountable.Some sort of customs checks on goods crossing the border would be needed, but not necessarily passport checks or everyone being stopped.The use of technology is very important — it is ­constantly improving, lowering customs barriers.Much has been made of the cost to businesses of completing customs declaration forms after Brexit.Estimates as high as £20billion have been doing the rounds but a more ­realistic figure is closer to £4billion or £5billion.The whole point of Brexit, from an economic perspective, is to offset these losses with the gains from an independent trade policy.Economic studies suggest an improvement of EU regulations to US levels would lead to a gain of 12.6 per cent of GDP (approximately £250bn for our economy).The actual costs of leaving the customs union and single market (tariffs, clearance costs and the costs of lack of regulatory recognition) need better context.With customs, the costs of clearance in terms of increased form-filling is dwarfed by the opportunities that better regulation at home, and reducing barriers abroad, can achieve. Of course we should minimise these costs — and “max fac” is designed to do just that.But we must also understand what the opportunities are for the country. Our policies should pursue these opportunities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Led by Caroline Flint, the Brexit-backing MPs have sent a stinging letter to Jeremy Corbyn urging him not to bow to pressure from pro-EU colleagues.EEA membership gives countries such as Norway and Liechtenstein access to the single market, but they have to accept unlimited EU immigration and EU rules and regulations. Jeremy Corbyn wants his MPs to back separate Labour plans for a bespoke Brexit deal that would guarantee the UK full access to the single market.But leading Labour backbenchers including Chuka Umunna, Mary Creagh and Chris Leslie, are among the 70 expected to defy him.The tension on the Labour benches erupted on Sunday when Mr Leslie had a bitter TV dust-up with Brexit-backing Caroline Flint.After saying Ms Flint of sounding like arch Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg, she accused him of sounding “desperate”. Ms Flint - a former Labour Europe Minister - was one of a cluster of Labour MPs from Leave constituencies urging Jeremy Corbyn not to bow to pressure from Europhiles.In the letter, the MPs, including Gareth Snell, said backing EEA membership would force the UK to continue to accept unlimited EU migration. Another split emerged as the TSSA Union became the first Labour affiliated union to call for a referendum on the Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.One source told The Sun: “The party is split two to three ways. And it’s great fun for the Corbynistas – they’re watching the MPs who wanted him out scrapping with each other.”Sir Keir Starmer met a group of Europhile Labour MPs before he addressed the full Labour Parliamentary Party.One insider said he hinted Labour could move closer to backing EEA membership next month when both the Government’s Customs and Trade Bills go before the Commons.The UK Chamber of Shipping urged MPs to reject any Norway-style deal.The trade body said: “We cannot allow the UK to become the only major economy in the world to have no say in the rules and regulations its economy lives.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it won\u0027t just make or break her premiership - it could have a huge difference to you, your family, and your everyday life. That\u0027s because in a string of votes, MPs will choose whether to carry on with the Prime Minister\u0027s current Brexit plan or make it much, much softer. Mrs May is pulling out all the stops to prevent a Tory Remainer revolt that would scupper her Brexit talks, and leave Britain closer to the EU. The drama will take place on Tuesday 12 June and Wednesday 13 June.  It\u0027s all centred around 15 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill , which is Mrs May\u0027s flagship law enacting Brexit. If the amendments pass, they could keep us in the customs union and very nearly in the single market - forcing us to stick to EU rules. This is the opposite of what the Prime Minister wants.  These amendments aren\u0027t the end of the road - there are more votes on customs next month - but they\u0027re a huge step along the road. So we\u0027ve gone through all 15 to explain simply what they mean. Enjoy!  What were the 15 defeats to the EU Withdrawal Bill? Your Brexit votes bingo card MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 as Theresa May tries to overturn 15 defeats to her Brexit law. The amendments, passed by the House of Lords, would push Britain towards a softer Brexit if they are not blocked by the House of Commons. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. Who\u0027s voting on what, when? To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a list of the original 15 Lords defeats to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they\u0027ll achieve if they pass. For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of these will be defeated, some could pass. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through.  Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. It could force her back to the negotiating table instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment.

The Prime Minister was asked whether it was time for a “full police inquiry” following reports that the millionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks had more extensive contact with the Kremlin than previously acknowledged.  It comes as Mr Banks dismissed reports of links with the Russians in the lead up to the 2016 referendum as a “smear”. According to the Sunday Times, Mr Banks - the Leave.EU founder who helped bankroll Nigel Farage’s campaign - held a series of undisclosed meetings with Russian embassy officials around the time of the 2016 referendum campaign. The paper said it had seen emails showing he also discussed a potential business deal involving six Russian gold mines with ambassador Alexander Yakovenko after being introduced to him by a suspected Russian spy.  The billionaire said a witch hunt against Russian power had begun after Donald Trump’s election victory and the vote to Leave the EU.  Speaking alongside his former aide Andy Wigmore on Nigel Farage’s LBC radio show, Mr Banks said: “It was only when Trump won and there had to be a reason why he won - and Brexit.” The pair admitted having lunch with the Russian ambassador twice - one of which was described as a “boozey lunch” where they drank vodka, brandy and wine - as well as a later meeting over a cup of tea.  And the pair admitted sharing the phone number for Trump’s transition team, who helped set up his White House, with the Russian ambassador, among other officials. But Mr Wigmore denied receiving any money for the Brexit campaign saying there was “not one penny or rouble” donated by the Kremlin to Leave.EU. And Banks dismissed calls for a police inquiry asking “what is the crime? I’d like to know what the police are going to investigate - lunch with the Russian ambassador?”  Although the billionaire did accept there may have been some attempts by Russia to influence the outcome of the referendum on a “low level”. Earlier today in the House of Commons, Labour former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw asked Theresa May to launch a full police inquiry into the alleged links.  He said: “Is it not now time for a full police inquiry into the relationship between the Kremlin and the Leave campaign in the EU referendum ?”   But the Prime Minister said that it was a matter for the police to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. Former Labour minister Liam Byrne echoed calls for a proper investigation. He said: “I think the majority in this House will welcome the overwhelming majority in the G7 not to let Russia back to the top table. But Russia is now seeking to exert its influence through the back door and we learnt about the scale of that over this weekend.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 15 becomes first internet","story":"NewsBoy, 15, becomes first to have internet gaming addiction recognised by NHS after missing a year of schoolKendal Parmar’s son was kept in hospital for eight weeks and has missed a year of school because of his “all-consuming” addiction\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin20:12, 11 JUN 2018Updated20:56, 11 JUN 2018NewsMum Kendal Parmar has battled for three years for help after her son\u0027s condition became so severe he stopped going out (Image: Geoff Pugh)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA boy of 15 is set to be \u0026shydiagnosed as the first NHS-recognised internet gaming addict.

David Richardson had been released from prison just a few weeks before he died, having developed an addiction to the drug. Despite being caught using Spice two dozen times in jail, he was released early from a four-year sentence, still in the grip of the drug. His inquest heard evidence from the probation service that ‘it was agreed that if he could remain drug free for two months, consideration would be given’ to release on licence. However, David was freed in November - weeks after the last time he was caught. Just over a month after that early release, David was dead.   In his final letter to his mother, written from prison, he described how much he was looking forward to seeing his two children, Manchester Evening News reports .  “How my little (beauties) doing. I don’t half miss them...I can’t wait for this Christmas. We’re gonna have a good’en.” The prisoner and his mother, Maureen, had a plan for Christmas Eve. “I was getting him a Santa suit,” she says. “He was going to come to my house on Christmas Eve, and then see his children to surprise them with presents.” But on December 22, 2016, David was killed. He walked up the M602 at Eccles, at night, and then on an unlit stretch of the M60 at Junction 12, Worsley, where he was hit by a car. A year-and-a-half on, Maureen is adamant that her son was too dependent on Spice and other drugs to be released from prison, and cannot understand how the authorities thought he was fit for release.  While a pupil at St John Fisher Primary in Woodhouse Park, and then St Paul’s RC High in Wythenshawe, David got his nickname - ‘Milky’ - due to his likeness, as a blond lad with round glasses, to The Milky Bar Kid in the chocolate TV advert. It was a name which stuck with him for life, until it ended, aged 36. It was even used on the order of service for his funeral. Maureen is the first to admit that for much of his adult life, her son was no angel. His transformation from the innocent, well-dressed boy, shown in his picture for his confirmation into the Roman Catholic church, to a drug-dependent, disturbed young man was tragically swift. His drug use began at the age of 16, smoking cannabis. But by his early 20s he was using heroin. He turned to theft to finance the habit, picking up more than 20 convictions. But it was Spice - the drug notorious for its dramatic effect on vulnerable users - that took him to his lowest ebb.  “I saw him in prison and I was really worried about him as he was so thin,” Maureen says. “I found out he was selling his dinners in prison and his food to get Spice. “He had to take ‘slaps’ - which is where he gets beaten up by other prisoners and then the assault gets put on Youtube. Your reward is you get Spice. “He was receiving threats at one point while in prison. Some drugs were dropped in the exercise yard by a drone. David picked them up and was supposed to be looking after them for somebody in his cell. “But, being David, it was like putting a kid in a sweet shop. He took all that Spice himself and ended up owing a drug dealer over \u0026pound1,000.” At his inquest, Maureen learnt that between April 2014 and October 2016, David was caught using Spice 24 times in prison. “The 24 times were only the times he was caught using it. I think he was using it daily,” Maureen says. Spice was designed as a synthetic alternative to cannabis. But its effects are much more dramatic than the drug it was designed to mimic. Leaving users in zombie-like catatonic states and triggering psychotic episodes, users have said it is stronger than heroin and crack cocaine. It has gained popularity with vulnerable populations - the homeless and prison inmates - in the last five years, and for a period could be legally bought in shops.  By the time it was outlawed in spring 2016, many were hooked. For someone like David - who was diagnosed in 2009 with depression, pyschosis, and schizophrenia - being introduced to Spice was disastrous. He had shown himself to be capable of beating drugs before - but each time would be pulled back in by bad company. “In his mid 20s I got him to move up to near me in Bolton,” Maureen says. “We got him a little job, because I live near a village and he worked in a pound shop. He loved that job and stopped using hard drugs. “But then he moved back to Wythenshawe and started taking crack cocaine. I used to see him periodically and didn’t realise how bad he had gone.” It was that cocaine addiction that led to David committing robbery and being jailed for four years. But in prison he got no chance to get clean, because Spice was readily available. Following his release from HMP Risley in Warrington, the deterioration in David’s mental health and the extent of his drug problem was apparent. On morning of the day he died, David admitted to hostel staff that he had taken diazepam which was not prescribed to him - breaching the conditions of his licence. Maureen said: “That day, in my opinion, they should have phoned an ambulance with a view to him being sectioned for his own safety. It was known that diazepam had been a trigger for his offending in the past.” In the early evening of December 22, David left the hostel by climbing along the rear wall. He was seen on the M602, where cars dodged him. Great Manchester Police’s helicopter was scrambled to look for him. But at about 7.40pm he was struck by a car.

The family went to watch Prince William play in the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire - and it looks like they had a brilliant day. There are lots of pictures of adorable Prince George and Princess Charlotte running around, rolling in the grass and playing just like normal kids. Royal fans particularly loved one photo of Kate, dressed in a blue \u0026pound39 Zara dress, running across the pitch. But a closer look shows she\u0027s not actually running to meet Wills, but she\u0027s actually rushing to see one of his pals.  Malcolm Borwick played alongside the prince for the charity match, and he\u0027s been good friends with William and Harry for a long time. Kate was then spotted giving Malcolm a kiss on the cheek and a hug.  Malcolm was standing outside a marquee with some of the other players and supporters when Kate ran over. He looked very happy to see her and Princess Charlotte and had a huge smile on his face.  Prince George showed of his impressive artistic skills during the event, and was proudly walking around with a lovely picture of a volcano. However he\u0027s also sparked a huge debate after being spotted playing with a toy gun. Princess Charlotte could be seen running around wearing an adorable patterned dress and sunglasses. It appears the littlest Cambridge Prince Louis stayed at home for the day.  Sunday\u0027s fun day out couldn\u0027t have been more different to Saturday, when the family took centre stage for the Trooping of the Colour parade . The event, which celebrates the Queen\u0027s official birthday, is one of the most important events in the royal calender and sees the whole gang stand on the Buckingham Palace balcony to wave to well-wishers and see the flypast.

Worried parents have raised concerns about the hugely popular app, which has reportedly caused issues in children as young as seven. Teachers say the violent game is behind an increase in poor behaviour by students and is distracting pupils from their work. One school in Bristol issued a warning to parents on their Facebook page about the dangers on the video game, the Daily Mail reported. It wrote: “We’ve heard some of our children, including in Year 3, are playing a game online called Fortnite ... if your child is playing this game talk to them and make sure you know what they are doing.”  A school in Stoke-on-Trent also sent a letter to parents saying discussions about Fornite are so common in classrooms that they are distracting children from their learning. Concerned MPs have also waded into the argument and say more must be done to enforce age restrictions online  Nigel Huddleston, who represents Mid Worcestershire for the Conservative Party, said he was ‘horrified’ to hear stories about the game. He said: The Government is going to be making it increasingly difficult for children to see inappropriate content. Fortnite, which can be downloaded for free to mobile phones or computers, pits gamers against each other in a battle-type scenario, only finishing when only one player is left alive. Its exaggerated gameplay and cartoon-like depiction of violence has resulted in it becoming one of the internet\u0027s most popular games. Over 40 million have \u0026shydownloaded the so-called \u0026shysurvival shooter game since it was launched last July, sparking \u0026shyrecord numbers of digital addiction.

He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem.

It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part.

Peruvian sanguches, completos and pl\u0026aacutetano mixto have been tipped as some of the foods that are likely to disrupt the fast food scene across the world. Hispanic takes on hot dogs and doughnuts have also been cited as potential disrupter franchises. Western franchises have dominated the fast food sector across the world up to now, with McDonald’s, Burger King and Subway among the biggest companies in the world. Krispy Kreme was launched this century and now has over 400 sites across the US, with the doughnuts also widely supplied in garages and convenience stores around the world.  But recent research published in the International Business Review suggests the global franchise picture is changing. The research focused on the huge expansion of Brazilian franchises as well as others in Latin America. And according to Leonardo Gonz\u0026aacutelez Dell\u0026aacuten, the fast food scene is ripe for expansion. He said: “The bottom line is that franchises that originate in emerging markets are doing better in other emerging markets than ones that originate in more economically developed countries (MEDCs).  “This is because these businesses do not see high levels of corruption or inefficiencies in doing business as unacceptable obstacles to opening up. “Indeed, the evidence suggests that Brazilian franchise chains, in food and other sectors, do not see corruption as necessarily inhibiting their ability to do business in emerging markets and the least developed countries in Latin America. “In short, they are better able to deal with problems around contracts, complex or contradictory regulations and political instability.  “More generally, emerging market multinationals (MNEs) are more prevalent in less developed countries compared with traditional MNEs – they turn their own experience into a competitive advantage. “With these business experiences behind the teams who have made a success in the Latin America look set to take the world by surprise”.

The paramedic has told how he spotted the youngsters sweating away inside a sealed parked car as temperatures hit 27C. Fearing for their safety, he noted the registration and went inside the store in Lydney, Gloucestershire, to alert the driver. But he claimed he was told by a security guard that the information could not be used because of data protection. Tesco has told him it will investigate the incident. The paramedic returned to the car and was about to call police to tell them he was going to break in to save life when the children\u0027s mother returned. At a starting temperature of 27C, the heat inside a sealed car is likely to exceed 38C within 20 minutes. After half an hour it could be approaching 48C.

He wrote: “My wife, daughter and I popped in for a few bits following a day out. “We parked in one of the parent and child spaces and immediately noticed the black car next to us with two unattended young children in it, sweating away. “The thermometer in our silver car read 27C so I can’t imagine how hot they must have been sealed in that black car.  He added: I immediately went to a member of staff who was in the car park, he took the registration and went to do an announcement for the parent. “We also mentioned it to the security guard. Very worryingly his response was, ‘Oh we can’t do anything about that for data protection reasons\u0027. “He then stopped the other member of staff from taking any action. He then said he would look into it. “I was waiting for an announcement to come out whilst we did our shopping, but nothing ever came.

Five people were rescued from the unlicensed boat, which sunk moments after the collision.

The talks are set to one-on-one, with translators the only other people allowed in the room. The meeting comes after North and South Korea held their first summit in more than a decade. It was only the third meeting between the leaders of the two countries since the Korean War. Amongst the announcements at the end of the historic meeting was a pledge to sign a formal peace treaty to end the war. Until now, the two countries have technically still been at war, despite the conflict ending in the 1950s. South Korea\u0027s president Moon Jae-in, who came to power in May, and the North Korean dictator also committed to \u0027denuclearisation\u0027 in the peninsular.  The divisions between the two countries stretch back to the end of World War II, and are based on political ideology as well as bloody conflict. And while the South has flourished in recent years as a democracy supported by the United States, the North has seen isolation from the international community and has pursued an aggressive military-first policy. Here\u0027s an overview of the origins of the divide, the bitter war that cemented it, and their differing fortunes since.  Japanese rule and World War Two The short-lived Korean Empire had been integrating more with the Empire of Japan at the end of the 19th Century, and by 1905 a treaty formally made Korea a protectorate of Japan. Japan annexed the country with another treaty in 1910, officially taking over sovereignty of its land and people. A Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was set up in exile in China by those opposed to Japanese rule. In Korea, a series of anti-Japanese protests were put down by soldiers, and over the next decades Japan strengthened its military rule of the peninsula. Following the Sino-Japanese war of 1937 and the outbreak of World War II Japan\u0027s rulers cracked down on Korean culture, and stopped the teaching of the Korean language and history.  During World War II , tens of thousands of Korean men were conscripted into the Japanese military. Up to up to 200,000 girls and women, mainly from Korea and China, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers as so-called comfort women. The Provisional Government organised resistance groups against the colonial rulers. In 1940 the Korean Liberation Army was formed as the government declared war on Japan and Germany. Japan surrendered in 1945 after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the Second World War.  Following the unconditional surrender of the Japanese, the victorious Allies split the Korean peninsula into two occupational zones. The United States took over the area to the south of the 38th Parallel, while the Soviet Union took the area to the north. The original plan was to work towards a united independent Korea, but the Soviet-US joint commission overseeing the transition failed to come to agreement as Cold War tensions between the two superpowers deepened. Fearing communist expansion in the region, the US established a military government in the south, while the Soviets oversaw the formation of the Provisional People\u0027s Committee led by Kim Il-Sung in the north.  In the north, land was redistributed amongst the people, and key industries were nationalised. The US military government said hundreds of thousands fled south as refugees. By 1947, the US brought the issue of what to do with the peninsula to the UN, against the wishes of the Soviet Union.  The UN passed a resolution stating that free elections should be held and foreign troops withdrawn. The Soviet Union boycotted the vote. Elections were planned in the south only, but strikes and protests broke out as activists feared separate elections would lead to the permanent division of the country. An uprising against the plans by Jeju islanders from April 1948 was met with force by the South Korean military, resulting in up to 30,000 people being killed - around 10 per cent of the island\u0027s population. The general election went ahead in May 1948, and in August, the Republic of Korea officially took over from the US military. The first president, anti-communist Syngman Rhee, had previously been head of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In response, in September 1948 the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea was declared in the north, with Kim Il-Sung as leader. Both governments claimed sovereignty of the whole of the Korean peninsular. Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, while US troops pulled out in 1949. The Korean War On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel and headed south following a string of bloody border clashes between the two countries. The North Korean military was well-equipped by Stalin\u0027s Soviet Union, and contained veterans from the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. They advanced with tanks and heavy artillery along the border line. In contrast, the South Korean military was poorly equipped, had no tanks and few aircraft. The invasion was the first major military action of the Cold War, and two days later Rhee fled South Korea\u0027s capital as the North Korean army swept across the country.  As Seoul fell, retreating South Korean forces executed tens of thousands of alleged communists held in prisons, as well as suspected communist sympathisers who had been enrolled in the Bodo League - a \u0027reeducation programme\u0027. It is estimated up to 200,000 people were massacred by South Korean forces. On June 27, the UN passed a resolution recommending that member states provide military support to South Korea. North Korean forces overran 90 per cent of the south before the US-led counter attack, and on September 25, South Korean forces retook Seoul.  South Korean units crossed over the 38th Parallel on October 1, with UN forces following a week later, pushing north until they reached the border with communist China. In November, the Chinese entered the war, and together with the North Korean army forced the UN forces back south. In 1951 the war ground to a stalemate near to the 38th Parallel, but fighting wore on for the next two years while armistice negotiations continued. American bombing destroyed huge numbers of buildings in North Korea, crippling the country\u0027s infrastructure and forcing the population to build homes and factories underground.  The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. It created a four-kilometre wide buffer zone between the two states, called the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The new border crossed the 38th Parallel diagonally, and reflected the position the two forces held at the end of the war. A peace treaty was never signed, and both governments still claim sovereignty across the whole peninsula. The conflict resulted in the death of more than 2.5million people. After the war and the Kim dynasty  Autocratic South Korean President Syngman Rhee remained in office until 1960, when a student uprising forced him from power. After a period of instability, General Park Chung-hee seized control in a military coup and ruled until his assassination in 1979. It took until 1987\u0027s June Democracy Movement for South Korea to move away from an autocratic system of government. The country was invited to join the UN in 1991. It hosted the Olympics in 1988, and the World Cup - jointly with Japan - in 2002. The current president, Moon Jae-in, was elected in 2017.  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung concentrated his power after the war, executing dissenters and building a personality cult around himself. He was nicknamed Great Leader and the population was taught to venerate him. It is Kim Il-sung\u0027s policy of \u0027Juche\u0027 - political independence and economic self reliance - that has remained the country\u0027s ideology to this day, and has resulted in its isolation from the global community.  Until the 1960s, economic growth in North Korea was greater than that of South Korea. By the late 1980s, however, the economy had slowed, and it came close to collapse in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell and aid was suddenly cut off. Il-sung died in 1994 from a sudden heart attack, and supreme power passed to his son Kim Jong-il. His son continued the personality cult of his father, being declared Dear Leader and promoting a \u0027military first\u0027 approach.  The North Korean economy under Kim Jong-il was devastated by a massive famine, with hundreds of thousands of people dying from starvation and disease, and the nation left reliant on foreign aid. The country has still not recovered, with a US delegation in 2011 estimating that a third of children there are malnourished. North Korea became more insulated. Kim Jong-il died in 2011, and his son Kim Jong-un took over as leader.  According to South Korean reports, Kim may have purged more than 300 leading figures from the government to secure his position of power. These include Defense Minister Hyong Yong Chol, who was reportedly killed with anti-aircraft guns in 2015  security minister O Sang Hon, who was reportedly executed with a flamethrower in 2014  and Kim\u0027s uncle Jang Song-Thaek, who it is claimed was eaten alive by 120 starving dogs . He is also believed to have ordered the fatal poisoning of his half-brother , Kim Jong-nam, at an airport in Malaysia in February 2017.  North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions began in 1963 under Kim Il-sung, when the government asked the Soviet Union for help in developing a nuclear weapon. The request was refused, but the Soviets agreed to train scientists for a peaceful nuclear programme. Its first research reactor came online in 1965, and a second was built in 1979. In 1994, North Korea came to an agreement with the USA to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, but Kim Jong-il\u0027s government admitted in 2002 that it had continued the research. The North Koreans insisted the presence of US nuclear weapons based across the border in South Korea justified their secret weapons development. Meanwhile George W. Bush\u0027s US administration named North Korea as part of an Axis of Evil alongside Iran and Saddam Hussain\u0027s Iraq. In 2006 North Korea announced that it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test. It carried out further tests in 2009, 2013 and two in 2016. In 2017 the country carried out its seventh test, and claimed it was a hydrogen bomb capable of being launched on an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Alongside the development of nuclear warheads, North Korea has been developing the missiles needed to deliver them. In tests at the end of 2017, its Hwasong-15 missile travelled 621 miles and reached an altitude of 2,796 miles. The country described it as the most powerful it has fired to date. In response, President Donald Trump branded Kim Jong-un as \u0027rocket man\u0027, later saying: It is a situation we will handle. We will take care of it. In his 2018 New Year address, Kim hit back at Trump, saying “It’s not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office ... All of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.” Trump replied with a message on Twitter, tweeting: Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger \u0026amp more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Peace talks and hopes for denuclearisation "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e50909d517-471x564.jpg ","title":"can you help dundee community centre seeks more volunteers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee community centre is looking for more volunteers.The Circle, located in Staffa Place, is seeking people keen to make a difference in the community, learn new skills and gain experience.As well as providing spaces for organisations to work, The Circle hosts regular lunch clubs, groups for older people, community gardens and event space for community groups.A spokeswoman said: “We welcome volunteers with all kinds of skills.

I’ve been experiencing a high volume of emails and calls regarding complaints about the services.“The public pay their council tax and expect the bins to get emptied.“You used to have the issues with tenements having multiple wheelie bins out on the street. At the moment it is turning into a city-wide issue.“People are doing the hokey cokey with their bins.”Resident Raymond Dunsmuir, 51, said this was the “worst disruption” he had seen to the waste collection service since moving back to the area in 1996.He said: “I contacted the council last Friday and they said the collection was running late.“We never had any issues like this before the changes – it’s just been a shambles.“The grass and other garden waste is going mulchy and creating a smell.“As far as I’m concerned the delays in collections are down to cutbacks in the staffing levels.“I feel sorry for the team members who are getting over-stretched with the work they are doing.”Another resident said he believed that although council tax is going up, the service is getting worse.He said: “The area is stinking at the moment because the waste hasn’t been uplifted.“The reason for this has to be as a result of cutbacks.“I honestly feel the council tax keeps going up and the service is going in the opposite direction.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said the local authority is dealing with an “exceptional” amount of green waste this year resulting from a wet spring followed by a sustained period of warm weather.He said: “There was a near-40% rise in green waste delivered to the Riverside composting site in May compared to the same period last year.“We are dealing with a situation where many homes in Dundee have multiple brown bins.“Additional resources are being deployed to catch up with collections. In the meantime residents are asked to leave bins out and they will be uplifted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances.

I wouldn’t like to see it brought down in any way so hopefully this new development can be a good addition.”When built, both the ground and first floors of the Caird Hall were used for retail units.This was a stipulation put in place by Sir James Caird – the original funder of the project – who believed that retail spaces would be essential to offset the cost of running the hall.The building was gifted to the-then Dundee Burgh Council.The McManus now houses Champion the Wonder Horse, which took pride of place in the City Arcade – opened in the ground floor of the Caird Hall from the 1930s.The City Arcade closed in 1981, having gone into decline when the bus stance was removed to make way for the construction of Tayside House.It was then used as the main council housing office until the move to Dundee House.As well as Brassica, St Andrews Brewing Company will also be moving into the City Vaults with plans for a £1 million restaurant.The company signed a lease for two units in the basement earlier this year.Brassica aims to offer an informal dining experience similar to restaurants in Copenhagen and New York.It is expected that 30 people will be employed by the company as part of the new development.General manager Nikos Matsikas said: “Our staff are really looking forward to welcoming the first customers to Brassica.“Apart from sourcing as many ingredients as possible within 50 miles, Brassica will also be environmentally friendly, using no plastic.“I have worked around the world and Dundee is one of my favourite cities.“I look forward to introducing more people to it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"local actor and director to bring acclaimed show to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFife-born actor, director and musician Cora Bissett is bringing her latest production to Dundee.Bissett will direct a new production of Gagarin Way at Dundee Rep Theatre between October 16 and November 3.Set in Fife, Gagarin Way addresses the departure of socialist values from a region where political radicalism was once the cornerstone of the community.The play was written by Gregory Burke and first appeared in a theatre in 2001.It follows disillusioned computer factory workers Eddie and Gary who have a plan to make the ultimate political statement — kidnap a member of senior management and send a message to the world.Their plot starts to unravel when security guard Tom stumbles in on them.Worse still, the kidnapping hasn’t quite gone to plan.Gagarin Way is described as offering a stark insight into the harshest realities of Scottish society, tempered with fiery black humour.Among the venues to have hosted productions of the play are the National Theatre and the West End in London.Bissett is best known for her musical Glasgow Girls, which followed a group of activists that took up an ethical fight against the deportation of asylum seekers who had settled in Scotland.She is also recognised for writing the music for the stage version of Emma Donoghue’s book Room and in 2014 she became a part-time associate director at the National Theatre of Scotland.For tickets and more information about the play, visit dundeerep.Doors for some performances open at 2.30pm, while others are at 7.30pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

I’m sure that full hotels, restaurants and attractions will be just some of the benefits derived from hosting the WUKF World Championships.“It shows what a changed city Dundee is and how our reputation and our ability to punch above our weight can deliver results, and provides an opportunity to promote our values and offerings on an international platform.”Kanzen Karate, based at Manhattan Works, put in the bid to host the WUKF World Championships in 2016.Roy O’Kane, Kanzen Karate president, said: “We’ve been working with partners across the city — Dundee City Council, Leisure and Culture, Dundee and Angus Convention Bureau — to make it a success and we can’t believe it’s here.“The response across the city has been immense. There is a lot of goodwill and support for the event.“Dundee Ice Arena is going to be rocking for four days, so much so we’ve had to add a 100-metre temporary marquee to the front.“Some of the federations who bid for these events have 60,000 members, whereas we’re 600.

The retired training aircraft is now only usually flown for the owner himself or his friends and associates.Tracking Yusuf down through a Facebook appeal, Mr Gibbs was impressed by his enthusiasm when they finally met.\"He goes out in all weathers and in all seasons \u0026ndash this boy is keen, just like I was,\" he said.\"I made contact and offered to get them airside and show them around the hangar, with particular emphasis on his favourite machine, the Jet Provost.\"A former Highland Airways and Flybe captain, Mr Gibbs now works on contract in China but lives near Dalcross.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Tuesday 12 Jun 2018 9:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

is run by the department for digital, culture, media and sport, and successful cities will trial new 5G technologies for residents and businesses.The bid follows the announcement in February that Aberdeen is to become Scotland’s first gigabit city through a £40 million investment from CityFibre.The company, working in partnership with Vodafone, is to deliver full-fibre broadband throughout the city.Co-leader of Aberdeen City Council Douglas Lumsden said: “Our ambitions are for a smart city where technology is the driver for a prosperous future for residents and businesses.“Digital infrastructure is vitally important to realising that vision and already significant progress is being made.“There is a real determination to build on the foundations already in place and this bid is an example of that forward-thinking attitude.“There will be stern competition – but we believe Aberdeen has a compelling case.”Aberdeen’s bid, supported by organisations including the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce and Aberdeen Inspired, will focus on the city’s reputation as a pioneer of new technology.Mr Lumsden added: “Aberdeen’s future success depends on technology being an enabler, not a barrier.“Users increasingly demand seamless access – so fixed and wireless connectivity has to evolve to meet those requirements.“5G has a major role in that and it would be fantastic

pointless.“It’s damaging the environment for those who use these facilities.“The council invested a lot of money into refurbishing play parks across the city so it’s disappointing.“When things like

memorial.The former footballer, who helped the Dons clinch the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1983, passed away on May 28 after being found injured in a stairwell at a block of flats in Aberdeen.Around 4,500 fans – along with most of the Gothenburg Greats – packed the Richard Donald Stand last night as the club paid tribute to the man supporters called a “proper Aberdeen loon” and “a great man”.Applause rang out at the end of the night as 220 red and white balloons were released into the blue sky above Pittodrie, each symbolising the 220 games Cooper played for the club.Earlier in the day his friends and family paid their respects at a private funeral service, but they joined fans at Pittodrie to say goodbye to the popular player.Friends from the footballing world, including Joe Harper, Willie Miller, Craig Brown, Archie Knox and Andy Dornan, shared touching and funny stories about life with Neale, who was known as Tattie.Former Evening Express sports editor Charlie Allan also shared his memories.Son Alex Cooper, nephew Doug Blake, fan Jock Gardiner and childhood friend Paul Alexander also brought tears to the eyes of supporters with their memories of the former Airyhall Primary and Hazlehead Academy pupil.One of the fans in attendance, Iain McDonald, 70, of Bridge of Don, still has his original Gothenburg ticket from May 11 1983.He said: “It’s sad, very sad that he was the youngest and he was the first one to go. I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"head gardener appointed at aberdeen royal infirmary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to create a staff garden at an Aberdeen hospital have taken a step forward with the appointment of a head gardener and new design ideas for the space.The idea for the garden, located at Aberdeen Royal Infimary, was conceived after the success of the site’s Robertson Family Roof Garden.A dedicated staff-only facility, it will be accessed via swipe card and will be available 24 hours a day.Similar to the Robertson Family Roof Garden, which opened in 2016, the garden will be charitably funded and maintained.It will be located in the internal quadrangle, off the main corridor of ARI – which is currently home to the Grampian Hospitals Art Trust portable buildings.It has been designed to act as a space where staff can enjoy fresh air during their breaks and improve their health and wellbeing.The project, which it is hoped will be completed next year, has now appointed Diana Robertson as its head gardener – she previously filled the same role at Drum Castle.NHS Grampian’s healthcare chaplain the Rev James Falconer is spearheading the project.He said: “We are making progress although we are still at the very early stages.“We’re very pleased to have Diana Roberston as our head gardener – she will be excellent.“We also have some exciting plans for the design of the garden.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why?

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day. Kim added: “Our cake was made by a friend who is a cake maker, Diane Kay. “We didn’t really have a clue about a cake so we just sent Diane some pictures and trusted her to make us a gorgeous cake and we were not disappointed!  “We had a white three tier cake with silver and diamant\u0026eacute lace trim, it fitted the wedding theme perfectly and was absolutely delicious.” The couple added: “Thanks to all the staff at the Vu for an absolutely amazing day. “Kevin the photographer, Waterfront the band, Winton Weddings for our stunning decor, Susan from Opus Couture for helping me chose my stunning dress and all our friends and family who attended the wedding and made it the most perfect special day! “My best friend, Shelby McAllister for being right by my side for the full day and keeping me calm in the lead up to the wedding. “And last but not least - my Grampa Willie for walking me down the aisle and making all my dreams come true!” For more photos of this week’s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

The group all started in 1992 and would have all left by 1998. Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again. They have booked the Marine Hotel on Saturday, July 28 and ex-pupil and DJ Steven James will spin the decks. Lynda added: “Many people have their tickets already, some who live locally like Vicki Cameron, some from a bit further afield, like Ed and Kim Wood (Carmichael) and others are travelling from outside Scotland like Hannah Izod (Green) who now lives in England, Neil Lockie of Florida and John Brisco in Hong Kong.” Tickets costing \u0026pound25 include three-course meal and welcome drink and can be bought at the website marr92 and Lynda and fellow organiser Mhairi Lammie were on the yearbook committee of the time and are seeking photos for a slide show to be sent to atreunion1992@outlook "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12662348.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_010618dom.jpg","title":"prestwick tennis superstar learning disability","story":"NewsPrestwick tennis superstar with learning disability climbed Goat Fell for charityDominic Iannotti, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet14:45, 7 JUN 2018NewsDominic Iannotti Prestwick Tennis player (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRising tennis star Dominic Iannotti made a mountain of cash by climbing Goat Fell. The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dinghy sailors delight at record may weather","story":"It particularly suited sailors at Campbeltown Sailing Club\u0026#8217s (CSC) reinstated Wednesday evening sessions organised by Kintyre Seasports Project\u0026#8217s Sid Gallagher.The action continues this Wednesday, from 7pm and all are welcome, especially total beginners, as all specialist equipment is provided.CSC\u0026#8217s Iain McGlashan said: \u0026#8216It is another good forecast for this Wednesday so some along if you can.\u0026#8216Wednesday evening sailing continues until  28 June.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.

While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).

It is understood that TPG and Poundworld\u0026rsquos management rejected offers to buy the business out of a pre-pack administration, and were hoping to sell it as a solvent business.  Other parties named as possible buyers were turnaround specialist Alteri Investors and Poundworld\u0026rsquos founder Chris Edwards.  But a deal could not be struck.  Poundworld\u0026rsquos losses widened in 2016-17 to \u0026pound17.1 million, from \u0026pound5.4 million of losses the year before.

I was playing football with a few of my friends at the local pitches. The rage that hit me as we were knocked out of the tournament was like never before. I can remember being so angry that I kicked the bags next to the goals containing our stuff, smashing a friend\u0026rsquos phone screen in the process. The rest of the boys were laughing as I was going ballistic and this was all over a game of football \u0026ndash I regret it to this day but looking back it was just what I\u0026rsquod needed.  I knew at this point that there was something wrong with me. For the rest of evening, I said nothing apart from apologising to my friend about his screen and offering to pay for a new one. I had never wanted to cry so much in my life but I held it together as I didn\u0026rsquot want to totally embarrass myself in front of my friends.  As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs, avoiding any conversation with my family. I knew exactly the person to ring, my gran. She was the best listener anyone could have hoped for \u0026ndash always looking to help anybody out. I poured my heart out, told her every issue I\u0026rsquod ever had in the run up to this point whether it be substance abuse, entire summers spent solely in my room or the fact that my confidence with girls was at an all-time low. I didn\u0026rsquot particularly want to do anything or go anywhere, even pulling out of a boys\u0026rsquo holiday with some of my best friends.  I was spending days at school, working at McDonald\u0026rsquos at the weekends and not enjoying a single minute of it. Rejection from Heriot-Watt University. Rejection from IKEA looking to upgrade my part-time job made me feel like a total loser.  I\u0026rsquod been made Head Boy at Penicuik High School but felt like a below average student and kept saying that I\u0026rsquod been appointed because \u0026ldquothe staff felt sorry for me.  As I sat there, blubbing away, my gran told me to see a doctor. It was her that took me to my first doctor\u0026rsquos appointment and then counselling session. We\u0026rsquod had my future counsellor, obviously I didn\u0026rsquot know at the time, from MYPAS (Midlothian Young People\u0026rsquos Advice Service) speak to the school and I had previously put my name down on the sly but the doctor arranged an appointment sooner for me knowing that I was in trouble.  The counselling was great. It\u0026rsquos an experience that I went into with the most pessimistic approach possible. I couldn\u0026rsquot have seen how talking to a complete stranger who didn\u0026rsquot know me, my family, friends or girlfriend was in any way going to benefit me given she couldn\u0026rsquot put names to faces and wouldn\u0026rsquot know them if she bumped into them in the street. My counsellor, Angela Robb, was excellent and didn\u0026rsquot care about them, this was about me and what I was going through. I saw her for 12 sessions, because when I\u0026rsquod got to the end of my initial 10, I felt as though I wasn\u0026rsquot necessarily \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquo yet so she was able to provide me with more sessions.  Robb said: \u0026ldquoCounselling is unique to each client and whilst there are some common factors in every therapeutic relationship, I tailor how I work, taking my lead from each person. It\u0026rsquos key to successful counselling to be able to form safe and trusting therapeutic relationships. I feel that I do this and my client\u0026rsquos outcomes and feedback suggest this is true.  But it was not only me going through such a horrendous ordeal. Some of the statistics and facts are alarming. According to menshealth, 9% of men go through depression on a daily basis, more than 6 million men. On top of that, 3 million men are hit with a form of anxiety every day.  Why is this the case? I spoke to Jane Anderson, a mental health nurse at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.  \u0026ldquoI have been a mental health nurse for eight years and have probably nursed hundreds of patients, some you\u0026rsquoll never see again and others I\u0026rsquove nursed several times. As difficult as it can be some days it is also very rewarding.  Anderson says: \u0026ldquoWe are a recovery focused ward and building a therapeutic relationship initially with patients can be challenging. However, when there is an understanding that our goals are the same \u0026ndash ie to get a better level of health and be discharged \u0026ndash working alongside a patient developing care plans to suit their individual needs and treating people with respect. I don\u0026rsquot expect thanks but even seeing someone smile when they have been so unwell is a fantastic feeling.  She said there was still an unwillingness among men to admit that they have a mental health issue. \u0026ldquoBy the time they are admitted either informally of formally [sectioned under the mental health act] there is some recognition from the person that they are unwell. In the community, however, stigma is still very prevalent. The perception that males are raised to be stoic, brave and strong further enforces this belief.  I asked her what factors could lead to compound mental health issues. \u0026ldquoLack of knowledge and understanding, embarrassment, feeling of failure, fear of letting others down and looking weak, Anderson said. \u0026ldquoThis can be a generational issue, older males are less likely to be open about their mental health, younger males are more open although don\u0026rsquot necessarily accept it.  Although there is more discussion of these issues in society than ever before, I began to wonder what more could be done to raise awareness. I asked Anderson if she felt that men could be reached by information during entertainment and sporting events.  She said: \u0026ldquoI suppose the \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo is that mental health isn\u0026rsquot a nice happy topic so would turn people off from watching. We live in a consumer society, happiness and laughter brings viewers and readers and makes money for the big television and media companies.  I\u0026rsquom a huge football fan and it amazes me when I see people literally living my dream who aren\u0026rsquot entirely satisfied and perhaps feel that they never will be. The cases in Scotland with David Cox of Cowdenbeath who was taunted by a rival fan, \u0026ldquoAway and hang yourself and do it right this time, and James Keatings (formerly of my beloved Heart of Midlothian) recently sharing his battles on Twitter despite playing for three of the country\u0026rsquos biggest clubs. Even a Barcelona academy graduate, Bojan Krkic, came out and said: \u0026ldquoI had anxiety attacks but no one wants to talk about that. Football\u0026rsquos not interested.  That speaks volumes to me about the prevalence of mental health problems. Krkic has graduated from one of the leading academies in world football, has played in several of Europe\u0026rsquos major leagues (Spain, Italy, England, Germany and the Netherlands) and has presumably amassed a healthy standard of living through an astronomical wage but still suffers.  It\u0027s not a new problem. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was said to have reportedly experienced severe depression and supposedly contemplated suicide, often weeping uncontrollably. A key figure in the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, was seemingly psychotic, and prone to dramatic mood swings with numerous authors suggesting he was bipolar or schizophrenic. Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most famous artists of all time, was another affected. His enthusiasm for art came along with his fast-paced painting followed by deep depression and an apparent bipolar disorder.  In more recent times, many in the entertainment industry have committed suicide due to mental health problems. Frightened Rabbit\u0027s singer Scott Hutchison and the actor Robin Williams are all examples of people who, seemingly with the world at their feet, who have taken their own lives. It should never have to be this way.  Some may see suicide as the brave way out but the most courageous act you can take if you are suffering is to do something about it yourself and surround yourself with a loving family, supportive friends and people that ultimately want to put you right.  And, please, please, get help.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.  He said: \"This would leave local councils picking up the pieces, running the very few loss-making routes whilst transport tycoons line their pockets on the rest of the bus network.\"  Green MSP John Finnie said: \"While we are pleased the Bill includes provision for local authorities to provide their own bus routes in areas where communities have been left behind by private operators, it is disappointing that it does not allow for the re-regulation of buses so that local authorities can choose to bring all bus services under public ownership.  \"There\u0027s also not a single mention for trains. This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/610721.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Nae Guid Eneuch  Private schools shun Scots history for GCSEs","story":"              A recent BBC-comissioned YouGov survey shawed that aroon 61% o Scots got their sense o identity fae their kennin o the History o Scotland.

A major report on schools in the developed world said staff rotation in Japan and Korea helped spread innovative teaching techniques.  The OECD report also highlighted cash incentives as a way of attracting the best teachers to schools in deprived areas.  And there was a boost to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos policy of giving more power to headteachers.  The Effective Teacher Policies report said letting schools hire staff - a key plank of Education Secretary John Swinney\u0026rsquos reforms - led to improvements in pupil performance.  The report said: \u0026ldquoCountries with strong centralised traditions of teacher management could consider creating a mobility requirement, such as exists in Japan and Korea.  \u0026ldquoToo limited mobility of teachers between schools ... can hinder the spread of new ideas and approaches.  \u0026ldquoBy introducing a requirement for teacher mobility every five to seven years might stimulate continuous professional growth while also ensuring that effective teachers are fairly distributed across schools.  The report said opponents of school autonomy often voiced concerns that greater independence would lead to an education system that exacerbated economic and social inequities.  But it added: \u0026ldquoIn fact, many countries have been able to combine extensive autonomy with strong incentives to ensure schools prioritise student learning.  \u0026ldquoIf school leaders have some freedom to adapt teachers\u0026rsquo responsibilities, working conditions and pay to reflect the difficulty of tasks, they are better able to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms.  \u0026ldquoOn average increases in school responsibility for selecting teachers for hire were associated with improvements in student achievement.  However, the report warned against giving more power to headteachers over hiring of staff too quickly.  \u0026ldquoSchool leaders\u0026rsquo capacity to manage human resources cannot be created overnight, it said.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said moving teachers between schools could be disruptive for staff and children.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod prefer the priority to be making sure every school has the teachers it needs and that those teachers are of the highest calibre.  Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\u0026rsquo Association, said the union would be interested in discussing the idea.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers should be encouraged to work across different schools to gain experience and pass on knowledge.  \u0026ldquoHowever, those who move across schools would need to be paid for the additional responsibilities and experience.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union highlighted another of the report\u0027s findings - that countries which paid the highest salaries had fewer difficulties recruiting.  He said: \"Improving salaries is essential in making teaching a more attractive and desirable career option for highly qualified students.  \"In Scotland, teacher salaries have been eroded over the past decade.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said its education reforms were focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are based on international evidence of how high-performing education systems work \u0026ndash delivering extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Landmark surgery helps baby boy to reach his first birthday","story":"              Little Noah Connell\u0026rsquos parents were told several times that their baby boy was going to die.  With rare facial deformities which mean his life is at risk every day, the tot has undergone eight gruelling operations in his young life - including one surgery which was the first of its kind anywhere in the world.  Even swallowing his own saliva or a drop of rain could kill him, but against all odds the determined toddler has survived to celebrate his first birthday.  His parents, Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, said was a \u0026ldquomassive milestone for the whole family.  Miss Gordon, from Robroyston, Glasgow, said: \u0026ldquoWe were told on numerous occasions that Noah wasn\u0026rsquot going to make it.  \u0026ldquoFor anyone, their baby reaching one is a big deal, but it was a bit bigger for us because we have had so many hurdles to overcome.  \u0026ldquoHe had a birthday party with all our friends and family at a soft play area and then went to Blair Drummond Safari Park, who set up a special visit for us.  \u0026ldquoIt was really emotional, it\u0026rsquos amazing how much he has come on in the last year.  \u0026ldquoIt is a massive milestone for us and Noah. \u0026ldquo  Noah\u0026rsquos arrival into the world was a massive shock to his parents as Miss Gordon didn\u0026rsquot know she was pregnant.  She was suffering from bad stomach pains which turned out to be labour.  However, her surprise quickly gave way to worry as it became clear that something was wrong with the baby.  Doctors knew instantly that something was wrong with Noah, who was born \u0026ldquolooking like he had no jaw.  His condition, known as hemifacial microsomia, means the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally.  He also has Pierre Robin syndrome \u0026ndash a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems in feeding and breathing.  He has a small neck, floppy airway and cleft palate and part of his spine is also missing.  The toddler\u0026rsquos condition is so severe that he cannot eat or drink because of the effect on his airway.  He is fed through a gastro tube and he can only have 620ml of a high-calorie solution every day to help him pile weight on and grow.  His mother explained that even being sick or swallowing a drop of rain could be enough to kill him.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen he was born he looked like he had no jaw at all.  \u0026ldquoHe can\u0026rsquot eat or drink. Even one drop of rain could be fatal for him.  \u0026ldquoAnd we spend hours giving him a bath because it\u0026rsquos so dangerous.  \u0026ldquoLast weekend Noah was sick and choked He went purple and stopped breathing for between 10 and 30 seconds. We were blue-lighted to the hospital.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos scary but it\u0026rsquos just our normal - he is a happy wee boy.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how to feed a baby or make a bottle up. But dealing with tubes and wires are all normal to us because we don\u0026rsquot know any other way.  However, the family still has hope that Noah\u0026rsquos miracle surgery will allow him to eat and drink normally in the future.  The life-saving operation took place at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Children on March 8 and involved metal rods being inserted to his tiny face to help secure the bones and allow him to breathe.  The surgery, called mandibular jaw distraction, saw doctors break his jaw in two places, with the rods being put in place to straighten his face and push his tongue forward.  It was so rare that surgeons had to send to Germany and the US for parts and consulted with other experts to decide if the operation was even possible.  It is hoped that the \u0026ldquoscaffolding will eventually move his jaw forward and help to reduce his chances of choking.  For three weeks after the surgery Miss Gordon and Mr Connell had to learn how to turn the screws in the metalwork \u0026ndash a process that has to be done with exact precision.  Jade, who cares full time for Noah, said: \u0026ldquoSince his surgery, his jaw has moved forward 4cm which should loosen up his airways.  \u0026ldquoThe surgery has worked as well as it can do just now and the movement in Noah\u0026rsquos jaw is a big improvement.  She added that both she and Mr Connell were shocked to learn that he could be the first person in the world to have the revolutionary surgery, but had no choice but to place their trust in the medical staff.  \u0026ldquoWe asked the doctors if we could see pictures from other surgeries like the one Noah was going to have, she said. \u0026ldquoBut they said they couldn\u0026rsquot.  \u0026ldquoWe couldn\u0026rsquot believe it when they said Noah would be the first baby in the world to have the operation.  \u0026ldquoIt was daunting to hear that but we trusted them.

The latest report by the Charities Aid Foundation reveals that there has been a 50 per cent annual rise in donations to charity last year with the total given crashing through the \u0026pound1 billion barrier.  But the CAF said it was of \"some concern\" that there was a slight dip in the number of people giving money to charity year-on-year and that the rise is the result of the same number of people giving more, with the typical donation going up from \u0026pound36 in 2016 to \u0026pound60 in 2017.  It is believed the drop may be the result of a drop in trust in charities.  It comes as experts in the third sector earlier this year warned\u0026nbspin February that donations to Scottish charities could be damaged by the Oxfam sex scandal and public trust could be hit hard.  Oxfam workers in Haiti were accused of paying prostitutes and holding \u0026lsquoCaligula-style\u0026rsquo orgies, with participants allegedly including under-age girls, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake there.  It was then\u0026nbspalso alleged that the charity knew about concerns over the behaviour of Oxfam\u0026rsquos country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, in a previous posting in Chad.    Figures released by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in February showed that trust in charities had dropped by nine per cent over the last two years.  The SCVO findings prompted the group to launch a new campaign called I Love Charity, amid evidence that donations were being hit.  The CAF\u0026rsquos Scotland Giving report says Scotsgave an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to charity in 2017, up from the\u0026nbsp\u0026pound813 million donated in 2016.  It also said that in 2017, 63 per cent of Scots questioned claimed to have donated money to charity compared to 65 per cent in 2016.  The CAF survey report said: \"This leads to a key policy question about how to encourage giving and whether it should focus on getting more people to give or getting those who give to give more, or indeed, a combination of both.\"  Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) said: \u0026ldquoThe findings from CAF\u0026rsquos report are fairly positive as they show that although the number of people giving has decreased, the amount of money being donated to charities in Scotland has gone up, which is great.  \"Figures released by SCVO in February 2018 showed that while trust in charities in Scotland is still high, it has dropped by nine per cent over the last two years, which may help explain why the number of people giving is down.    \"However our survey also showed that trust in local charities remains strong, particularly where people had personal experience of a charity, so it may be that the increase in giving is down to the impact of the good work organisations do in communities.  The Institute of Fundraising said the dip in donors may be because charities are focusing on giving \"existing supporters an even better experience\" instead of concentrating on attracting new supporters.  Alex Close, head of Scotland at the Institute of Fundraising, said \"We\u0026rsquore pleased to hear that the generosity of the Scottish public continues and it\u0026rsquos great to see a rise in the donation amounts that people in Scotland say that they have given.  \"The increase is likely to be caused by a combination of factors, rather than one single reason, including people feeling more financially secure, or a great experience with a charity that inspires them to increase their regular donation.    \"Many charities have been focusing even more on giving existing supporters a great donor experience and inspiring them to increase their regular donations. We hope that this generous trend continues and the Scottish public continue to give to good causes. \"  CAF found that Scotland accounts for 11.8 per cent of all UK charitable donations, despite representing 8.4 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos population.  It found that the most popular causes supported by those in Scotland were children and young people, with 28 per cent of those surveyed saying they had donated to this cause. This was followed by medical research (27 per cent) and animal welfare (25 per cent). The report also found that two in three (66 per cent) of people took part in a charitable or social activity, such as volunteering for a charity, donating money or goods, or buying an ethical product.  More than half (56 per cent) of those interviewed said they signed a petition in the previous 12 months, while 27 per cent had done so over the previous four weeks.  The report is based on a a survey of 1061 people in Scotland.    Sir John Low, Charities Aid Foundation chief executive said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the total amount donated increasing across Scotland. Activism is also on the rise, perhaps re\u0026#64258ecting the turbulent times in which we live. This paints a picture of a thriving, vibrant society of which we should all be proud.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to take the work of our charities for granted \u0026ndash indeed CAF\u0026rsquos research over many years shows that millions of people benefit from their work without even realising it. But this report shows how much people value good causes. Without the support of these generous donors, we would all be so much the poorer."},{"url":null,"title":"Country walks  spas and fitness suites    welcome to the perfect place to retire","story":"              IT has been billed as Scotland\u0026rsquos first purpose-built retirement community and is predicted to change the way people live in their later years when the worries of work are behind them.  Plans have been unveiled for a new village designed to cater to the needs of the over-55s, with all amenities, facilities and services they require right on their doorsteps.  Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.  Investments would be made in the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents.  Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  An independent economic impact study of the project estimates that the development will support more than 365 permanent jobs during the next 30 years, and contribute more than \u0026pound74m to the local economy .  It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.  The development would be built across the road from Whitecraigs Rugby Club and immediately adjacent to the M77 motorway. A similar scheme was refused in 2015, after objections from the community, social health and care partnership and Glasgow Airport.  Glasgow based practice Jewitt \u0026amp Wilkie Architects has been appointed to design the development. Founder Jonathan Jewitt said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out thorough and extensive research on aspirational, high quality homes and engaged with numerous public and private bodies to achieve the optimum scheme proposal.  \u0026ldquoThis proposal includes a wide variety of unique features which have been subtly future-proofed to cater for the changing needs of residents.  \u0026ldquoIt is expected that housing currently occupied by one or two persons within the surrounding community will be released into the market for much-needed family housing."},{"url":null,"title":"Edinburgh wants to oust Sydney as best place to see in New Year","story":"              AS the first major city to welcome in the New Year, Sydney proudly boasts that it is hosts the most talked about party in the world.  But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Bottle or breastfeeding  Woman   s choice must be respected  midwives told","story":"              Women who decide not to breastfeed their child must be respected for their choice, midwives are being told.  Updated advice from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) stresses that new mothers should be given appropriate support if they make an informed decision to bottle feed.  The new guidance still says babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their life, in line with advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO).  But the RCM has acknowledged that some mothers struggle to start or carry on breastfeeding, and says the decision is a woman\u0026rsquos right.  Chief executive Gill Walton said: \u0026ldquoEvidence clearly shows that breastfeeding in line with WHO guidance brings optimum benefits for the health of both mother and baby. However the reality is that often some women for a variety of reasons struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding.  \u0026ldquoThe RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice.  \u0026ldquoIf, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected.  The National Childbirth Trust has previously warned that women can face judgment or feel guilty about the decisions they make when it comes to feeding their baby.  But the RCM says it recognises that \u0026ldquosome women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed.  \u0026ldquoThey must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby, Ms Walton added.  \u0026ldquoWe know that every woman wants the best for her baby and we want to be able to empower our members to support women to be the best they can be and enable them to make decisions that are right for themselves and their babies.  The organisation also says those who choose to breastfeed need more support and should not feel \u0026ldquoguilty of embarrassed about breastfeeding in public.  Research has found breastfeeding can have long-term health advantages, with children less likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.  But the UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world. A recent report found just over a third (34%) of babies are receiving any breast milk at six months, compared with 62.5% in Sweden."},{"url":null,"title":"MPs to question leading Brexiteer Arron Banks over Russia links","story":"              Prominent Brexiteer Arron Banks has insisted there is no evidence the anti-EU campaign took Russian money as he faces a grilling form MPs.

The Royal Court Theatre\u0027s artistic director has curated eight filmed monologues for a BBC Four series to mark 100 years of suffrage as a collaboration between the theatre and the broadcaster.  But Featherstone, former artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland, was as surprised as anybody when the BBC agreed to the suggestive title Snatches, which can be used as a derogatory slang term for a vagina.  She told the Radio Times magazine: \"It\u0027s reclaiming the word, isn\u0027t it?  \"It was my first idea, and I thought, \u0027There\u0027s no way they\u0027re going to let it happen,\u0027 but they (BBC Four) were rather amused by it.  \"And in terms of what we\u0027re doing with the monologues, it fits very well.

Featherstone said that each writer was able to make their own decisions as to what their stories, which will air in 15 minute-long episodes, would be about.  One of the monologues will be based on rape within marriage, while another - starring Garai and penned by Morgan - is about an actress\u0027s experience meeting a producer.  Featherstone said that working on the series has been a bit of a wake-up call in terms of gender equality.  She said: \"I\u0027m an incredibly optimistic person, but I think the shock, for all of us who worked on Snatches, is that things maybe haven\u0027t changed as much for women as we thought they had.  \"We think that everything has changed - and lots of change has happened - but we still have a gender pay gap, we still don\u0027t have equality, because equality, for some, feels threatening.  \"Snatches shows how things can shift.
