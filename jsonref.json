But he found life hard.‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj says.         ‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj (pictured) saysIn 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben, and his three sons came to England. Raj recalls the moment he arrived as a teenager, speaking no English. ‘London was very beautiful and very clean. It was so different from our village in India, where we only had electricity for a couple of hours a day.’From the day he arrived in Thatcher’s Britain, Ashok worked as a grocer, initially with his brother in a corner shop in Tottenham, North London, before saving enough to open his own: Lena Stores in Islington, which he took over in 1998.Yes, the customers came to Lena Stores for groceries, but mostly for Old Mr Patel, who would dispense free lollipops to children and gossip to their parents and grandparents.The shop itself is tiny, about a quarter the size of a typical Tesco Express. The freezer cabinet filled with Magnum ice creams, bags of peas and (very good value) £1 garlic bread baguettes, has a handle held together with gaffer tape.The lino floor is scuffed. The superglue is stacked next to the Patak’s vindaloo sauce, and the balls of garden twine are shoved into a cardboard box along with large nail brushes, a shower mat and some 13-amp, three-way mains adapters.But amid this chaos lies a staggering array of food, drink and household essentials. It is a microcosm of all that is best — and surviving still — in Britain’s high streets.Not the Britain of self-service tills and chains selling vapid coffee.No, the Britain of quirky independent shops, run by dedicated, hard-working families who choose to open their doors and serve their customers — even when they are grieving.Napoleon may have meant it as an insult, but Britain still is a nation of shopkeepers — just. Nearly one in ten people in Britain works for a shop and the retail sector makes up five per cent of the British economy.         In 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben (pictured together), and his three sons came to EnglandOf course, most of our groceries are bought from one of the big four supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons. But there are thriving corner shops, despite all predictions they would be killed off by internet shopping and the march of the supermarkets.Of the 46,388 convenience stores in Britain, about 33,000, or nearly three-quarters, are independent, according to the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). That number has fallen in the past few years, but not dramatically so.‘About 15 years ago, all the prophecies were that there would be no more independents left. That’s definitely not happened,’ says James Lowman, ACS chief executive.True, more and more convenience shops are now owned by a big supermarket chain. ‘But it’s a very slow move,’ Lowman adds. ‘The best shops in Britain are still run by independent shopkeepers, who are close to their customers.’And few were closer to their customers than Ashok Patel. After he died — he was fully diagnosed with cancer only last month — a tribute was posted on a local online message board and it triggered an outpouring of grief that was immediate and heartfelt, giving lie to the idea that there is no sense of community in inner-city London.The residents felt they had lost not just a local shopkeeper but a pillar of the community.One, Emily Grazebrook, said: ‘When I first moved to the area ten years ago, my husband and I had very little money, as we had put it all down as a deposit for a flat.‘I went into Lena and asked if they would take a cheque for some groceries. Ashok and Raj welcomed me to the neighbourhood and told me to put my cheque book away — I could pay them when money came in the following week. I was so moved by their kindness.’         When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells meThat struck a chord with me. If I ever nipped out to get some vital missing ingredient and then found I’d forgotten my wallet, Old Mr Patel always told me I could pay him later. He never kept a tally of all the credit he trusted that you’d remember — which I would sometimes do, with a pang of embarrassment, only days later.When we moved into the street, my eldest child was just six, my youngest not born.But all four of my children have taken their first crucial steps to independence by being sent to the end of the road to buy cereal or a loaf of bread, knowing Mr Patel would help them find the item and count out the correct change. They were always safe there.When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells me. ‘And we have seen so many grow up. When they first arrive, we can’t see them from this side of the counter.’Toddlers barely able to peer above the rack of Kit Kats and Lion bars, but soon old enough to buy stationery or their first can of beer before going off to university.‘Many of the naughty teenagers who have caused trouble grow up and come in later to apologise to us,’ he adds. But there was one incident when the youths were more than just naughty: they were dangerously violent.One December morning in 2012, three men, aged 25, 22 and 18, entered the shop, drunk, wielding knives and intent on stealing alcohol and anything else they could get their hands on. Ashok Patel was manning the shop on his own that day and he kept a baseball bat under the counter. ‘When the boys came, he fought back,’ recalls Raj. ‘I always said if he was ever threatened, he should just hand over the cash. It’s not worth it. But he always got so angry. He said: “I’ve been working long hours, seven days a week, I’m not going to give away my money.”’ And he didn’t.Then 63, he fought the three thugs, whom the judge later declared, when they were sentenced, ‘deliberately set out to commit a robbery on a vulnerable person’. At first, Ashok was successful, pushing them out the door. Then he slipped and the three youths returned, with one stabbing him in the head, another using the baseball bat to attack him.‘The blade was this close to his brain,’ his son says, holding his thumb and finger half an inch apart. He was left in a pool of his own blood, while the three stepped over him to steal beer, milk tokens and £220 in cash.Remarkably, Old Mr Patel was back behind the counter within a month, with his arm in a sling and his head bandaged like Mr Bump. He’d gladly show his scar to any customer.‘He was a very strong man,’ says his son. He certainly was.‘He just loved working in a shop,’ adds Raj sadly. ‘He loved meeting people and being part of the community.’The number of Gujarati shopkeepers in Britain is falling markedly — mostly because their children and grandchildren have little desire for the long hours and meagre rewards. Raj’s children, Keya, 24, and Jaimini, 22, both went to Brunel University. One is now a businesswoman, the younger training to be an accountant.‘My father was very proud of them,’ says Raj. ‘I’ve asked if they want to take on the shop, but they don’t want to.’It is easy to romanticise this first generation of immigrant shopkeepers, who worked all hours to make a better life for their families. But they are as much a part of Britain’s story as the coal miners, wheelwrights and lamp-lighters of previous generations.The majority of us no longer attend a parish church or a local butcher at whose counter we can gossip, but most still have a corner shop. If you’re lucky, it will be run by someone like Mr Patel.Only when they are gone will we understand how these shops and shopkeepers have helped weave the fabric of this country together. Run by families who kept the shutters up and the lights on, rather than cause an inconvenience. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f2ed3fa2d8776d6f4e07898437b4a3d5ae661a/20_13_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c8cdfc917f1e5d9500dce78d461c02","title":"buy a classic sport photograph kelly holmes eye popping celebration","story":"The fifth of a new  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and  Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free delivery Those eyes! Having just crossed the line to win 800m gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, British athlete Kelly Holmes is pictured bursting into celebration. Part shock, part jubilation, her expression spoke volumes of her remarkable journey to success. Holmes’ career had been blighted by injuries, anaemia, asthma and depression, and her undeniable talent was frequently stymied on the greatest stage of all: at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta she competed with a stress fracture in her shin, narrowly finishing fourth in the 800m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney she overcame a calf tear to win bronze. By 2004, aged 34 and injury-free for the first time, she targeted gold in the 800m and 1,500m. In both finals she waited until the home straight before powering to the front of the field, becoming only the third woman in history to do the middle-distance double. “I can’t believe it!” she yelled repeatedly after her 800m triumph.

What a shame this revealing show smothers Paik in seriousnessThe first room says it all. By which I mean it shows you all the work by Nam June Paik you need to understand his contribution to modern art. There you will see, among other things, his masterpiece: TV Garden, an array of different-sized monitors embedded among greenery, their multicoloured screens blossoming like flowers in a gorgeous electronic pastoral.The more you think about this installation, the more insidiously provocative it is. Paik, who died in 2006 at the age of 73, was a polymath philosopher who prophesied our technological age. In 1974, he predicted the coming of an “electronic super highway” that would link everyone on Earth. Move over, Tim Berners-Lee. In 1994, when his vision was coming true, Paik celebrated it with a work called Internet Dreams, in which multiple ever-changing screens glory in information overload.Tate Modern’s retrospective of this Korean-born American visionary should be a blast of futuristic beauty, but instead it smothers Paik in seriousness. Trying to make him more than he was simply turns him into less.The power of Paik’s art lies in its lightheartedness. His message is that TV unites us and the journey to the future is sheer bliss. I treasure the memory of seeing his work Electronic Superhighway in a gallery on Canal Street in New York. This huge map of the US glowed with optimism: it seemed to perfectly reflect the city around it, from neon bar signs to the twin towers of the World Trade Center standing tall in a perfect blue sky.Paik’s gleeful beauty gets buried in this doomed attempt to turn him into a mighty modern artist on the scale of, say, Robert Rauschenberg. After that teasing glimpse of his magical way with video, you have to drag yourself through room after room, each revisiting his early career as a member of the international 1960s group Fluxus in impenetrable detail. To read every single poster, flyer and magazine – all assiduously assembled in vitrines and dwelling on long-forgotten happenings in Darmstadt – would take a lifetime. And I’ve got TV to watch.It’s not that Fluxus was boring. It’s just that you clearly had to be there. It must have been hilarious to witness Paik’s performance Etude for Piano Forte in 1960 at Atelier Mary Bauermeister, with iconoclastic composer John Cage in the audience. After playing Chopin, Paik, who trained in classical composition, produced a pair of scissors and cut off Cage’s tie.They became friends, Cage’s ideas dovetailing with the Fluxus movement. In the 1950s, far-thinking musicians and artists rediscovered the then-forgotten, but still cheekily alive, Marcel Duchamp – in particular, his belief that art could be made by chance. Cage and the Fluxus crew used random instructions, obstacles and interruptions to make art. Or sometimes they just had a laugh. Paik once connected a dildo to an old gramophone and put it in his mouth so he could feel music through his jawbone.That’s funny to read about, almost 60 years on, but hard to make sense of from the relics here. I just wish Tate Modern would curb its obsession with the extremely elusive history of Fluxus. There’s too much of it in its free collection and too much in this show.One early work, in the Paik show, is mysteriously moving in a way that exposes the ephemerality of a lot of the stuff around it. Paik’s Prepared Piano from 1962-63 is what survives of a series of instruments to which he added objects along lines inspired by Cage. Its upright wooden body is deliberately scratched and battered, its keys covered in strange stains. It is sad and pungent. It has become, over the past six decades, a great sculpture.Maybe great art has to contain something tragic. Yet Paik only let in tragedy by accident. His Prepared Piano is reminiscent of the art of another friend of his who keeps intruding memorably, and destructively, in this show. Joseph Beuys was, like Paik, a member of Fluxus – but he turned the movement’s cerebral fixations into something more expressive and a lot more melancholy.In Paik’s exhibition of prepared pianos, the audience were invited to interact: Beuys physically attacked one of them. Great, said Paik, or words to that effect. Paik would almost certainly have been nicer to know – a gregarious collaborator with an optimistic outlook. But in a room dedicated to their friendship, the Nosferatu-like Beuys steals the show. In a performance in which Beuys howls like a coyote to Paik’s piano accompaniment you can’t help fixating on the former Stuka pilot’s burn scars and inhuman grunts into the mic.Only time, decay and the sublime sustain great art like that of Beuys. The contrast is damning. In his inexhaustible belief in progress, Paik threw himself into technological experiments that simply elicit a shrug today. When, in the late 1960s, he worked at Bell Laboratories, then the most cutting-edge computer research centre around, he produced the most ambitious digital artwork anyone had yet come up with: a dot moving on a screen.Tate Modern obsessively assembles all Paik’s pioneering yet archaic experiments, including his use of magnets to distort images on 1960s TV screens by interfering with cathode-ray tubes. Anyone remember them?It’s a shame to see Paik so exposed, just through undue reverence. His finest art is completely alive and of our moment. Paik at his best revealed the wonder of our stupid world. In Bye Bye Kipling, a global broadcast originally transmitted live in 1986 with a Boston TV station, a Russian rockabilly punk band perform with Glasnost abandon while, back in the US, an alien visitor watches the proceedings to decide if humanity deserves to exist. The entire programme is addictive in the same way as TV itself. I watched it for so long, I forgot to read the Fluxus memorabilia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d54df609fd806505425143b2d260157c4490dfd1/0_9_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629ccf3bbb5dfe65ea8716398c7247c3","title":"david lachapelles lavazza 2020 calendar in pictures","story":"The photographer best known for his surreal celebrity portraits has teamed up with Lavazza to create their 2020 calendar.

John Brunton guides you to the region’s lesser-known gemsExperience urban BordeauxBordeaux has enthusiastically embraced urban regeneration, converting abandoned spaces into art, music and community projects. Kick off with the Darwin Ecosysteme, a sprawling army barracks that now houses an urban farm, artisanal brewery, skatepark, and venues for live music. Stroll along the Garonne river, marvelling at magnificent 18th-century palaces “mirrored” in the world’s largest reflecting pool, Miroir d’Eau. And from summer 2020, experience the Bassins de Lumières, exploring the immense water bunkers of an old Nazi submarine base, immersed in giant projections of Gustav Klimt’s art.Sample the local marketsThe Marché des Capucins, established in 1749, is the belly of Bordeaux and boasts locally produced caviar, charcuterie and around a hundred different cheeses. Head to Chez Jean-Mi, packed with locals jostling for a glass, while tourists vie for a table to feast on plump local oysters. Down the street, enter the vibrant square of Basilique Saint Michel, which transforms, four days a week, into a giant flea market.Tantalise your taste budsStay at concept hotel, Eklo, an inexpensive and classy take on the youth hostel, with wooden-clad bunks, private rooms, and a funky bar to have an evening apéro. Wine lovers and kids alike can embark on a sensory and interactive adventure to discover the cultures and civilisations of wine at the Cité du Vin, the swirling glass and metal wine museum stealing the Bordeaux skyline. The tour ends on the rooftop, where you can admire panoramic views of Bordeaux while sipping a glass of wine (or grape juice, if you prefer). Across from the Cité du Vin is new food market, Les Halles de Bacalan, whose vast brasserie serves a cuisine dubbed “démocrachic”: simple terroir recipes made from outstanding organic produce at affordable prices.Hang out with the localsThe cobbled backstreets of Bordeaux are a food lover’s paradise. Don’t miss Le Petit Commerce, where you can indulge in freshly caught grilled sea bream with a bottle of white Bordeaux. Prefer a wine bar crawl? Check out Vins Urbains for organic wines, and Le Bar à Vin, for everything from bubbly Crémant to Sauternes. Out of town, following the grape trail first planted by the Romans, is Château Lestrille, where winemaker Estelle Roumage runs her sustainable vineyard. She showcases her wine in chic locale, Un Château en Ville, her tasting room and restaurant in the centre of town.Hit the vineyards for a wine tourIn June 2020, the city gives itself over to the Bordeaux Wine Festival, providing a great opportunity to discover more than 80 of the region’s wines. Alternatively, head out on one of five wine routes, detailed on the official Bordeaux Wine Trip website. Drive one hour north through the Médoc peninsula, described as “the wine lover’s equivalent to Route 66”, stopping off at famous wine estate Château Mouton Rothschild, which can be visited by appointment. To the south, on the Graves and Sauternes wine route, is the Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey. Reserve a room, wander the vineyards with a guide or eat at the restaurant, Lalique.Escape to the beachIf you have a little longer, follow the locals to a nearby seaside bolthole. Surf in the white-topped waves of Lacanau, or build sandcastles on the supervised beaches at Hourtin. Visit the mammoth Dune du Pilat at Arcachon bay, Europe’s tallest sand dune the easterly wind changes its height and direction slightly every year.

On the one hand, there is a bestselling novel that has nailed a political moment, by a writer hailed as a prophet of our times. On the other, there is a verse novel capturing the hidden voices of black British women, by a writer who has honed her art for years outside the spotlight. To give the prize to Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments would put the Booker in the centre of the cultural tide. To give it to Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo would push a deserving but unsung book towards a much wider audience.That, at least, is how this year’s Booker fudge looks from the outside. Inside the judging room on Monday, all kinds of arguments and rhetoric may have been employed all kinds of views aired and argued. I have been on enough prize panels to realise how very odd these conversations can be, how you get the feeling that it all could have gone differently on another day, in another mood, let alone with another set of judges. Of course, there can be only one winner of the Booker prize. Until, that is, the very judges themselves choose to flout the regulations, as they did on Monday, and give it to two. (Confusingly, it used to be OK to split the prize, until the rules were changed after the 1992 prize was given to both Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth.)Everyone agrees that competition is the enemy of art. And yet, on the whole, there is also an agreement to conspire in the notion that it isn’t. This paradox, this doublethink, usually works fine, since it opens up the space in which the extra-artistic functions of prizes can be fulfilled. By this I mean that the people who care most about the Booker are publishers and the book trade – its effects on sales can be transformative. The Turner prize, equally, exists not because its organisers strongly believe in the objective reality of the “best” artist making work in Britain in any given year, but because it brings a huge audience to contemporary art. A case of: come for the gladiatorial combat, stay for the two-hour video installation and knotty performance art.The doublethink of prizes has worked in the past because it is, in fact, usually perfectly possible for a set of judges to arrive at a majority position that one artwork is better than a set of others. That’s what subjective, critical opinion is. The trick of a big, institutionally hefty prize is then for everyone to conspire in imagining that this does not represent some shaky provisional position, but means, objectively, that the “best” book has prevailed. A further paradox is then necessary, in which the culture on some level also admits to the impossibility of accurate measurement of artistic quality by arguing strenuously with the judges’ decision, thus making the prize a talking point among the media and wider public. These incompatible positions are part of the game, and it all makes perfect sense as long as you don’t poke the nest.The refusal of this year’s Booker judges to follow the prize’s own rules has made a gash in this delicate fabric of unspoken conventions. As well as irritating a number of people – not least the previous judges who have painfully and dutifully followed the guidelines – it is bound to dent the prize’s traditional standing, since it pushes back the Wizard of Oz’s curtain, suggesting the imperfect, flawed humanity lurking behind the award’s supposedly authoritative facade.And yet this year’s Booker decision is only a symptom of a wider phenomenon. Arts prizes are losing standing for other reasons too – the Nobel prize for literature, damaged by an infamous sexual harassment scandal and this week’s award to Peter Handke, who has denied the Srebrenica genocide, shows how quickly authority can leak away from once revered institutions.But more fundamentally, artists are rebelling against the notion of winner-takes-all prizes. There is an invisible, but I suspect growing, number of people who refuse to put themselves up for awards at all. Then there are those who have defied the prize structure by splitting their winnings – Helen Marten, for example, shared the 2016 Turner prize and the Hepworth sculpture prize with her fellow nominees. The writer Olivia Laing did the same when she won this year’s James Tait Black award. She had been writing, she said, “against an era of walls and borders, winners and losers. Art doesn’t thrive like that and I don’t think people do either. We thrive on community, solidarity and mutual support”.We will see more of this, I predict: shortlisted artists and writers getting together to repudiate the notion of a single winner. The question is whether the prizes themselves can adapt to the new mood – or whether their cultural dominance is slipping away.• Charlotte Higgins is the ’s chief culture writer.

It is time for him to goIf Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s belligerent president, were a true patriot with his country’s security and wellbeing at heart, he would resign immediately. He has made an appalling hash of things. His Syrian misadventure, while unusually calamitous, is but the latest in a long line of foreign blunders. Erdoğan abuses his position. He harms his country. He is still in office not because he is popular but because of the fear he instils and the power he crudely wields. It’s time for him to go.Having said that, doing the decent thing is not Erdoğan’s strong suit. His 16 years in power – as prime minister and then president – have been marked, at home, by growing authoritarianism and repression. The economy is an indebted mess. Corruption and nepotism thrive. After a 2016 military-led coup failed, Erdoğan exploited it to purge political opponents, the judiciary, civil society and the media. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters were jailed. Erdoğan’s creation of an executive presidency, concentrating power in his hands, was narrowly agreed in a 2017 referendum, and is proving a disaster for Turkish democracy. Effective checks and balances circumscribing his actions are lacking. Absent, too, are experienced figures, such as former prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu and ex-deputy prime minister Ali Babacan, who might have reined him in. Alienated by his domineering behaviour, they have wisely jumped ship.Turkey’s ill-considered Syrian invasion is a byproduct of Erdoğan’s dictatorial behaviour. Like Donald Trump, he trusted his gut, not seasoned advisers. Now Syrians, mostly Kurds, are paying the price. All western leaders share some blame here. They have long known Erdoğan for what he is – yet for reasons of realpolitik, they looked the other way.These leaders must now be wishing Erdoğan gone. He has made Trump look like a gullible idiot – though, admittedly, that’s not hard. But his Syrian warmaking has also deeply alarmed regional states, uniting the Arabs, Israel and Iran in angry opposition while scaring the socks off the Saudi princes. They look askance at the Erdoğan-Trump betrayal of the Kurds and rightly worry whether US security guarantees, and Nato solidarity, are mere desert mirages.Nor does the EU, scarred over the years by Erdoğan’s tantrums over Turkey’s accession, have any love for him. Perhaps Brussels believes his threat to send 3.6 million Syrian refugees to Europe. What’s certain is that it justifiably fears his Syrian invasion will boost Islamic State terrorism. His early departure would be a boon for Europe.But getting rid of Erdoğan is a matter for the Turks. And it wouldn’t be quite as difficult as it might sound. True, Erdoğan has overseen an extraordinary attack on political and civil rights, including the right to free speech and a free press. His purges have swept up senior opposition politicians, notably Selahattin Demirtaş, leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP), who came third in last year’s presidential election despite being in jail. Judges, police chiefs, lawyers and civil servants who show signs of independent thinking have been sanctioned. The current crisis has brought further crackdowns on social media. And all the while, Erdoğan pursues an often lethal vendetta against Turkey’s Kurdish minority, linking them, for self-serving purposes, to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Yet change is under way. Politically, Turkey is a ided country, split primarily between urban and rural – and since its founding in 2001, Erdoğan’s neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) has appealed to the latter constituency, to those attached to the traditional, devout way of doing things. Now, however, the mass movement of people into the cities is accelerating, the demographics are shifting, and so too are political allegiances. Istanbul, for example, has become a mega-city, home to more than 15 million people.As Erdoğan’s excesses and failures mount, loyalty to him is weakening. High-profile AKP defectors include not only Babacan and Davutoğlu, who plan new political parties, but also Abdullah Gül, Turkey’s former president and a man regarded for many years as Erdoğan’s chief crony. A new Nation Alliance of the CHP and the Good (İyi) party was launched earlier this year. And there is talk of a broader, anti-AKP front encompassing the pro-Kurdish HDP – although analysts suggest it’s a long shot.Erdoğan’s grip on power remains firm, but not as firm as it once was. The furious international backlash to his Syrian disaster, publicly exposing his fallibility, will weaken it further. If new steel and other sanctions imposed by Trump intensify entrenched economic problems, causing more hardship, price rises and job losses, and if Turkish army troops begin dying in large numbers in a Syrian quagmire, this modern-day sultan could be in terminal trouble.Turkey, when all is said and done, is a democracy, not a one-man dictatorship – a fact Erdoğan has never fully grasped. Now, the charismatic aura that once surrounded him is dissolving. The spell that enthralled the country for so long is definitively broken. Erdoğan’s political obituaries are already being penned. He should jump before he is pushed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e80aa86258ec719854a9ac7382d91b3d6d13c00/186_382_6233_3740/master/6233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=281cec379154c8aae14aaef6afcead2a","title":"the guardian view on automating poverty ok computers","story":"The use of AI and ‘welfare robots’ by governments around the world presents moral as well as technical challengesAcross the world, governments are investing in machines that they hope will run their social security systems and other services more cheaply and effectively than humans. ’s Automating Poverty series includes reports from the US, Australia and India as well as the UK. The roles played by technology in these countries are all different. But taken together, the articles reveal how automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence are extending their reach into people’s lives through the delivery of public services.As with all automation processes, speed and efficiency provide the rationale. But our reporting on systems such as those used in the US to collect government debts, and in the UK to administer social security payments, gives cause for concern on several grounds. These include practical questions such as whether the new systems work, and particularly whether they are equipped to rectify errors and false results.Given the suffering that even a single missed payment can cause to a vulnerable claimant, any glitches in such systems must be taken seriously. In the UK, there are numerous instances of universal credit (UC) payment problems linked to automation. One man ended up homeless after a computer stopped his payments on the basis of flawed data, a decision that staff appeared unable to override. In India, Motka Manjhi died after his biometric thumbprint key went unrecognised, leaving him unable to access the government food rations that he was entitled to. His family blame his death on starvation.But even were such technical hitches to be ironed out, or sufficient staff retained by government agencies so that flawed machine decisions could be routinely overriden, serious questions remain. One is whether, and in what circumstances, it is right for a government to replace employees with computers in its dealings with dependent citizens. Given that some of those who rely on the state for support because of their age or disability, or some other reason, are often to some degree marginalised or excluded, arguably what they most need from the government is not just money, but also human resources in the form of staff who can help them.This was the view taken by UC claimant Danny Brice, whose learning difficulties and dyslexia have made applying for benefits online a torment. “Talking is the way forward, not a bloody computer,” he told the . With 5 million adults who have either never used the internet or last used it more than three months ago, and millions more who are functionally illiterate, it is clear that even in a country with universal access to free secondary education there are significant barriers to any online service. This is why Labour’s recent promise to reform UC so that it is no longer “digital by default” was warmly welcomed by poverty campaigners. It is also one reason why the current government’s continued push to digitise, including the Department for Work and Pensions’ secretive “intelligent automation garage” project on checking benefit claims, should be scrutinised far more intensively.Technology is transformative, but its effects are not always beneficial. The predictive algorithms pioneered by US social media and advertising companies continue to be put to destructive as well as creative uses. Much stronger regulation is needed, for example with regard to data collected from children. Machine learning, like computers more broadly, may serve socially useful purposes, including in the design and delivery of public services. But such applications present moral and philosophical challenges as well as technical ones, among them questions of consent, privacy and the replication or even intensification of human biases.So far, this series suggests, the uses made by governments of the latest automation technologies raise more questions than they answer. The public in each of these countries needs to know much more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd24af614a8d67ae37a9739b03d0b3af29bc399/0_0_5791_3475/master/5791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705591045d8a4f9769814b416beb4346","title":"ontarios wild beauty and rugged adventure is all in the outdoors","story":"With vast and beautiful wilderness areas, and a staggering quarter of a million lakes, Ontario is the perfect place to experience outdoor relaxation and adventure“It is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw,” wrote Emily Carr, an icon of 20th-century Canadian art, whose vibrant landscape works charted the colours and shapes of the country more evocatively than any before – or since.To speak of this grandness in the raw is to speak of Ontario, the country’s most populous province. Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province’s boundaries.The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada’s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers.Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace … with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water.In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: “Life is better at the lake.”Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts.But of course there’s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer – a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the Marble Rock conservation area to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry.Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, Prince Edward County is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario. Technically an island, it juts out into the eastern corner of the lake near the head of the St Lawrence River. A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada.Sandbanks provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world’s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system. Hiking trails crisscross the park and the pristine waters are perfect for a dip in summer. But don’t be afraid to take things up a notch nearby (especially when the breeze picks up) with some kiteboarding and sailing lessons under the expert tutelage of the AirTime Kiteboarding team. Canoe and kayak rental options abound too.No matter what you’ve been getting up to, it’s not difficult to work up an appetite in the county. The best way to do so might well be by first quenching your thirst on two wheels. Cycle-and-sip tours of the island’s up-and-coming wineries are outrageously good fun. But don’t miss out on the brewery scene either (the area is renowned for its ciders), with Midtown and Parsons being the pick of the bunch.Picton, the island’s main hub is full of excellent dining and drinking options such as Hartley’s Tavern and 555 Brewing Co, but perhaps the biggest name around is the Drake Devonshire, located in the nearby waterfront town of Wellington. Billing itself as the ultra-hip country sister to its iconic downtown Toronto original, the Drake Devonshire delivers just as consistently as its urban sibling when it comes to the kitchen. Splurge and stay overnight at one of its unique rooms where every artsy detail is obsessed over. The Drake team also recently opened a more cost-conscious – but still cool – option next door with their Motor Inn.Meanwhile, the nearby Muskoka region – or as Ontarians call it, “cottage country” – is both a relaxation and outdoor adventure hub.The region is, like so many others in Ontario, famous for its lakes – and there’s no shortage of action to be had out on the water or hugging the shoreline. There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka.Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and Aerial Park. Clamber over rope bridges and obstacles in the treetop aerial adventure course, or take the zip line canopy tour crisscrossing the park for a fast and fun high-altitude thrill over seven connected zip lines. For those inclined to keep their feet a bit closer to solid ground, take a horseback trail ride with Winding Fences Farm across the beautiful open terrain in the pastures surrounding the town of Windermere.Those looking for an all-frills, all-inclusive experience will find it at the JW Marriott The Rosseau Muskoka. Not only is this luxury resort and spa considered one of Canada’s finest, but its outdoor adventure options include stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking from its exclusive lakeside beach, as well as a spectacular new 180-metre zipline that runs across the Five Bridges Trail on the resort’s grounds.Ontario’s adrenaline hotspot – the Blue Mountain resort, which not only boasts the province’s best winter sports but an amazing variety of activities the other nine months of the year – sits on the shores of another of the Great Lakes, Lake Huron. In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you’re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort’s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars.There’s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain. Located in a tranquil forest, the spa has a strict “no electronic devices” policy to ensure maximum unwind time. But when you’re basking in thermal and Nordic waterfalls, hot baths and Finnish and infrared saunas, why would you want to be thinking about the outside world anyway?While no trip to Ontario could be considered complete without at least one trek through Algonquin provincial park in search of that blessed moose, or (from a distance) bear sighting, during the summer months fun on the water takes centre stage. Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, Algonquin Outfitters offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try Parkbus, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature. Stops in Algonquin include paddlers’ paradise, Lake Opeongo and the serene Pog Lake.Of course it’s not just about the resort towns and big name outdoor destinations, there are plenty of adventures to be had throughout cottage country – with ample options to hike, get out on the water or just generally unwind. From Haliburton to Huntsville and south to Gravenhurst, there are local gems with water access for lazy morning kayaking and nearby trails for afternoon hikes. And for those who really want to get away from it all, Cabinscape offers tiny custom-made, ecologically friendly cabins perched in the wilderness of southern Ontario – and some of the options are so off-grid that they’re hike-in access only.But much like the wider province itself, it’s the far-off corners that reveal Ontario’s true character – a little rugged, a little wild, altogether unforgettable.Start planning your visit to Ontario this winter with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554f9c8e448ee31bb42c2ebaf91308d977278a6a/6_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95da73b1eec7296d154c0e18f3d1a88","title":"barbaric tests on monkeys lead to calls for closure of german lab","story":"Shocking footage shows conditions ‘clearly breach’ EU standards on animal welfare, say campaignersAn animal testing laboratory in Germany that subjected monkeys to “barbaric” treatment and kept unwell dogs in squalid conditions is under investigation amid calls for its closure.Undercover footage at the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) near Hamburg published by Cruelty Free International and Soko Tierschutz shows technicians with metal prongs grabbing macaque monkeys by the neck. The monkeys are restrained by braces during testing. The footage also shows primates being handled “violently” by technicians: in one incident a monkey has its head smacked against a door frame.Some of the monkeys appeared to be kept alone in metal cages measuring less than a cubic metre and are seen spinning in circles, indicating high levels of distress. They were reportedly forced to stand for long periods. Dogs are pictured laying in what seemed to be their own blood and faeces, with one beagle in a cage appearing to be bleeding. Staff also appeared to mishandle cats.The footage provoked an angry response from campaigners who said that suffering was clearly not being kept to a minimum, as required by law in many countries.Kate Willett, of Humane Society International, said the use of restraints was “barbaric” and described the conditions animals were kept in as “appalling”.“The technicians are treating the animals violently,” she said. “This kind of treatment is ethically insupportable and quite possibly illegal. Each country develops its own animal care guidelines, but dogs housed in these appalling conditions would not be up to the standards of the US or the UK, and it has serious ramifications for the quality of the scientific results.”Any data collected from the animals would be “virtually useless”, she said, since their physiology would be altered by the stresses they were experiencing.“It’s time for this type of testing to be relegated to the history bin,” she added. “There are new, non-animal methodologies available for safety testing so to see this type of abuse going on in in the name of science in the 21st century is unforgivable.”Since 2015, nine inspections have taken place at the facility, seven of which were unannounced. One unannounced visit took place on 8 October when evidence of the abuse was reported to authorities, and another a week later.Inspectors observed that 44 monkeys were kept “in far too small cages” and reported “long-term harm and considerable suffering”. However, the monkeys were not used in tests during the inspections.The facility was fined €300 (£260) on one occasion because it introduced new dogs without permission, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which broke the story. LPT said last Thursday that the authorities had never objected to its “animal husbandry”, according to the paper.Cruelty Free International said the conditions “clearly breach” minimum EU animal welfare requirements and called for the closure of the facility.“By failing to adopt methods that could reduce the suffering and stress experienced by the monkeys, dogs and cats, LPT are falling short of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) mandatory under EU and German legislation,” a spokesperson said.“This cannot be tolerated, and we are calling for this laboratory to be closed and a full investigation by the German authorities.”Soko, a charity campaigning for animal rights, said the footage demonstrated a “horrendous mixture of suffering and cruelty” and that the practices breached German and EU legislation.“It is unthinkable that this should be happening in a country that has animal protection in its constitution,” said Soko’s Friedrich Mülln. “We call on the German government to take immediate action to close LPT and to end these cruel and outdated poisoning tests.”In July the European commission said there were “numerous failings” in German domestic law regarding the minimisation of the number of animals used in experiments and called on the country to “correctly enact” EU directives.Cruelty Free International said the beagles at the laboratory were bred in the US and exported to Germany. They are understood to have been supplied by one of the major global suppliers of dogs. The primates were bred in China.The breeding industry that supplies laboratories around the world has faced growing scrutiny as countries have moved to ban animal testing for cosmetic products and other uses. In 2005 it was estimated that about 115m animals had been used in laboratory experiments that year. Most are killed afterwards. In the UK, there are two facilities where the typically docile beagles that are used for research are bred. They are owned by US group Marshall Bioresources.Although the use of primates and dogs in research is more carefully regulated than it used to be, they are still used regularly. More than 60,000 dogs and 70,000 primates were used in the US alone in 2016.LPT, which operates the testing facility in Mienenbüttel, near Hamburg, where the company has its headquarters, is one of the largest private laboratories in Germany and employs 175 people. On its website, it claims to work in accordance with national and international guidelines. An animal rights activist who worked there for several months earlier this year recorded the footage.The facility, which among other functions performs toxicity tests on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to measure safe doses of medication for humans, has long faced protests from animal rights activists. A demonstration is planned locally on Saturday in response to the revelations. Germany’s agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung last year that the government was committed to adapting German laws to ensure compliance with EU directives and lowering the numbers of animals used. “I want the number of experiments on animals to be continuously reduced,” Klöckner said. “Animals are fellow creatures and they deserve our sympathy.”In 2014 an undercover investigation at a neuroscience facility in Tübingen owned by the Max Planck Society revealed the “brutal” conditions in which animals were kept and spelled the end for the institute’s controversial monkey brain experiments.In response to the latest scandal, the local authority said that criminal charges had been lodged with the state prosecutor due to suspected unlawful activity.A spokesperson said: “The veterinary office responded promptly, after we were informed of the video footage, which indicates significant maladministration in the LPT facility, and carried out a comprehensive and unannounced inspection.“For this reason, the Harburg district has filed criminal charges with the prosecutor. We regret that animals have suffered as a result of noncompliant husbandry conditions and will consistently remedy all identified grievances … with all legally available means.”They added: “The challenge for the competent authorities is to examine what is and is not allowed under current legislation on animal testing and animal husbandry.” A former federal agriculture minister, Renate Künast von den Grünen, a current Bundestag member, told Süddeutsche Zeitung last Friday: “The expertise of those who carry out animal experiments is currently not sufficiently regulated.”LPT did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e980deb61d1b0bddd76cf3bfc32dc2b9b572880/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce06e242eb6787891ee4d9127fe33ba","title":"dark floral winter flower floral patterns","story":"Winter florals are glamorous but casual, womanly rather than girlish – and are an instant style updateYou probably think this is about a trend. It’s not. Floral patterns on a dark background is not so much a fashion trend as a fashion takeover. It is a look that is absolutely everywhere – so much so, that you have probably stopped noticing it. It is in my wardrobe and – as a glance around the  office confirms – in a whole lot of other wardrobes too. The formula is simple: flowers of any variety bloom against a dark-coloured background. Perhaps on a blouse, possibly a trousersuit or an evening gown, but most likely on a dress or a skirt.Without much fuss or fanfare, dark floral has lodged itself into modern life. Like the Breton stripe a decade before it, it has become style shorthand for looking current. And for looking good, but not looking as if you thought about it too much. Alessandro Michele’s super-maximalist aesthetic at Gucci has amped up the resting pulse rate of fashion, so you need a bit of print and colour for an outfit to feel really contemporary. On the other hand, the mood music of the #MeToo era doesn’t lend itself to a bunting-and-cupcakes vibe, so viewing the traditional femininity of the floral print through a darker lens feels right. And as fashion moves towards a more sustainable, less fast-moving model, a print that is a bit summery (because, flowers) and at the same time autumnal in its colours also feels right for now.Erdem Moralioglu has been making winter florals look super-chic for most of his career. For his autumn 2009 collection, he embroidered tiny, intensely coloured chrysanthemums and violets on to black dresses. Explaining how his colour scheme had taken a moody turn that season, he said at the time that the muse he had previously imagined “running free and romantic in the meadows” had now “visited nightclubs and gone home on the bus”. Ten years later, he is still into a moody bloom: this season’s Reese dress, £520, has tightly furled peonies and sprigs of cherry blossom against a black background.“I’ve always been fascinated by women and all things that imply femininity,” he says. “Flowers are an extension of that – beautiful, complex, sometimes dangerous. I like the contrast of a delicate floral print on a dark base, with little secrets hidden in the artwork. There is something wonderful about things that can be both pretty and dark at the same time.”“Glasual” – glamorous and casual – is the new smart-casual. Smart-casual looks a bit meh these days, while glasual fits the dressier, look-at-me vibe of the Instagram era. The winter floral is instantly, effortlessly glasual. It is ideal for day-to-night wear where animal print can feel a bit too much of a stretch first thing in the morning, florals have a long history as daywear. Fast-forward to cocktail hour and the moody, jewels-on-black-velvet colour combination brings just enough edge.The dark floral dress is fashion with a little “f” rather than a big one, but it is also A Bit French. It started with London-based designers – Alexander McQueen, as well as Erdem – but is now all over Paris, too. It is on the catwalk at Christian Dior and Dries Van Noten, and all over the streets of Paris. Every chic Parisienne’s current favourite haute high-street label, Sézane – tagline “French everybody can speak” – is selling a Penelope dress, £135, with tiny bright flowers on black.“Small flowers on a dark pattern is a timeless pattern,” says brand founder Morgane Sézalory. “It is not a specific trend but something that really goes through the time. During fall and winter, it is always a staple to have in your wardrobe. The print works really well on a midi or long dress with a pair of boots.”“While summer florals exude pretty femininity, there is something more edgy and dramatic about winter florals,” she says. “They are also incredibly versatile – great to style with dark separates and knitwear and more subtle than a flirty summer print. I smarten mine up with an oversized coat and boots, or dress down with some trainers and wear in the office every day.”The dark floral is Anna Wintour at Wimbledon. It is Michelle Obama at a state dinner. It is Janelle Monáe on the red carpet. It is the beauty of flowers as painted in oil by the Dutch masters, rather than in postcard watercolours. It is smart but not stuffy, womanly rather than girlish. Dark florals are not just a trend, because they show no sign of wilting. These are the flowers that never die.

The unseeded Arsenal, who are England’s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague.It has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Barça this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atlético and finished six points behind Atléti in the league.A somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozsán’s early opener, stole the show and crushed Barça.Duggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: “It’s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don’t want to just be here for the occasion. I’m really sad, that’s understandable right now but I’m sure I’ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.”Looking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera. The forward supposedly shook off that knock but did not look her usual self when out on the left wing, with the toll of a long season also undoubtedly playing its part.But a new season brings a new journey. Duggan, having scored in Barcelona’s 2-0 defeat of Atléti in front of a league record 60,739 fans last campaign, switched to the league winners this summer.A rollercoaster start to the season, however, has showed that this is not the same Atlético Madrid side that outclassed Manchester City in the round of 32 last season. In their second league game of the season, for example, they suffered a humiliating and shocking 6-1 defeat to Barcelona.A 90th-minute goal from Virginia Torrecilla ensured a 3-2 victory in Serbia against Spartak Subotica in the Champions League round of 32 first leg before a tense second game ended 1-1 to set up the meeting with City.The team are third in the league, only a point behind Barça and second-placed Deportivo de la Coruña, and it is not quite time to panic in Madrid, but with the manager José Luis Sánchez Vera departing – for personal, rather than performance-related, reasons according to the club – Atléti are going through a difficult period. The fairly unknown Pablo López, who has managed men’s teams in Segunda B and the third and fourth isions, has stepped in until the end of the season.The trip to the north west of England will be his second game in charge, having started with a 1-0 win at Levante on Saturday. The game on Wednesday could not have offered a bigger test of his nascent tenure.City are flying in all competitions. Nick Cushing’s team are unbeaten and have only conceded once in seven games. Revenge for last season’s frustrating Champions League exit, beaten 2-0 at home after drawing 1-1 in Madrid, will be on their minds too. In Duggan, though, Atlético perhaps have the key to unlocking City if they can take advantage of her knowledge of the opposition manager and pick her brains on how to handle the 11 City players that she has played with internationally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977a0143586f65fae156eed1f1dee1b757b8f035/0_174_4407_2644/master/4407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38ffe24f0c87346dd75b65da26fdb48","title":"england players stronger sofia experience gareth southgate","story":"England’s firm but dignified handling of shameful scenes in Bulgaria was character-building in the extremeJadon Sancho walked towards the tunnel of the Vasil Levski Stadium in the bitter and slightly surreal aftermath of England’s Euro 2020 qualifying win over Bulgaria – a match in which the football had seemed almost incidental. Ten yards in front of him were two of his black teammates, Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford, and a group of Bulgarian children were shouting for their shirts.Mings and Rashford had been targeted for abhorrent racial abuse from a section of the home support, with the former saying he first heard the monkey chants when he went out for the warm-up, and they kept on walking, eyes fixed on the exit door a little way away. That is when they heard the noises, yet another round of them, from the so-called grown-ups in the vicinity. It is inconceivable Sancho did not hear them.A couple of steps later, it was the turn of Sancho . “Jadon, Jadon,” the local kids yelled. They wanted his shirt. Sancho, who had come on as a 73rd-minute substitute, sized up the situation, the most jarring juxtaposition of innocence and ignorance, and made the decision. He peeled off his shirt, strolled over and handed it to one of the youngsters.It was a simple gesture, one that recognised the joy a footballer can bring to a child, but it also chimed with one of the themes of a bleak occasion from an England perspective: defiance in the face of disgusting provocation collective strength in adversity.It was a night of shame for Bulgaria, whose football union has now been charged over the racist behaviour of the country’s fans – when the right-minded majority in the wonderful city of Sofia cringed at the dunderheads. They included the journalists who tutted and scoffed during Greg Clarke’s post-match press conference, when the Football Association chairman outlined his outrage at what he had seen and heard. “Exaggeration,” one of them shouted.The counterpoint would come from Ivelin Popov, the Bulgaria captain, who had remonstrated with home fans at half-time, urging them to calm down. “I don’t want it to be like this, it’s not good for us, the federation and our country,” Popov said. “What happened was terrible. It must stop. It doesn’t matter your colour, we are all the same, we are one very big family in football. Only if we are together can we stop these bad things.”Before the game it had not been difficult to spot the group of about 50 trouble-makers. They were dressed almost entirely in black and grouped together in a well-stewarded section by one of the corner flags. They were ejected just before half-time. Why let them in at all? That said, there were pockets of the similarly unenlightened in other areas.England’s black players had heard monkey taunts on their previous visit to this stadium – for a European Championship qualifier in 2011 – and the punishment from Uefa was a £34,230 fine. Those sort of measures simply have not worked and nor, on Monday’s evidence, have partial stadium closures. The stadium had 5,000 seats cordoned off for England’s visit because of the actions of their supporters in the June qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo.Gareth Southgate had noted in the aftermath of last Friday’s shock defeat against the Czechs in Prague that his squad faced “an interesting few days because we have not had a result or a performance like that”. Many of the younger players had not experienced the backlash which always accompanies an England misstep. It is ferocious and the first idea, according to Southgate, had been to “repair the confidence of the whole group”. That was hard enough.In addition, the manager and the squad had to prepare for the possibility of racial abuse because it had happened to them in Montenegro last March. Back then they had not been properly briefed they were not abreast of Uefa’s protocols. This time they were and it meant carrying further emotional baggage.The weight on Southgate has been immense and the one-time rather reluctant accepter of the England manager’s job has added a fresh layer to his responsibilities he has become one of the country’s most high-profile ambassadors. “The job is a remarkable one in terms of the breadth of what you have to deal with,” he said. “I can’t think of too much that’s like it. We’ve had to go through an incredible amount in 72 hours – football, non-football, everything else.”As usual, his delivery has been note perfect. He did not want to get into what he thought Uefa ought to do in order to combat racism more effectively but he did accept it had to try something different. “It was as big an operation as there has been in Sofia and the sad reality is that we weren’t able to stop incidents happening,” Southgate said. “Something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step.”Southgate admitted that with 10 minutes of the first half to play and the monkey chants continuing despite an appeal over the PA for them to stop, he was “not confident we would be finishing the game”. There would be two stoppages in play, as England drew attention to the racism but no walk-off, no abandonment. Southgate and his players made their statements by staying on and through the quality of their football and their dignity.“The players’ response, their focus, the way they played though the stoppages and back into it, were remarkable,” Southgate said. “Bizarrely, I think they’ve gained strength from the experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b793ac86b8563ea512c9975d0b36a65ee4ac88ec/0_10_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c79392fe26307caa75385f9db7371fdf","title":"expel teams from tournaments over racism urges kick it out chief bulgaria england","story":"Boris Johnson has joined demands by anti-racism campaigners for Uefa to take strong action after the racist chanting that marred England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria on Monday night.European football’s governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for racist behaviour of its supporters after the incidents at the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia, in which some home fans made monkey noises at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford in the 6-0 victory for Gareth Southgate’s side.The BFU was also charged over Nazi salutes by fans and the throwing of objects from the stands, while they and the English Football Association (FA) were both charged over the disruption of national anthems. The FA also faces a separate charge of having insufficient travelling stewards.The match was halted twice during the first half under Uefa’s anti-racism protocols after Mings and Southgate alerted officials about the abuse, with television pictures at half-time also showing several fans using Nazi salutes. Their actions were condemned by the anti-­discrimination groups Kick It Out and Fare, while the FA chairman, Greg Clarke – who is also vice-president of Uefa – called for the authorities to now show “zero tolerance”. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has ­written to the Uefa president, Aleksander Čeferin, offering support and asking him to take “urgent action” after the prime minister’s spokesman said the incidents were a “stain on football”.“The England players and management showed tremendous dignity and the prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this ­despicable abuse for their response,” he added. “We support the FA’s calls for an urgent investigation with tough penalties to follow.”A section of the stadium was closed for Monday’s game after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria’s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June.The punishment will also apply in the home game against the Czech Republic next month. The next step would be to implement a full stadium closure, as was the case with Montenegro after England’s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March, although Uefa’s disciplinary panel is allowed to go much further and has the power to expel a country from a tournament.However, Bulgaria is expected to argue that those responsible for the problems were in the minority and dealt with by stadium stewards.A group of about 50 people, who are understood to have been members of club side Lokomotiv Plov’s “ultras” group Lauta Army, were asked to leave at half-time. Čeferin has defended Uefa’s punishments for racism as “among the toughest in sport” and called on for a “war” on ­discrimination but added that it would require the help of governments and the whole “football family” to tackle the problem.“Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,” he said. “We cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve.“More broadly, the football family– everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans – needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to ­marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.” He added: “Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments to0 need to do more.”But Kick It Out demanded that Uefa should consider a points ­deduction or tournament expulsion. “The fines from Uefa we don’t think are enough,” chief executive, Roisin Wood, said on the Today programme. “There have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter ­tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are ­professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should ­professional players get it in theirs?”Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, the world game’s governing body, said he wanted “all football governing ­bodies to join us and think together of new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football”.He added: “As a starting point, I ­suggest that all competition organisers enact regulations which envisage life bans from stadiums for those who are found guilty of racist behaviour at a football match. Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.”Borislav Mihaylov, the BFU’s president, has resigned after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, demanded that he stepped down following his comments before the match last week. The former Reading goalkeeper had urged Uefa to take action against ­England after the Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, said ­Southgate’s side would walk off the pitch if they heard racist chanting.That reaction was applauded by the Manchester City and England forward Sterling, who was also on the receiving end of racist abuse in Montenegro. “A good move credits to you M. Borissov,” Sterling wrote on Twitter. But the Bulgaria goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, saw it differently after the match, claiming the home supporters had “behaved well” and that England’s players had “overreacted a bit”.Yet the Aston Villa defender Mings, who was making his first international appearance on Monday, admitted he had spoken out because he felt a duty to report the abuse.“It didn’t affect my feelings,” he said. “I think I’m quite lucky in that way because I don’t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don’t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09535a5849a60941ed8512a0e412e52b1cdd368/264_83_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f028253c65572ccb0bb9534930bfb7d2","title":"buy a classic david squires cartoon from our collection","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at 25 of his favourite strips from down the years, all of which are now available at our  Print Shop, a link to each can be found by clicking on the title of each caption below"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b06f6357c0e3e2a47aa62627755037d1475e00/0_0_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b01c15da153d58dfcfc9ba780e909","title":"what is the truth about vaping","story":"Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

She has said it was an accident, and that she is sorry.She initially cooperated with police before being flown out of the country. The US said at the time she would not be returned to the UK as she was covered by diplomatic immunity.It was not immediately clear whether the Dunn family were going to meet the US president, Donald Trump, a known fan of morning TV shows, or whether the meeting would be with officials.Speaking ahead of their meeting in the White House, the parents said: “We are grateful for the invitation, which we hope represents a positive development in our fight for justice. Our priority, as any parent will understand, is justice for our child. We believe this can only be achieved if Anne Sacoolas returns to England and engages properly with the justice system, where she will be treated fairly in a proper investigation of what happened to our son on that day – an investigation that cannot happen without her cooperation.“Friends tell each other the truth. If Britain and America are friends then we believe there should be no possibility of a citizen of one country hiding from justice in another while falsely claiming a privilege such as diplomatic immunity.” Earlier, lawyers acting for the parents demanded to see all the exchanges between the US embassy, the UK Foreign Office and the British police that led to Sacoolas claiming diplomatic immunity and leaving the country.The lawyers say they will mount a judicial review if the Foreign Office does not cooperate. The department wrote to the Dunn family at the weekend to say that the US and the UK agreed that Sacoolas’s diplomatic immunity no longer applied once she returned to the US.The family are being advised by two leading lawyers specialising in diplomatic immunity, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robinson.“What we don’t know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede.” It remains unclear why the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, did not tell the Dunn family when he met them last week that he believed Sacoolas lost her immunity once she returned to the US. In what has been described as a cold meeting, the Dunn family were left with the impression that the Foreign Office could do no more.Raab has said he needed to be sure of the legal position before he confided in the family.Stephens contends that Sacoolas’s husband, Jonathan Sacoolas, may not have had diplomatic immunity, but the Foreign Office says all staff at RAF Croughton, where he worked, were covered by immunity.Sacoolas has said she wants to meet the family to apologise and take responsibility, but has not said she will return to the UK. Her lawyers said: “Anne stayed on the scene of the ­accident to assist. She spoke to Harry to tell him that she would call for help. She waved down another car. That driver offered to assist Harry so that Anne could comfort her young children in her car.”Sacoolas claimed she left the scene only when an ­ambulance arrived.Charles said at a press conference in New York that the family had been told there was CCTV evidence showing Sacoolas leaving the RAF base “on the wrong side of the road”.She added: “CCTV follows her all the way down the road on the wrong side of the road and you see Harry’s headlight of his motorbike and then there is a big fireball when his bike went up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa64058714aa143c20f854a4815c6cc895c890f1/585_401_4983_2990/master/4983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a016fc551fef741fa89c6ae4d80692fa","title":"lib dems in renewed push for second brexit referendum vote","story":"Public should have final say on any deal PM brings back from EU summit, Lib Dems argueThe Liberal Democrats will try to push MPs to a fresh vote on a second Brexit referendum next week.The party has tabled an amendment to the Queen’s speech requesting that any deal brought back from Brussels by the prime minister is put to another public vote.The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said: “The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of remain and have been the leading voice in the People’s Vote campaign.“Boris Johnson is determined to have a general election, but the best way to resolve the Brexit chaos is to have a people’s vote and give the British people the final say about their future.“The best deal we have is as members of the European Union and we want to give the people the chance to choose to stop Brexit.”Johnson’s legislative agenda was set out on Monday during the state opening of parliament. MPs are now in the midst of five days to debate on the Queen’s speech – which contained 26 bills – and will vote on whether to pass it early next week, possibly Tuesday.With no majority and the expectation that Labour and the SNP will vote it down, the government is likely to struggle to get it through parliament.The amendment brought by the Lib Dems if selected by the Speaker could be a significant moment in the Commons as it is another chance to show whether there is a majority for a second referendum. Another referendum on Brexit was rejected during indicative votes held in April.The Lib Dems have said they back another vote on EU membership but, should they win a majority of seats at a general election, they would immediately revoke the government’s decision to trigger article 50 and the UK would remain in the bloc.They have weathered significant criticism amid claims the party’s position is undemocratic. However, Swinson has stated that revoking article 50 is the right course of action because a no-deal Brexit would be like “burning your house down”.MPs who support a second Brexit referendum believe they are nearing a majority, but they remain apprehensive as it would involve winning over many of about 40 Labour MPs who either opposed or abstained on the issue at the last parliamentary vote.Ruth Smeeth was one of four MPs from heavily leave-backing constituencies who defied the Labour whip in order to back a second referendum during the last vote. She quit her frontbench role, working for the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, saying that Britain “needed to leave, and leave with a deal”. Smeeth argued that her position was what was best for her constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North.On the last numbers, around 330 MPs were against a second referendum, with 292 in favour. However, pressure has been put on Labour MPs to change their positions in light of the party’s clear policy in favour of a referendum on a Labour-negotiated deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758025ea847bcf3104e0940023ebcaeca02c8fc1/0_261_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71d986ac3d6dd3408cb3b9e4c8a0aad","title":"michel barnier midnight ultimatum uk what happens now","story":"After a series of U-turns, there are signs a deal is possible. We look at the potential outcomesBy Wednesday afternoon, it will be clear whether Boris Johnson will have a deal to put to parliament on its “super Saturday” sitting or not. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, will inform members whether the prime minister has conceded enough on the Irish border for there to be a draft treaty to present to leaders when they hold a summit on Thursday.The prime minister has made a series of major U-turns in recent weeks. That has given EU officials some hope he will continue in this vein. A final push has been demanded by Barnier and EU sources are confident Downing Street will deliver. There are nerves in Berlin and Paris at the pace of developments but the European commission is keen to get a deal done.Barnier has said the UK needs to table a legal text, and it needs to be based on the February 2018 Northern Ireland-only backstop. That proposal – rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage that no British prime minister could accept – would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods and the EU’s customs territory. The arrangement would cease to be in force if a future trade deal offered an alternative solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Barnier is open to tweaking that model, however. A consent mechanism, under which Stormont has a say over alignment with the EU, could ensure that both nationalist and unionist communities give their approval for continued alignment with the EU. On the tentative deal on customs, Northern Ireland could de jure remain in the UK’s customs territory rather than the EU’s. But Northern Ireland would de facto remain under the EU’s full customs code. It would in practice be a thick border in the Irish Sea.Yes. A similar deal was killed off by the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexiter European Research Group MPs in 2018. But both seem to be giving Johnson more leeway than they afforded May. Any arrangement that creates checks and controls, and potentially a tariff border between Britain and Northern Ireland, is problematic. But the UK would establish a rebate system to ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are not financially disadvantaged. They could also arguably claim that the UK, “whole and entire”, would leave the EU’s customs territory.There are two possibilities: deadlock if Johnson decides to attack Brussels for intransigence, or further negotiations to talk around the problem next week. The latter would open up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, for a potential deal to be signed off by leaders. A Brexit extension beyond 31 October is inevitable either way.For all the noise from Downing Street, Johnson has been a pliant negotiator with Brussels in recent days. There is some evidence that he now wants to put a deal to parliament on 19 October, come what may. If the last three years of Brexit have taught us anything it is that fudge, delay and prevarication are always the most likely course. But EU sources are confident a deal is there to be had this week given the UK’s sudden flexibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4165790f6c97a1817ecf2a1d1ffb894a50d7c37f/0_17_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d562d9f9c68191ffa0162599c6e9fc8c","title":"nicola sturgeon to demand powers for 2020 referendum","story":"SNP leader tells conference she will ask Westminster to transfer powers by end of yearNicola Sturgeon has urged Scotland to “reclaim its independence”, confirming in an upbeat party conference address that she intends to hold a second independence referendum in 2020 and will demand that the Westminster government transfer the powers to do so by the end of this year.But Scotland’s first minister did not offer a practical alternative route to a referendum should the request for a section 30 order, which transfers the requisite legal power to Holyrood, be rebuffed.The SNP leader told the packed conference hall in Aberdeen that a Westminster refusal was not sustainable. “The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties: what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future?”“We can already see the cracks appearing. The Labour leaderships in London and Wales have recognised our right to choose … Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum.” Downing Street used Monday’s Queen’s speech to double down on Boris Johnson’s previous insistence that the 2014 independence referendum was “once-in-a-generation”, while the Labour leadership has most recently insisted there should be no electoral pact or deal with the SNP, and that a referendum should not happen within the “formative years” of a Labour administration.Telling delegates that the party already had “a cast iron mandate for an independence referendum”, Sturgeon reiterated the importance of holding a vote that is legal and internationally recognised.On the first day of conference, an expected rebellion over a proposed “plan B” – the option of demanding independence without a legally-constituted referendum – was swiftly quashed by an overwhelming majority of delegates.In what was a mainly relaxed and humorous address, which quoted Billy Connolly and Robert Burns, Sturgeon took the opportunity to warn delegates about the conduct of a coming independence campaign.She said: “We will win our independence. But not the Brexit way. Not by undermining democracy, demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading. So let us resolve today that how we campaign for independence will always reflect the open, tolerant, inclusive and democratic nation we are determined to build.”Announcing a raft of domestic policies and potential manifesto commitments, including giving police the power to remove abusers from the family home, scrapping all non-residential social care charges and expanding free childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds, Sturgeon said that a general election “cannot come soon enough”.“When it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous. Vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland’s right to choose.”Guaranteeing that, in the event of a hung parliament, the SNP will never put the Tories into power, she added: “I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support. If you don’t respect Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone.”Describing Brexit as a disaster, she railed against the unfairness of a potentially differentiated deal for Northern Ireland, saying: “Wales will have voted to leave. England will have voted to leave. Northern Ireland will be given a say over its future. Scotland will be the only country in the UK to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe. That is not a partnership of equals. That is a denial of fairness and basic democracy.”Accusing successive Westminster governments of having “shattered the case for the union”, she told delegates that it was “time to complete that home rule journey” as she painted a picture of an independent Scotland free of Trident nuclear weapons, with a written constitution and leading globally on climate change. The Scottish Greens accused the SNP of hypocrisy earlier in the week for accepting sponsorship from Heathrow and BP at the conference.Sturgeon told cheering delegates: “It is time to reclaim our independence.””I don’t know about you but I’m utterly sick of Westminster. I’m sick of Brexit. And I’ve had more than enough of people like Jacob Rees-Mogg lording it over us while lounging across the benches of the House of Commons as if he owns the place. The people of Scotland are seeing all of this for what it is. A broken political system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890b9b802f45cf0227a5f36753a70fdd68852e76/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d019ef4c0a3a72a1eda3e44963bf68c","title":"rees moggs dim brand banter entertains no one but himself","story":"Leader of the house’s unctuous insincerity fails to hide the fact he hasn’t a clue what’s going onCrack open the English sparkling wine. Boris Johnson has just won his first Commons vote. OK, it was only a statutory instrument to carry over EU air quality legislation to the UK after Brexit – the parliamentary equivalent of a second round victory in the Johnstone’s Paints Trophy – but these days the prime minister has learned he gets what he can get. Much more of this and he might even get an expression of confidence from the club chairman.That, though, was the high point of yet another day in which the government struggled to convince even itself that it knew what it was doing. It began with Jacob Rees-Mogg giving a short business statement, the sole point of which was to avoid saying that he didn’t have a clue what was going on so he couldn’t tell MPs whether they would need to be sitting on Saturday or not.Since joining the cabinet, lying has become second nature to the leader of the house. Power has corrupted him and what integrity he might once have had is now shot. Everyone knew that Saturday’s possible emergency session was entirely dependent on whether Johnson agreed to desperately negotiate himself back to a permanent Northern Ireland backstop with a customs border in the Irish Sea – the prime minister is one of the few people who could haggle the price up in a carpet shop – to give himself a deal on which the Commons could vote and save him the embarrassment of having to “die in a ditch” by writing an extension letter to the EU.But time and again Rees-Mogg argued otherwise. “Oh, no, no, no, no,” he said, chuckling to himself while oozing unctuous insincerity. “The honourable member had referred to ‘running a bath’ when surely he meant ‘drawing a bath’.” Weirdly, Rees-Mogg labours under the impression that this kind of bantz is clever. One can only imagine he rewatches his greatest hits on the BBC’s Parliament channel alone at night in a state of mild sexual arousal. Whatever gets you off.Saturday had nothing whatsoever to do with Johnson’s ability to agree to whatever the EU demanded, Rees-Mogg continued. The issue was that the Incredible Sulk was such a tough negotiator – “You’re welcome to keep Liverpool in a customs union as well if you like. I’ve never liked the whinging scousers and they’ve certainly never voted Tory. And while you’re about it you might as well help yourself to Scotland as well. After all, it’s only a matter of time” – that there might need to be a vote on the prime minister being forced to write to the EU.Er, you do know there is nothing in the Benn act about there needing to be a vote, Chris Leslie and Anna Soubry pointed out. Johnson could just knock out the “Dear EU” letter in between letting the dog out and spilling wine all over the sofa. But there is a need for a vote, Rees-Mogg persisted. There really isn’t. Not even his own backbenchers could bring themselves to offer him any support. One day, long after the thrill has gone, he might look back on this afternoon with embarrassment. It’s one thing to be thought dim. Another to prove it.Alok Sharma is one of the nicer Tory MPs, but even he must be surprised to find himself secretary of state for international development, as his entire career has been based on not doing anything to draw attention to himself. Neither clever nor stupid – the two usual qualifications for membership of the cabinet – just thoroughly unmemorably average. He must also have been horrified to find that Dominic Raab had done a runner and that he was now expected to open the Queen’s speech debate on foreign affairs.Um, I haven’t really got anything to say, he shrugged to a near empty chamber. The sheer futility of a government with a majority of minus 45 delivering a Queen’s speech is getting to almost everyone. Britain is the greatest country in the world. Which is why we wanted to leave the EU because Johnny Foreigner was just holding us back.And we’d also like to help some of the poorer countries, but frankly why should we? It would only encourage them to become more dependent on us. And yes it was true we were £60bn worse off as a result of voting to leave the EU but that was the kind of decision only the best country in the world could take. The only moment of honesty in his entire speech was when Emily Thornberry shouted “bollocks”. This wasn’t Sharma’s finest hour. Not that anyone could remember if he had ever had one. Maybe next time.Keir Starmer was assured in reply. Of the seven Brexit bills the government was planning to introduce, five were ones it had failed to implement in the last parliament and one had been withheld because it would never have passed. He swatted aside several Tory interruptions – it’s amazing how often it’s the MPs who understand a subject the least feel most inclined to speak about it – and repeatedly invited Sharma to say whether the government intended to crash out without a deal on 31 October regardless of whether there was a deal to be had. Sharma let out a quiet sob. This was massively above his pay grade. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be99cdf416a619a80d785b9f14a0e80c9c84651/5_0_3490_2094/master/3490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196214b1e5b29e9970b1a6329d3922c0","title":"uk to accelerate plans for decarbonisation of transport sector","story":"Government vows to unveil climate roadmap next year but critics demand action not more policies and plansThe UK government has vowed to accelerate its climate action for transport sector by drafting new plans to end emissions from trains, planes and cars by 2050.Ministers promised to begin the groundwork on the government’s first detailed plan to decarbonise the transport sector immediately, and unveil the plan in full next year.The climate action roadmap will be one of many new government climate proposals expected in 2020 to help meet the UK’s legally binding target to build a carbon neutral economy by 2050.The plans follow a damning rebuke from the UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) earlier this year, in which John Gummer, the committee chair, likened the government’s climate efforts to the TV comedy Dad’s Army.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “We want to work with industry and communities around the country to develop this plan – to make our towns and cities better places to live, help to create new jobs, improve air quality and our health, and take urgent action on climate change.”Shapps was speaking on the same day that environmental protesters targeted the Department for Transport offices over its support for the HS2 rail project, which is expected to run through ancient woodlands.The transport climate roadmap is expected to bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 after Shapps told the Conservative party conference this month that the government would “thoroughly explore the case” for a 2035 deadline.The government also hopes to unleash a large-scale battery boom by cutting red tape in the planning system for energy storage projects larger than 50MW. This should help energy companies build bigger batteries faster, and at lower costs, to make help use more of the UK’s renewable electricity projects.Under separate plans the government has proposed setting out tougher minimum energy efficiency standards for rented workplaces which could put British businesses in line for savings of around £1bn a year on energy bills.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said the government would build on Britain’s track record on climate action, and “will keep on going further and faster to ensure our action meets our ambition”.The ambition was broadly welcomed by industry, but many warned that the UK needs to take action rather than rely on proposals and plans.The campaign group Transport and Environment said the plan to accelerate the transport sector’s climate agenda does not go far enough. The group said ministers should have announced a 2030 ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles, an end to the fuel duty freeze and new taxes on aviation.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said: “When it comes to preparing for the effects of climate change, the government’s approach continues to rest on the need for further research and guidance, instead of action. Meanwhile, the country remains unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature.“The UK’s role as a genuine climate leader now rests on tangible commitments – we will be watching next month’s budget closely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d762e7d7adbefcfd7c747b1fd50a91e91932d91/0_0_6442_3866/master/6442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6cac54b97e1fa53c085f7fce11433ed","title":"testosterone boosts womens athletic performance study shows","story":"Research confirms increase in endurance as IAAF imposes upper limit on trans female athletes Boosting testosterone levels significantly improves female athletic performance, according to one of the first randomised controlled trials.The findings come as the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) announced on Monday it would impose an upper limit for testosterone levels on trans female athletes competing in middle-distance events.Testosterone was assumed to be performance-enhancing and a factor in explaining differences in strength and endurance between men and women. However, there was a surprising lack of evidence on the impact of testosterone in women and the question had become mired in controversy following a series of rulings in professional sport.The latest research confirmed that testosterone significantly increases endurance and lean muscle mass among young women, even when given for a relatively short period.Prof Chris Cooper, emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Essex, who was not involved in the work, said: “The data is really clear. This adds further evidence that if you give testosterone to female athletes. you improve their performance. Some people have suggested that testosterone is not the only sex difference, but it’s clearly the best indicator.”Cooper added that, despite growing interest in the issue, the challenge in gaining ethics approval to give healthy women testosterone had resulted in a lack of empirical studies.The IAAF ruled this week that trans female athletes must keep their levels of natural testosterone below 5 nanomoles per litre of blood to compete in the female category. The new regulation follows a similar limit imposed on athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD), including the South African Olympic gold medallist, Caster Semenya.Semenya is challenging the IAAF’s new rules that athletes with DSD must take testosterone-reducing medication to compete in track events from 400m to the mile or change to another distance.The athlete argued that the rules were discriminatory and unfair. In May, she said: “For a decade the IAAF has tried to slow me down, but this has actually made me stronger.”The Court of Arbitration for Sport in May found that the rules for athletes with DSD were discriminatory, but that the discrimination was “necessary, reasonable and proportionate” to protect “the integrity of female athletics”.Critics of the limit have argued that testosterone is not the dominant factor in giving men a performance advantage in certain sports. In the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, 48 healthy 18- to 35-year-old women were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of daily treatment with 10mg of testosterone cream or 10mg of a placebo.The scientists tested the hormone’s impact on aerobic performance measured by how long the women could run on a treadmill before reaching the point of exhaustion, and leg power, muscle strength and lean muscle mass.Circulating levels of testosterone rose from 0.9 nmollitre of blood to 4.3 nmolL in the women given the hormone cream. This was below the recent 5 nmolL IAAF limit and below the normal male range of 8-29 nmolL.Cooper said that the latest findings left little doubt that testosterone was generally performance enhancing for female athletes. He added that the question of whether testosterone cutoffs should be applied and to whom was not a purely scientific one, however. “It’s a political, social decision about who you want to be competing and at what level,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05184bcda21127d611feb5254b14390e827f9812/0_25_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071ce96fc2d364e96fe5907e1622b3df","title":"2019 earth science week photo competition winners","story":"The Geological Society has announced the winners of this year’s competition, which for the first time allowed in images taken from around the world.

Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

But concerns have been raised about privacy and data security, the ability of council officials to understand how some of the systems work, and the difficulty for citizens in challenging automated decisions.It has emerged North Tyneside council has dropped TransUnion, whose system it used to check housing and council tax benefit claims. Welfare payments to an unknown number of people were wrongly delayed when the computer’s “predictive analytics” erroneously identified low-risk claims as high risk.Meanwhile, Hackney council in east London has dropped Xantura, another company, from a project to predict child abuse and intervene before it happens, saying it did not deliver the expected benefits. And Sunderland city council has not renewed a £4.5m data analytics contract for an “intelligence hub” provided by Palantir.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “Good use of data can be hugely beneficial in helping councils make services more targeted and effective … But it is important to note that data is only ever used to inform decisions and not make decisions for councils.”But Silkie Carlo, the director of the campaign group Big Brother Watch, said the increasing use of algorithms was leaving vulnerable people at the whim of “automated decisions … they have no idea about and can’t challenge”.Gwilym Morris, a management consultant who works with IT providers to the public sector, said the complexity of the systems meant the leadership of local authorities “don’t really understand what is going on” and this raised questions about how citizens’ data was used.A council report concluded: “TransUnion provides no reason for a case meeting a high-risk category and it was found that in most cases, the reason for it being high risk could not be established … There was no reason for the payment to be withheld, but claims had been delayed.”A spokesperson for TransUnion said the classification of risk groups was “ultimately a matter for the local authorities to decide”.They added: “Each local authority also determines what extra checks are required for claimants falling into any particular category, and can monitor for accuracy so that they can adapt their criteria if necessary.“The time spent on reviewing ‘high-risk’ claims will equally depend on each local authority’s own policy in terms of processing the additional checks.”TransUnion said it checked benefit claims for fraud for about 70 local authorities in the UK, and Xantura serves the same number of councils. The combined figure does not include other examples of algorithms found by the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University.Sunderland council awarded a contract for a new “intelligence hub” to Palantir in 2014 as part of a plan to make efficiency savings. Last year, it was announced the authority faces a budget gap of about £50m over the next three years.The hub was used to analyse data to help with the Troubled Families programme, to bring together information on those at risk of sexual exploitation, and to help find areas at risk of flooding. The council said it did not hold a review of the project and did not know how much had been saved.A council spokesperson said it was always the authority’s intention not to renew the contract and Palantir had worked alongside staff to transfer knowledge so the council would become “self-sufficient”.Hackney council said “issues of variable data quality meant that the system wasn’t able to provide sufficiently useful insights”.The Xantura predictive model analyses warning signs about a household, such as a child being expelled from school or a report of domestic violence. The model’s prediction is then passed to a social worker for potential action.Wajid Shafiq, the chief executive of Xantura, said: “We’re improving the accuracy of our analytics and models continuously but we have never been unable to develop a reliable predictive model.“There are a number in place right now, adding real value. Not being able to access regular updates of source data to drive the model is a bigger issue – if we don’t get regular feeds, we can’t provide an up-to-date picture of risk factors.”Simon Burall, a senior associate with the public participation charity Involve, said: “There are never just benefits from these things but risks and harms, namely privacy and data security.“But also potential wider unintended consequences, including the stigmatisation of communities and unwanted intrusion by particular services. Any benefits must be balanced against those potential risks.”David Spiegelhalter, a former president of the Royal Statistical Society, said: “There is too much hype and mystery surrounding machine learning and algorithms. I feel that councils should demand trustworthy and transparent explanations of how any system works, why it comes to specific conclusions about iniduals, whether it is fair, and whether it will actually help in practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2574ccbc1ab63379eec6e69102491373890c70a2/166_0_3993_2395/master/3993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f4e517cfd86ad6ede56e0f2bcff2171","title":"frankie dettori enable horse racing arc","story":"Frankie Dettori is “absolutely buzzing” following the surprise announcement that Enable is to race on next year at the age of six, a reaction that will be widely shared among racing fans.The veteran mare, whose winning run came to an end in Paris last week, had already been ruled out of Champions Day this weekend and followers of the sport had begun to reconcile themselves to the likelihood she had run her last race and would now be packed off to her owner’s stud in Newmarket.Instead she will be kept in training with John Gosden. “Enable has come out of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in good form and will not race again this year,” said the owner’s racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe.“Her programme will be determined entirely on her wellbeing, so no racing plans will be announced at this stage. The Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe remains an important target.”Rain-softened ground robbed Enable of the chance to win a third consecutive Arc, as she was overhauled by the stout stayer Waldgeist in the closing stages. But she may yet become the first horse to win Europe’s most prestigious Flat race for a third time and bookmakers installed her as the 7-1 favourite for next year’s contest, when the Arc will be 100-years-old.Ascot’s King George at the end of July will also be a key target. Enable shares with Dahlia and Swain the distinction of being the only horses to have won that race twice and she could be the first to make it three.A seemingly emotional Dettori was reported as saying: “She is the world’s favourite horse. To have one more year with my special girl is amazing. I can’t wait to sit back on her again on the racetrack next year. I’m absolutely buzzing about this.“To me she has been the horse of a lifetime and to have one more year is wonderful.

Look out of the hotel window and there is so much rising steam it suddenly becomes easier to understand why the tournament organisers chose unflashy Oita to stage two of this weekend’s four quarter-finals.Because this week is all about staying relaxed under pressure: who will respond best and not blow their tops as the tension mounts? Given only four of England’s squad – Ben Youngs, Manu Tuilagi, Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes – have experienced a World Cup knockout game, it is an area Australia will hope to examine given the way their opponents imploded during the 2015 pool stages.It is a fair enough target. As Japan have shown so wondrously against Ireland and Scotland, the side who can release themselves from the shackles of self-doubt and express themselves become infinitely more dangerous. If there is a greater threat to England’s aspirations than the Wallabies, it is fear itself. They are a good team but, under intense pressure, they have not always responded as positively as they might have liked.Joe Marler, their fit-again prop forward, was interesting on the subject on Tuesday. As one of the squad’s more senior players, he was around when England travelled to Cardiff in 2013 in pursuit of a Six Nations grand slam that never materialised. “I was involved in the 2013 England team and I remember the feeling among the group being really nervous. We were so close, we just had to win this game. Other teams I’ve been involved in have let nerves overcome them and caved in, allowing the nerves to become negative.”And now? According to Marler that 30-3 Millennium Stadium drubbing is ancient history, as is the tension-racked 2015 World Cup which he described only last month as a “crap” experience. “I don’t feel that in this group. You may turn to me on Sunday and say: ‘You ballsed that up, Joe’ if we end up losing but I don’t feel that. I feel the boys embrace that nervousness and use it as positive energy to drive us on. We have a bring-it-on mentality.”It is Marler’s belief, too, that England’s sizeable Saracens contingent, all accustomed to winning domestic and European club trophies, make up for any shortfall at Test level. “On paper there are only four boys who have been in a World Cup quarter-final before but the Saracens boys have been in big games consistently over the past four or five years. They’re big leaders in this team, huge cogs, and I think we’ve got enough in us to be able to cope with the challenge that presents itself on Saturday.”In Marler’s case, reversing his decision to retire from international rugby and making himself available for this World Cup has also clearly given him a fresh sense of perspective. He looks and sounds like a man who now views this weekend as a fabulous opportunity, having “worked my buns off” to show the management he remains hungry to succeed at the top level and, in the nick of time, resumed full training having been ruled out of last week’s cancelled France fixture.His time out of the England picture has also taught him that what works as a motivational tool for some does not necessarily suit everyone. “Each inidual is different. Jonny Wilkinson used to speak about the thing that drove him most was the fear of failure and that worked brilliantly for him. He was one of the best ever to play the game.Two more wins and he and his teammates will have a clear shot at matching the legends of 2003. Marler jokes that the next three weekends could make a big difference to this England side’s profile – “I’m sure a lot of ’03 boys will then be looking over their shoulders thinking: ‘Oh God, we’re going to be struggling for after-dinner gigs now’” – but finding the right mindset to tackle Australia is all that currently matters. Amid the steaming onsens of Oita, England feel they are coming nicely to the boil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e8885b1f3ceba389200c9a4e7097a9b68d1fbc/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbc12ad20b5ad0d5de8bcaab8055c77","title":"mountain climbers 2020 tour de france toughest chris froome","story":"Route described as ‘the toughest’ by Chris Froome as race organisers plan to use all the mountain ranges and include only one time trialThe Tour de France’s search for novelty and excitement in recent years has taken it in one direction: hillier, shorter, more intense, with occasional ventures off the Tarmac. The 2020 route heads down that road at breakneck speed, with only one time trial – and that up a severe climb – only one stage over 200 kilometres, and so many climbs that they risk becoming interchangeable, a blur of constant action.“The toughest Tour I’ve ever seen,” said Chris Froome, who hopes to return from a severe crash to try for his fifth title, as long as his teammate Egan Bernal does not snatch the leadership of Ineos from him. The toughness comes not so much in the actual volume of climbing – there are relatively few classic set-piece ascents in the Alps and Pyrenees, no Mont Ventoux, no Alpe d’Huez – but in the constant day-to-day intensity that will make it virtually impossible for the race to settle down. “It’s more a mid-mountain all‑rounder route. I don’t think that makes it more difficult to control,” said Froome’s boss, Dave Brailsford.That is what television demands in the 21st century, and in 2020 it will leave relatively thin pickings for the sprinters, and even less for cycling fans in the northern half of France. But the upside of an almost totally “southern” Tour is that the organisers can use all the mountain ranges of France to the full, beginning in the southern Alps on day two for what promises to be the toughest ever stage on a Tour’s opening weekend.As is now the case in the Vuelta a España, the climbs then hit the riders like a series of straight lefts and rights to the solar plexus. Heading east-west: Orcières-Merlette in the Alps, Mont Aigoual in the Massif Central, and then the Pyrenees with Loudenvielle and Laruns, the latter concluded over the super-steep Col de Marie-Blanque. Added to day two’s climbs that will make for arguably the hardest opening nine days the Tour has ever known.A brief flirtation with the flat – but possibly with the wind to fray the nerves on the Atlantic coast, then east again for a second dose of the Massif Central, including another uphill finish on the Puy Mary, a punchy finish in Lyon and a final week in the Alps. Here the novelties come with bewildering pace: three climbs of the same ridge, the Grand Colombier the toughest finish of the race on the traffic free Col de la Loze at 2,300m, and the gravel Plateau des Glières close enough to the finish at La Roche-sur-Foron for any puncture or crash potentially to decide the race.After which, there is a transfer north for the only time trial, to La Planche des Belles Filles, where there is a surprise: the organisers have not gone the whole hog and included the final gravel section, preferring the safe option of the “conventional” finish where Froome won in 2012. Overall, it is a route that will call for teams stuffed with climbers such as can be fielded only by the bigger-budget squads such as Froome and Bernal’s Ineos and Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo.It will also have a wealth of openings for a rider who is not a climbing specialist but who can compete from day to day through sheer panache and racing ability, such as the nation’s new darling Julian Alaphilippe. The volume of climbing will suit France’s other star of 2019, Thibaut Pinot, although the day-to-day intensity will fray his nerves. The final time trial starts in Pinot’s hometown and finishes in his backyard, but it is a route made for the 2019 winner Bernal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6294906c84b4bd67269f3523fd04b0b7b3c95ec8/0_85_4064_2439/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d10be336ebdb95b51d34836c7a959f4a","title":"japan effort rugby world cup quarter final south africa","story":"Late one night, and lost, drunk, in the dairy aisle of a Tokyo convenience store, I spent five minutes trying to work out whether the carton I’d just picked up had milk in or not. Google Translate’s camera app didn’t help. “Bulgaria!” the label read when I scanned it with my phone, ‘4 arrange the lance! Of bacteria in the hen! Tummy Keep Good.” You get used to it. There are awkward bits and pieces of English all around Japan. “Let’s watch the great power of live battle of men on the big screen!” is my favourite, from a poster advertising a rugby fanzone in Fuchu. The jacket-back slogan “vigorous throw-up – since 1973” is a close second.It isn’t easy getting this stuff right. Just ask your friend in that Superdry hoodie, the one with “extreme speed try test” written across the front in kanji. There are plenty of Japanese words that even the experts struggle to translate exactly. Like doryoku, which comes up over and again when you’re reading or talking about Japanese sport. It means effort, yes, but ability, striving and endeavour, too. And all that still doesn’t quite capture its significance.Fortunately there’s all sorts of lore about the men and women who personified doryoku. Like the champion baseball team at Ichiko school, who used to have a workout regimen called “bloody urine” because they practiced so hard they’d piss red at the end of the day. Or the “death training” philosophy of the famous Waseda baseball coach Suishu Tobita, who wrote “if the players don’t try so hard as to vomit blood in practice, then they cannot hope to win games”.The history of Koshien, Japan’s high school baseball tournament, seems to be full of these stories. Like how the legendary Sadaharu Oh won the title for his school by pitching four games in four days even though he had blisters so bad the blood was dripping down his fingers onto the ball. When he grew up, Oh would to sign his autographs “doryoku”. These are all old and well-worn stories now, and overly-familiar to anyone who knows them, but new for the rest of us.It was doryoku I saw at Yamanote high school, where the kids in the first XV were doing six hours training a day, six days a week. And doryoku I heard about in the words of three teenagers who had come over from New Zealand to play there, when they spoke with awe about how much training they were being made to do. “Back in New Zealand we were training twice a week, here we are training every day, so it’s way more intense,” one of them said, “and these guys are just monsters in gym, they spend too much time there, they all want to get big to climb over everyone they play.”Those kids at Yamanote weren’t the first foreigners to struggle with the concept. The baseball writer Robert Whiting filled his brilliant book, You Gotta Have Wa, with stories about overseas pros who struggled to cope with the workload. Like the former Major League Baseball all-star Davey Johnson, who flopped at the Yomiuri Giants because the endless batting practice gave him a neuroma. And they still wouldn’t let him sit out training.I was thinking about all this while I was talking to Toshiaki Hirose last week. Hirose spent two years playing as Japan’s captain under Eddie Jones. He quit in 2015, but four years later he still winces when you ask him what it was like. “Very hard,” he said, shaking his head, “very, very hard.” But Hirose had come up through Japan’s high school system, same as his teammates, and what I couldn’t work out was how Jones could have worked him any harder than he was already used to.“Yes,” Hirose explained, “in Japan, we always do very long training, even from when we’re very young, but we don’t always do very good training, that’s the difference.” With Jones, he said, it was more about quantity than quality. “Eddie made us train for a short time but at a very high intensity.”There’s a clear echo here of another of the characters in Whiting’s book, the coach Don Blasingame, who was one of the first foreigners to manage a top Japanese baseball team. Blasingame had spent 14 years in Japan as a player and coach when he took over at the Hanshin Tigers in 1979, but it still didn’t work. Blasingame reckoned one of the big problems was that his players were training so hard that they were getting tired in the back half of the season. Just like Jones he told his team it wasn’t how long they practiced that mattered, but how well. He cut down spring camp and practice sessions to half the amount the other teams were doing. The Japanese players hated it. Blasingame was fired after a season and a half.That was 40 years ago though, and this Japan team have managed to fold together the traditional Japanese way of doing things with what Jones and his successor Jamie Joseph learned in Australia and New Zealand. The doryoku is still there. You can see it in their fitness levels, and their frantic speed of play. But their game is about more than hard work now. There are some powerful emotional currents pulling this Japanese team through this World Cup. Joseph wasn’t exaggerating when he said his team are being “driven and supported by the whole country”. More than 60 million people tuned in to watch them beat Scotland. They must appreciate the doryoku, but maybe they’re learning, too, that effort is never enough in itself. Whatever you call it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f2d550da8afd20f6f9b72632e2cd719bee75b11/324_377_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9281b335d1830d28ee67d32bdcc6e32d","title":"out of sorts review theatre 503 london","story":"Theatre 503, LondonDanusia Samal’s complex drama explores the double life of a young Muslim millennial heading for marriageZara is a British-Arab millennial who feels the strain of her double-barrelled identity: to her white British friends, she is a vegan hipster who loves to party. To her Arab refugee family, she is a modern Muslim woman, engaged to her sweetheart, Jameel, and on her way to becoming a lawyer.In reality, Zara (Nalân Burgess) isn’t quite sure of who she wants to be and the conflicted sides of her identity play out in parallel scenes: her family kitchen is on one side of the stage and the trendy breakfast bar of her house-share with her best friend, Alice, is on the other.With Alice, she eats smashed avocado and the two friends share a discomfiting humour that relies on othering Zara’s Arab heritage. When she visits her parents, it is not they but Zara’s more traditional sister, Fatima, who accuses Zara of self-loathing.Not all of the humour works and there are halting moments in the performances, though these are glitches among the play’s greater accomplishments. Oznur Cifci as Fatima, and Myriam Acharki as Zara’s gentle mother, Layla, are spellbinding to watch. And where Out of Sorts might have run the risk of treading familiar ground around culture clash and identity, Danusia Samal’s script gathers complexity and emotion as the piece progresses. It is a play about race and belonging, and a coming-of-age story of friendship and betrayal, of an eating disorder and, most movingly, of the love between mothers and daughters.There is no hint of stereotype in Hussein, Zara’s taxi-driver father, or her mother, a stay-at-home wife who wears a headscarf. It is clear that they have allowed their daughters to choose the lives they want in the west. When Zara returns home as the prodigal daughter, her eyes bloodshot from carousing, they lavish her with love and extravagant pride, even though her cultural rejection of them contains its own pain.Beyond Zara’s two homes, it is clear she is living in a Britain that seethes with race hate. Every non-white character is placed in a racial silo, from Alice’s black British boyfriend, Anthony, who faces casual daily racism, to Fatima, labelled “Bin Laden” by her neighbours for wearing a headscarf, and to Zara’s father, who is called a terrorist by his passengers. Whiteness and “wokeness” are explored, too, through the character of Alice, who, as overbearing and unwittingly offensive as she is, is drawn with compassion. Despite the various hypocrisies and failings of the characters, the drama leaves us moved by each one of them. And for all its identity politics, this play is ultimately about family love, and is deeply tender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30909493d7c59d739e2df49734b9da7edf793794/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76282aba1473c136d19b41be8d651f69","title":"the great british bake off 2019 episode eight live","story":"Welcome to pastry week!

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself.Moscow’s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Nato member Turkey’s troops and Syrian forces. The two sides stopped short of a direct confrontation when Ankara first put boots on the ground in Syria in 2016 to seize the area around Jarablus from Isis, in the process hampering the expansion of the SDF.Erdoğan spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday about the need to prevent armed clashes between Turkish and Syrian regime troops. According to the Kremlin, Putin invited the Turkish leader for a working visit to Moscow “in the coming days” and Erdoğan accepted.As Putin exercised his enhanced influence in Syria, Washington was scrambling to limit the damage of Donald Trump’s acquiescence in the Turkish offensive. After announcing sanctions that critics described as ineffective, Trump dispatched key figures to Ankara including his vice president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and special envoy on Syria, James Jeffrey.A White House statement said Pence would “reiterate President Trump’s commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.”Erdoğan has so far refused to ease military operations, boasting on Tuesday that his troops had seized 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles) of territory from the SDF, an alliance that Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).The SDF was America’s ground partner in the five-year campaign against Isis and lost 11,000 troops in the long battle. Trump has attempted to rebut accusations even from his most loyal supporters that the move amounted to a betrayal.Despite the prospect of losing the area’s semi-autonomous status, Kurdish officials struck a Russian-brokered deal with Damascus on Sunday for reinforcements to protect Kurdish-held border positions. There are unconfirmed reports that talks are still under way to implement a Russian-enforced no-fly zone over the area.Syrian state media showed residents cheering the arrival of troops loyal to Assad in Manbij and Ain Issa, waving flags and throwing rice before the path of soldiers. The regime flag was also briefly raised above the famous clocktower square in Islamic State’s former capital of Raqqa on Monday night, a source in the city said, before it was taken down again by the SDF.Heavy fighting in the border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as well as airstrikes and shelling of other Kurdish-controlled roads and towns has displaced 160,000 people from their homes and killed at least 165 civilians. SDF counterattacks over the border have left 20 Turkish civilians dead, including a Syrian baby.Erdoğan said that despite the threat of US and EU sanctions, as well as European arms embargos, Ankara would press on with the creation of a proposed 20-mile-deep (32km) “safe zone” on its border stretching from Manbij to Iraq, in which Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. Turkey denies the resettlement of mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country would amount to demographic engineering.The offensive has been widely condemned for precipitating a humanitarian crisis and risking the return of Isis, after about 750 people with links to the militant group took advantage of the chaos on Sunday to escape from a Kurdish-run detention camp. Footage of Syrian rebel proxies summarily executing nine Kurdish civilians on a major highway have also prompted allegations of war crimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d96284ece6ab5f8ea750f91a374a1d90c62367bc/128_0_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976fe4ec349993027ef5ece5e9d014a1","title":"six freed after years living in dutch cellar waiting for end of time","story":"Six adults removed from house and man, 58, arrestedA group described by local media as a man and his adult children have been found after spending several years living in the cellar of remote farmhouse in the north-eastern Dutch province of Drenthe “waiting for the end of time”.The group of six were discovered after the oldest son, 25, visited a local bar, the Kastelein cafe. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he “ordered and drank five beers on his own”, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he “looked confused”, Westerbeek said. “He was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.”There was no indication of how long they had lived there or the whereabouts of their mother. The Algemeen Dagblad (AD) newspaper reported that police were considering the possibility that she may have died and been buried on the property.The bar owner told the local Dagblad van het Noorden newspaper that the man had said he had younger brothers and sisters living in the cellar, they all “wanted to end the way they were living”, and he had not been outside for nine years.Six adults were removed and were being taken care of, police confirmed, while a 58-year-old odd-job man who was renting the farmhouse was arrested after refusing to cooperate with their inquiry.Named by local media as Josef B, he is not the father of the young adults, according to police.Several neighbours in the village of 4,000 inhabitants told RTV Drenthe they had only ever seen a man who drove an old Volvo car on the property and assumed he lived there alone, although one said they had seen young children there some years ago and several reported hearing noises from the farm even when the man was absent.One neighbour told the Telegraaf newspaper that the man spoke German and was known in the village as “the Austrian”. The man, who reportedly moved in nine years ago, was “very sharp”, the neighbour said. “You only needed to go near the place and he’d send you packing. He watched everything through binoculars.” While Dutch media said the group were a family, a police spokeswoman refused to confirm the exact relationship or that the young adults’ father was among them, saying the investigation was ongoing.“Our primary concern is for the family members,” she said. “What exactly happened in the farmhouse is still very unclear. We are exploring all possible scenarios.”Citing unnamed sources, RTV Drenthe said that police had found a hidden staircase leading to the family’s hiding place behind a cupboard in the living room. The 58-year-old father was bedridden having suffered a stroke some years ago, it said. The children were aged between 16 and 25.Dutch media said the group appeared to have had little or no contact with the outside world and lived a largely self-sufficient life, apparently growing their own vegetables and keeping a goat and geese.The farmhouse owners, Klaas and Alida Rooze, told AD: “We knew absolutely nothing of this. We had rented the house for years to an inidual and now we learn that a man was living there with children. We have no idea who this can be.”The local mayor, Roger de Groot, told a press conference the situation was extraordinary and that he could give few further details. “For the moment, the police have a lot of unanswered questions,” he said, adding that most of the family appeared not to be registered with local authorities.Police had “assessed the situation and found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where a family was living an isolated existence,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051650.1571169350!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bleeperbike to remove services from d%C3%BAn laoghaire","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBleeperbike began operating in Dún Laoghaire in October 2017 and expanded into Dublin city last year.

Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council last month announced it had awarded a permanent licence to the company. However, in a letter to councillors on Tuesday the council said the company was not taking up its licence and was withdrawing the service.“We regret to announce that Bleeperbike Ireland has decided not to continue with the operation of a stationless bike share scheme in the county and have decided not to take up the offer of a licence to operate such a scheme.”The council said the company informed it of this decision last week “with no indication provided up to this date that they were not going to proceed”. Potential operatorsThe company will remove its bikes on Friday “and then cease operations in the county”, the council said.“It is now our intention to issue a further invite to potential operators to run such a scheme in the county,” it said.Fianna Fáil councillor Cormac Devlin said the move would “come as a surprise to many users” of the bikes. “The Bleeperbike pilot scheme was very popular with the public in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It is very disappointing the company have decided to withdraw their services.”A stationless sharing scheme for the whole of Dublin should be established, he said. Bleeperbike did not respond to requests for comment.Dublin City Council said the company was continuing to operate as normal in its area. “It is anticipated that the service in Dublin city will expand even further in 2020,” a spokeswoman for the council said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dail considers law for new parental leave measure in addition to existing provisionsFoodcloud call on Irish manufacturers to become partners in donating foodVaradkar says progress made but \u0026lsquounclear\u0026rsquo if deal will be struck tonightCurrent ad-hoc approach not desirable or sustainable, public-service pay body saysRosalind Ferguson suffered PTSD after her car was pushed by 42-ton lorry, court hearsSwiatoslaw Jaroszynski (34) was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, court toldOlivia O Mahony (22) was asked by her then partner to accept a transfer of \u0026euro15,000 into her accountBrother of attacked executive Kevin Lunney has property vandalised in Co FermanaghJudge dismisses claim and orders each side to pay their own costsGeraldine Doyle (63) claimed her partner\u0026rsquos pension for four years after he diedJudge says he has \u0026lsquohuge sympathy\u0026rsquo for residents now homeless \u0026lsquothrough no fault of their own\u0026rsquoTaoiseach backs Emma DeSouza\u0026rsquos case: British law \u0026lsquoout of step\u0026rsquo with NI peace treatyFigures are released by treatment purchase fund to Irish Patients\u0026rsquo AssociationNew report voices concerns over the increased potency of the drugTaoiseach was responding to Labour leader\u0026rsquos call for end to clerics \u0026lsquoinstructing\u0026rsquo politicians\u0026lsquoTransparency, accountability\u0026rsquo important at \u0026euro1.25bn agency, housing committee hearsMove comes just days before abortion is due to be decriminalised in NorthFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader criticises Leo Varadkar for giving \u0026lsquopersonal details\u0026rsquo about Timothy Hourihane"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4049751.1571041800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit coveney says deal possible this week as eu seeks uk concessions","story":"Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney TD  has said that  a deal between Britain and the European Union is possible, perhaps even this week, but there are still a lot of details to be worked out. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, last Tuesday. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqAFPGetty Images.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said a Brexit deal is still possible this week, despite the DUP hardening its opposition to a potential solution to the deadlock over the weekend.Speaking on Monday morning, Mr Coveney said: “A deal is possible, and it’s possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we’re not there yet.”“The message I would give is that we need to be cautious, this is not an easy job, we spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides that have made progress at different times, but certainly the last number of months have been difficult,” Mr Coveney said.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to concede more ground to Brussels as UK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital on Monday.Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said “technical-level” talks between officials over the weekend had proved “constructive”.But in a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU27 on Sunday in Brussels, he said that “a lot of work remains to be done”.The BBC reported that the UK has dropped a demand that the deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly. However, DUP MP Jim Shannon this weekend added his voice to opposition to the proposed compromise involving Northern Ireland remaining legally part of the UK customs union but in practice operating as an EU customs territory.Mr Shannon said the proposed “double customs” solution would not work because it would treat Northern Ireland “differently” to Britain.“It is simple. Are we being treated the same as England? No, we are not. Therefore, if we are not being treated the same as England, then we are not going to accept it,” he said.Sticking pointEarlier, Mr Johnson told senior ministers that, while a “pathway” to a deal could still be seen, there was “still a significant amount of work to get there”.In a cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard Border with the Republic.Mr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.There were reported doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.However if Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.Labour however has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the so-called Benn Act which requires to request an extension.Either way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when the prime minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of parliament, the first in 37 years.If he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, laying the ground for a “people versus Parliament” general election.If he is able to get an agreement, UK government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to ratify it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.Some opposition MPs have signalled they could support an agreement if there was a requirement to put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.However, UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated he had little enthusiasm for the idea.“I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be more inclined to support it (if there was a referendum) even if they don’t really agree with the deal.

Video: ReutersThe DUP has said further work is required on UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal as gaps remain over what they can sign up to, following talks at Downing Street.The Northern Irish party’s remarks come as talks are ongoing in Brussels on a possible Brexit deal.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had earlier said progress was being made in the closed-door talks between the EU and UK, but that it was “unclear” if a new deal would be struck tonight.However, he said he was yet to receive a “detailed” briefing from Brussels.He said the gap was still “quite wide” between the EU and UK, particularly on the issue of customs arrangements on the island of Ireland.“The initial indications are that we are making progress,” Mr Varadkar said. “The negotiations are moving in the right direction.”But whether the progress is sufficient to allow for a revised Brexit deal to be presented to the European Council meeting this week is “as of now unclear”, he added.“We are just going to have to see how the next few days go. If we can get to an agreement on Thursday or Friday and if the House of Commons is able to vote in favour of that agreement on Saturday it may not be necessary to even consider an extension but it is too early to make that assessment at this stage.”The Taoiseach also said his preference is still to hold an election in May 2020 and added that, unlike Fianna Fáil, he had not linked the survival of the Government to Brexit.Brussels talksThe prospects for a second EU summit this month continued to loom as the negotiating teams struggled to put legal language on a potential deal.Failure to reach a deal by tonight will see leaders agreeing to reconvene a summit later in the month, either to ratify a deal should the talks produce one, or to discuss an extension.In Luxembourg EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney were resolutely optimistic that a deal could still be done by this evening if the will was there.“Difficult but possible,” Mr Barnier told journalists and then member states at their meeting of Brexit ministers.It was “high time to turn good intentions into legal text,” he said. Speaking to journalists after the meeting Mr Coveney said he did not think “it’s inevitable” there would be no deal in time for a two-day leaders’ summit on Thursday.Progress in the talks was “slow and they will need to make significant progress today,” he said, “ if there is to be a deal that Michel Barnier can report on tomorrow to EU capitals in advance of the leaders’ summit.”Speaking after emerging from a briefing with Mr Barnier on Tuesday, the Tánaiste warned a lot of progress needs to be made over the next 24 hours between the EU and UK negotiating teams.“I don’t think it’s inevitable that they can’t get a deal before the summit,” Mr Coveney said. “I think what Michel Barnier said today was very clear, that it’s difficult but possible to have a deal between the two negotiating teams this side of the leaders’ summit.Mr Coveney emphasised that a legal text was required and said “there will not be negotiation of text at the summit. The EU is very clear on that. So if there is going to be a deal at the summit the task force and the British negotiating team have to finalise text.”Mr Coveney acknowledged “it is of course possible to move beyond the summit and continue talks next week because the UK is not due to leave the EU before the end of the month but from everybody’s perspective if we cloud bring clarity at this summit that would be a welcome development.”Mr Coveney would not be drawn on the substance of the talks but diplomats in Brussels say that, encouraged by Mr Barnier, in broad outline it is being welcomed by member states as the basis of agreement.However, some scepticism remains about the mechanics of the UK’s proposed customs controls.DUP positionSpeaking to BBC Northern Ireland, DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was important that the North remain in the UK customs union in any Brexit deal.“We want to get a deal but it has to be a deal that respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and that means all of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included“I think it’s very important that we say that we must remain within the United Kingdom customs union, it’s a principle that has always been there and a principle that will forever be there. We have to be entirely within the United Kingdom.”“People have to get real and have to understand that we are part of the United Kingdom, will remain part of the United Kingdom and there has to be respect for that.Ms Foster was asked about an EU-UK customs partnership for Northern Ireland, which is said to be the mooted compromise being worked on in negotiations.It would mean the UK, including Northern Ireland, leaving the EU customs union but applying EU customs controls and rules, and collect EU tariffs on goods crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland.Where goods remain in the North or re-enter the rest of the UK, Northern Irish traders could claim back the difference, like a VAT rebate. If products are transported on from the North into the Republic or other parts of the EU, no rebate could be claimed.When asked if she would accept “adhering to EU’s customs rules around tariffs”, Ms Foster replied:“No, because we would have no say over those tariffs and would have no say in relation to how those tariffs were set. So I think it is very important to recognise why we voted against the backstop. If we go back to what was wrong with the backstop in Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. There is no point reinventing that now and just putting that back in again. We have to see flexibility from the European Union just as we have shown flexibility around the single market regulations.”European reactionGoing in to the meeting Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said companies in the Netherlands will have to be assured “there are no byways into the single market from Northern Ireland”.The UK would have to give solid assurances on policing customs controls: “They have given some but not enough,” he said.France’s Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said of the prospects for an extension that France still insisted that one would only be granted if, like an election, “it could change the political dynamic”.There is speculation in Luxembourg that, in the absence of a deal, leaders at the summit may agree to defer consideration of an extension until a second summit, at the end of the month, to allow Mr Johnson maintain his insistence that a deal remains possible that will allow the UK to leave on October 31st.\u0026nbsp– Additional reporting by ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Why, with all he has on his plate, he felt the need to be present at a bread and butter ministerial event announcing a road-building project in Mayo was a mystery. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIt was all kicking off on Tuesday afternoon.Bloomberg reported from Brussels that negotiators were “closing in” on a draft Brexit deal. This nugget dropped minutes before Leo Varadkar began closing in on the Italian Room in Government Buildings with a view to holding forth.The Tánaiste, fresh from a meeting of EU foreign ministers, had paid a flying home-to-brief-the-boss visit and was now closing in on Belfast on his way to yet another Brexit meeting.Back at base, the domestic press corps was joined by representatives of the international media, wondering if Leo Varadkar would announce a deal. Closure, of sorts, at long last.“Key Brexiteers have gone into Number 10 . . . now expecting a press conference any minute from Varadkar as well . . . for what, we don’t know yet,” tweeted the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg in London.But our reporter Fiach Kelly was on the spot in Dublin with the answer.“The N5 Westport to Turlough road!”There are announcements, and there are announcements and then there’s news that the dual carriageway from Turlough, outside Castlebar, to Westport has been given the green light. Now that’s an announcement.Especially if your name is Michael Ring.Everyone was pure weak with the excitement, and that’s not including the Minister for Mayo, who was reportedly on the verge of passing out earlier on but managed nonetheless to put in a superhuman effort to show up for the big reveal.It wasn’t much of a reveal because Ringo was already up on the social media starring in a video shot on the side of a busy road with him bellowing above the traffic about the fantastic new road while avoiding being mown down by a lorry.The Taoiseach also let the cat out of the bag in the Dáil, announcing the commencement of the new Westport to Turlough road as one of his Government’s many triumphs on the transport front.As a young country, he said, Ireland doesn’t have the infrastructure of places like London or Paris. But “things are now really kicking off in terms of transport investment”.Finally kicking offWhich is great, but would his later appearance at Government Buildings be a sign that things were finally kicking off in the Brexit department?The media had been lured to Merrion Street with a mildly enticing “Government to make significant infrastructure announcement” email, no further details attached, followed by the real draw: “An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, will attend if scheduling permits.”Where did we see that before? Why, last week, when a similarly vague missive issued with the promise: “The Taoiseach may also attend subject to his availability.”Funnily enough, it transpired Leo was available last week and, luckily, he was available this week too, which was convenient as the rest of Europe wanted to hear his latest take on the evolving Brexit situation.It being a Tuesday, Leo had to rush across from Dáil Éireann after his usual session in the House. Why, with all he has on his plate, he felt the need to be present at a bread-and-butter ministerial event announcing the green light for a road-building project in Mayo was a mystery.And sure, if there are rumours of a general election in the offing to be denied with gung-ho sincerity while blaming Fianna Fáil for fuelling the speculation in the first instance, why not do that as well?Meanwhile, Simon Coveney was in the chamber for Leaders’ Questions. The poor man needed the rest.Cool bro handshakeA few hours earlier he was in Luxembourg doing interviews and shootin’ the breeze with his homie Michel Barnier (check out the cool bro handshake between the two). He returned to Dublin later in the morning and briefed the Taoiseach on the Brexit state of play.Following his brief respite in the chamber and a sobering hour listening to the real issues – “It is a fact that it has been raining in Kerry for at least seven weeks – Danny Healy-Rae” – the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs hit the road again. This time for Belfast.It was all kicking off.Simon comes over as a very meticulous and thorough inidual. One imagines when he briefs somebody on a particular issue, he leaves nothing out. And there is nothing he doesn’t know about Brexit. Leo will have been well briefed before he left to go north.So once the announcement about the new road was out of the way – Minister for Transport Shane “Winston Churchtown” Ross was most gracious about it in the few minutes he got to speak and Ring was so delighted it rendered him uncharacteristically subdued – the questions began. It was all about Brexit and related questions about a Brexit-induced general election.Apart from being cautiously optimistic about the ongoing negotiations, the Taoiseach had very little to say. But he was happy to stand in front of the cameras and say it.“In terms of Brexit negotiations I’ve a confession to make. Tuesday is a pretty crazy day and I’ve spent the morning at Cabinet and the afternoon in the chamber so I’ve to go back to the office now and get a briefing from Brussels.”Poor Simon. Talk about a kick in the teeth. Then again, it was the very same last week when Leo made an unexpected appearance at a minor gig. He got out the message that while he hadn’t seen what were called “non-papers” from the UK side, he wasn’t happy about them.Positivity lineThis time, while not knowing very much, he still got out the positivity line.And perish the thought he was going to this announcement because an election is in the offing.“I’m confident we will have many more announcements like this before we go to the polls.” Every Tuesday, for starters, by the look of it.Ring was delighted. Speaking as somebody who “was born and reared” in the west of Ireland he was very happy to see this new stretch of the N5 getting the go ahead. “For 25 years I’ve been lobbying for this road.”“There’s a lot of happy people in Mayo today,” he declared.Not least Enda Kenny. He should be happiest of the lot, given that he announced the project as part of the six-year Capital Plan in 2015 and made sure to ring-fence the money before leaving office.The Taoiseach name-checked him in the supplied press release, but he wasn’t mentioned at the press conference. On the big day, after all his effort, the big announcement went ahead without him.Enda was in Tokyo when it finally kicked off."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051618.1571161771!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s diplomatic tour de force praised as macron prepares for summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Council president Donald Tusk and French president Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Monday. Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonEPAThe Irish Government has been praised in Paris for its conduct throughout the Brexit saga.“Dublin in a position of strength,” said a headline in Le Monde following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s meeting with prime minister Boris Johnson last Thursday.The UK repeatedly made the mistake of trying to “bilateralise” Brexit negotiations, an adviser to French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, while pointing out that EU unity did not preclude contacts between political leaders. For example, Macron spoke to Johnson on the telephone on Tuesday morning.“When Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar saw each other a few days ago, Ireland played the European game perfectly,” the adviser at the Élysée said. “Mr Johnson made political overtures, and it was referred to the 27 for negotiations. It’s not Mr Varadkar or the Irish team negotiating with the British today. It’s Michel Barnier and his team.”‘Supported’The Élysée sees EU solidarity with Ireland as a shining lesson of the benefits of EU membership. “It is the profound meaning of the EU project that a member state which is in difficulty, whether it be an attack, an economic threat or a political difficulty, must be supported by the others,” the adviser said.“If belonging to the EU means anything, it is that there must be no ambiguity or hesitation about protecting the fundamental interests of a member state, and that is valid whatever the size of the country. It is valid for a country of five million inhabitants, like Ireland.”The fact that the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the EU’s only land border with Britain was “the second reason why Ireland was at the heart of the negotiations”, the adviser added.Though the Élysée hoped for an imminent agreement, the adviser warned that the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday must not be “a catch-up session or the continuation of technical or detailed negotiations. It will be the moment to endorse or formalise a political agreement, but in no event a nocturnal extension of tough negotiations”.Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will co-ordinate their positions at a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse on Wednesday, where they will be joined by their ministers for defence, foreign affairs, European affairs, finance, culture and the interior.The meeting will focus on trade tensions with the US and co-operation in industry and innovation, in particular artificial intelligence and military procurement. Paris and Berlin are developing a combat aircraft and a battle tank together.Toulouse is the site of the Airbus 350 assembly line, considered one of the most successful Franco-German projects.International eventsFranco-German relations are often rendered difficult because of international events external to them, the adviser said. “It’s the situation that is difficult, not France and Germany. ”Macron’s approach has been to attempt to reach compromise on areas of discord, such as the reform of the euro zone, not to paper over disagreement.The French president believes “there is no alternative or possible substitute for the Franco-German relationship. It is irreplaceable,” the adviser continued. But, at the same time, it is “not an exclusive relationship”. Under Macron, “France is working much more with other partners, for example the Netherlands and central Europe, than before.”Macron received a stinging rebuke from the European Parliament when it vetoed the appointment of Sylvie Goulard as a member of the European Commission. Macron had secured a weighty portfolio for her, including the internal market, industry, defence, space, digital technology and culture.The Élysée said the attributes of the portfolio reserved for France must not change. Macron wants the “political instability” of the parliament, which has no clear political majority, to be addressed before he chooses a new commissioner.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire Former US special envoy to Northern Ireland Gary Hart has become the latest senior figure to raise concerns about the impact of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.In a letter to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Hart, who held the position between 2013 and 2017, expressed concern about the possible restoration of a hard border on the island of Ireland.He called on the committee to “make clear to the government of the United Kingdom and European Union officials the absolute necessity of protecting the Good Friday Agreement by maintaining the status quo on that border”.Mr Hart, who was appointed by former secretary of state John Kerry, was the last person to hold the position that was also held by senator George Mitchell and Richard Haass.Mr Hart, a former US senator was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988.The issuance of the letter came after members of the ad hoc committee to protect the Good Friday Agreement – an informal group of senior Irish-Americans established this year amid concerns about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland – met senior representatives from the British embassy in Washington.There has been an increased interest in Northern Ireland and the possible impact of a hard Brexit on the peace process in Washington as the Brexit stalemate continues.Mr Hart’s intervention comes ahead of this week’s key European Council in Brussels.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureKPMG’s prediction is in line with no-deal expectations by the government’s spending watchdog: in July the Office for Budget Responsibility said house prices will drop by 5.9 per cent in 2020.On the other hand, if a Brexit agreement is struck before 31 October, the housing market will avoid slipping into the red, according to S\u0026ampP. It sees a 1.5 per cent price rise in 2020 after stagnation this year.“We believe that Brexit uncertainty has already started to trickle down into lower housing prices and sales volumes, especially in London,” the agency said.According to the latest official data, house prices inched up by 0.7 per cent in July compared with a year earlier – the slowest pace of growth in almost seven years. Figures for August are due on Wednesday.The sluggish growth in prices will be welcomed by those yet to get onto the housing ladder.“House prices have been expensive here for quite some time,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier on Tuesday, adding that housing affordability is “a challenge”.“It’s first and foremost driven by supply dynamics in the country. It continues to strike me that there is twice as many people in the United Kingdom as there is in my native Canada and the same amount of houses are built every year in the United Kingdom as in Canada.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, commented: “We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance.”By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market, which will ultimately save customers money.“The proposals come more than two years after the FCA launched a review into car financing in response to concerns about questionable practices in the sector.It will consult on the plans until 15 January, with final rules set to be published later in 2020.The FCA warned the sector in March to clean up its act amid concerns over the commission charged on car finance plans for new cars.Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: “The announcement from the FCA today will be welcome news to anyone buying a car from a dealership. For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Woodford will also be removed from his position as the fund’s investment manager with immediate effect.Mr Woodford, one of Britain’s best-known investment managers, was forced to freeze the fund\u0026nbspafter a run of poor performance scared investors into withdrawing their cash. That left the fund unable to sell off assets fast enough to meet further redemption requests.An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.The suspension was intended to give Mr Woodford\u0026nbsptime to change the composition of the portfolio to enable him to meet redemption requests.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

This orderly realisation will allow the return of money through interim payments ... to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.”Mr Woodford commented:\u0026nbsp“This was Link’s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.”Many of the hundreds of thousands of savers who still have money locked in the fund are likely to get back less than what they originally invested.One investor who has invested with Mr Woodford for a number of years said: “I’ve lost almost £2,000 in his fund as I’m invested via my Hargreaves Lansdown Sipp and think HL has some questions to answer about promoting a fund that is now worthless.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSince Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis no longer the manager of the fund, it will be renamed as LF Equity Income Fund.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with social aims.\u0026nbspHe added: Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues

researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.“Pay growth continues to outstrip inflation, as it has done for over eighteen months now.Despite the 0.1 per cent rise in\u0026nbspunemployment to 3.9 per cent, the proportion of people jobless remains at its lowest level since the 1970s.The number of job vacancies fell again to 813,000, its lowest level since late 2017.“This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, it could also be evidence that the uncertainty around Brexit is starting to impact firms’ hiring decisions. The survey evidence is consistent with a further softening in employment and wage growth going forward too.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, commented: “We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance.”By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market, which will ultimately save customers money.“The proposals come more than two years after the FCA launched a review into car financing in response to concerns about questionable practices in the sector.It will consult on the plans until 15 January, with final rules set to be published later in 2020.The FCA warned the sector in March to clean up its act amid concerns over the commission charged on car finance plans for new cars.Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: “The announcement from the FCA today will be welcome news to anyone buying a car from a dealership. For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They included an experiment known as Labeled Release, or LR, which was intended to look for signs of life on the planet.The results came back in 1976 – and seemed to indicate that something was happening on the surface.\u0026nbspGilbert V\u0026nbspLevin – an engineer and inventor who was the principal investigator on the experiment – has now written a long article arguing that those findings were indications of life on Mars, which were ignored by Nasa.“On July 30, 1976, the LR returned its initial results from Mars,” Levin wrote in an article for Scientific American.\u0026nbsp”Amazingly, they were positive.“As the experiment progressed, a total of four positive results, supported by five varied controls, streamed down from the twin Viking spacecraft landed some 4,000 miles apart. The data curves\u0026nbspsignaled\u0026nbspthe detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet. The curves from Mars were similar to those produced by LR tests of soils on Earth.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 September“It seemed we had answered that ultimate question.”But Nasa’s experiments failed to find organic matter: the physical stuff of life itself, not just the indications of microbial respiration that the LR experiment discovered. That meant that Nasa concluded that the LR results came from a substance that was mimicking life but was not actually life itself.Comet visiting our solar system is ‘like nothing seen before’Since then, Nasa has not a run a similar experiment has focused on examining whether the Martian habitat could be a suitable home for alien life.But Levin argues that those findings actually suggested that\u0026nbspthere is alien life on Mars. And, he argued, Nasa must do more to follow them up – because they could pose a significant threat to life on Earth.“NASA maintains the search for alien life among its highest priorities,” he wrote.\u0026nbspOn February 13, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said we might find microbial life on Mars.“Our nation has now committed to sending astronauts to Mars. Any life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.”Summing up the evidence of alien life, he wrote his experiment had found a whole host of positive results. But perhaps most strongly of all, he said there had been no experiment that had provided an alternative explanation for the results that came back from the LV experiment.“What is the evidence against the possibility of life on Mars? The astonishing fact is that there is none,” he wrote. “Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.”In his conclusion, he asked that Nasa\u0026nbspconduct the same kind of experiments again, taking an altered version of the LR experiment to Mars on the next possible trip. And he asked that scientists be convened to examine those more than 40-year-old findings to see if they really were proof of life on Mars.“Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp”In any event, the study would likely produce important guidance for NASA’s pursuit of its holy grail.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Woodford will also be removed from his position as the fund’s investment manager with immediate effect.Mr Woodford, one of Britain’s best-known investment managers, was forced to freeze the fund\u0026nbspafter a run of poor performance scared investors into withdrawing their cash. That left the fund unable to sell off assets fast enough to meet further redemption requests.An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.The suspension was intended to give Mr Woodford\u0026nbsptime to change the composition of the portfolio to enable him to meet redemption requests.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

This orderly realisation will allow the return of money through interim payments ... to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.”Mr Woodford commented:\u0026nbsp“This was Link’s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.”Many of the hundreds of thousands of savers who still have money locked in the fund are likely to get back less than what they originally invested.One investor who has invested with Mr Woodford for a number of years said: “I’ve lost almost £2,000 in his fund as I’m invested via my Hargreaves Lansdown Sipp and think HL has some questions to answer about promoting a fund that is now worthless.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSince Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis no longer the manager of the fund, it will be renamed as LF Equity Income Fund.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with social aims.\u0026nbspHe added: Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties.

The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues

researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.“Pay growth continues to outstrip inflation, as it has done for over eighteen months now.Despite the 0.1 per cent rise in\u0026nbspunemployment to 3.9 per cent, the proportion of people jobless remains at its lowest level since the 1970s.The number of job vacancies fell again to 813,000, its lowest level since late 2017.“This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, it could also be evidence that the uncertainty around Brexit is starting to impact firms’ hiring decisions. The survey evidence is consistent with a further softening in employment and wage growth going forward too.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable.The lawyer for the first intelligence whistleblower is also representing a second whistleblower regarding the President\u0027s actions. Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community\u0027s inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump’s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president’s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a “shadow” foreign policy.The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House.The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later.Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn’t even want to.The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump’s opponent in the 2020 election.Joe Biden’s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden’s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong.The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump’s preoccupations with the Biden’s and the Clinton emails.The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: “The president must be held accountable.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube. But that has nothing to do with weight . . . and everything to do with how off-putting it is to sit next to someone scoffing a stinking kebab.It is pretty straightforward to work outsomeone wants to have sex with you. And more importantly, when they don’t.Both my kids know how to respect others, as well as themselves. They learned it well before they got to uni.If you need to do this course when you start at university, it might already be too late.THE issue of kne crime in the capital was brought closer to home than ever for me when a schoolboy was stabbed at .pm in Stratford, East London.The attack took place in broad daylight, just after school ended, on West Ham’s doorstep.Just like that, another le was snuffed out and a family devastated.We must finally make this a priority before yet more children die needlessly.What will her one-year-old twins Leo and Lenon thinkthey read that in years to come  Maybe they will assume she was joking.Each of my two kids thinks I prefer the other one.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You failed to turn around the business.You couldn’t hide these numbers forever, they caught up with you. Isn’t that the truth Mr Meysman tried to argue the firm was still going well in many areas, but was slapped down by Ms Reeves.She raged: You are here today because , people have lost their jobs, , people were on their holiday and had to be brought home...You have brought down a  year business with huge repercussions for customers, staff and taxpayers.Ill point to the failures, and they hugely outweigh the successes you have spoken about.You and your colleagues offered some apologies... I think you are deluded about the business, Mr Meysman, you ran.When you are pointing to the successes, you might want to have a little bit more humility, Mr Mesyman.Top MP Frank Field today demanded they hand their money back to the firm.He said: If they’ve had a chance to check how their own pensions are affected, perhaps the high-paid executives responsible would like to bolster the retirement of some of the workers they left behind, and give some of it back Mr Fankhauser said he inherited a huge debt pile when he came into the role, but had paid back millions in interest and refinancing cost.The firm had multiple profit warnings before he even arrived, he said today.Yesterday the Government outlined plans to allow failed airlines to repatriate passengers so Brits wont be left stranded in future.A number of airlines have gone bust in recent years, with the collapse of Monarch Airlines in  leaving thousands stranded abroad.We explain how to protect yourselfyour airline or holiday provider goes under."},{"url":null,"title":"woman gallbladder stomach liquid nitrogen drink","story":"Stacey Wagers, , says she felt an “explosion” in her chest when she sipped the water served by a waiter at the Don CeSar Hotel in St Pete Beach, Florida.She has now filed a lawsuit against the company after the November  incident left her insides badly burned and with lelong digestive issues.Stacey had been celebrating a friend’s birthday but was later rushed to hospital where she had her gallbladder and part of her stomach cut from her body.The waiter had put the liquid nitrogen – which can reach temperatures as low as -F - into the glass to give it a smokey effect, Stacey’s lawsuit says.After taking one sip, the -year-old said she felt “like I was dying” when the nitrogen burned through her organs.She told NBC: “There was an explosion in my chest that occurred within seconds of drinking the water.“I couldn’t speak.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bobbie Cook, , was partying with pals in Ibiza when she dropped her passport. She didnapost realise what happened, but a picture taken in superclub Pacha later showed the document lying on the ground in front of her. The tourist, from Essex, set off on a five-day trip to Ibiza on October  - but didnapost expect it to take a turn for the worst. Bobbie and her friend Becca booked their trip with Loveholidays and were due to travel via Thomas Cook airlines, but the operator cancelled their trip just two days prior to their travels. The pair were left scrambling to book last minute flights and hotels - but ended up missing their flight due to plane delays. Speaking about the ordeal, Bobbie said she realised her passport was missing on her second night.    She stated: On her second night, Bobbie and her friends went to a club called Pacha for music event when she realised her passport went missing. In a state of panic, she began rummaging through her bag and searching everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found. Bobbie said: As the night went on I kept checking my bag and I told Becca I canapost find my passport but she kept telling me itaposs probably at home. I kept retracting my steps and checking the toilets, lost property, asking behind the bar and looking around that exact spot where we was taking photos and I couldnapost find it at all! I probably spend most of my night trying to find it.    Becca kept telling me itaposs probably back at the hotel so thereaposs no point in worrying but all I could think about was how was I supposed to get home. Bobbie applied for an emergency passport on Friday, but had to wait another four days as the British consulate does not process documents at weekends - meaning she would miss herflight on Monday. She said: I was so scared I didnapost know how I was gonna manage on my own! Becca wanted to stay with me but she couldnapost because it was vital she went home for work as she had too much time off already. Luckily one of my others friends I knew from back home said she she would stay out there with mewhich was a huge weight lted from my shoulders, at least I knew she was gonna help me. I would have been useless on my own. Bobbie was looking through some of her Ibiza holiday photos when she came across a picture of her at Pacha, and was shocked after realising her missing passport was on the floor right in front of her.

Molly Bower, , from Durham, fell ill when she was on holiday in Majorca and died away as a result of complications from the infection on Friday. The teen complained of a swollen face soon after she arrived on holiday with her aunt and uncle and within less than  hours of seeing a hotel doctor, she was dead. Her aunt has recalled the moment her eyes rolled back and she suddenly stopped breathing.Dominique Bower told the Daily Mail Molly had become delirious and wasnapost eating on Thursday night.   She had complained of an aching body and said she couldnapost hear what people was saying, and at first thought she had an abscess. The resort doctor at Club Mac Alcudia where the family were staying immediately diagnosed Molly with Mumps, her aunt said. Molly had been vaccinated against mumps as a child, her family said. However doctors fear the decline in families opting to get their kids the childhood jab MMR that wards off measles, mumps and rubella could lead to increased death rates among youngsters.    The doctor prescribed ibuprofen and paracetamol, Miss Bower said. Within a few seconds of taking it, Molly drted off to sleep. We later tried to wake her for a shower, we couldn’t get her to walk, it was like carrying a dead weight. I left the room for five minutes afterwards to get her more clothes and the next thing I knew I heard screaming [from a family friend]. Molly’s eyes had rolled into the back of her head and she had stopped breathing.’ Doctors reportedly tried to save the teen for two hours before she was moved to hospital, where she later died from complications arising from mumps. Now her family is desperately trying to get her body home.

Jason Farrell, , allegedly attacked -year-old Sammy-Lee Lodwig at his flat and then confessed that he had sliced her up, but he denied charges of murder, wounding with intent and unlawful wounding, the court heard. Swansea Crown Court heard that the defendant used to date his victimaposs mother and in the days before the attack had been heard expressing a desire to hurt and kill Sammy-Lee, her mother Sarah and Christopher Maher, the man he suspected of being in a relationship with Ms Lodwig senior. Prosecutor Michael Jones told the jury: He was, in short, jealous. Mr Jones read from a chilling letter written by Farrell after his arrest in which he wrote: We went back to my flat and we started arguing.  Then the next thing I had her tied up and told her Iaposd had enough and I was going to kill her. I did by repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat. Farrell, who denies murder, started a relationship with his victim after she became a regular visitor to his flat for drugs, the court was told. Mr Jones said Farrell knocked at a neighbouraposs window on April , saying: I killed her. A friend of the neighbour went with six-foot-tall Farrell to his flat in Carlton Terrace in the Mount Pleasant area of Swansea.  There, he saw the body of Ms Lodwig, who was ft ins and weighed six stone, on a bed. Farrell fled after the emergency services were alerted and paramedics found his girlfriend fully-clothed, with cuts across her throat and forehead and severe bleeding on the bedding. It was estimated that Ms Lodwig died  or  minutes before they arrived. A black-handled kitchen kne covered in blood, with the tip of its cm blade missing, was found next to the bed.  Forensic scientist Claire Morse said it appeared the woman had been assaulted while on the bed. Mr Jones also said knotted and blood-stained dressing gown belts with traces of Ms Lodwigaposs saliva were found nearby, suggesting they may have been in or around her mouth. Injuries to her neck damaged major arteries and veins, while wounds to her chest were deep enough to enter both her lungs. The cause of death was established as stab wounds to her neck and chest. The court heard that later that morning Farrell phoned a friend, telling her: Iaposve killed her. I had enough. She wouldnapost shut up. I sliced her up, adding that it had been a slow death.

Fiorenzo Sauro, , had  protected trees illegally felled to build  homes. The redwood, in Penllergaer, Swansea, South Wales, was one of the first in Britain, planted in . Swansea council tree officer Alan Webster told a court the tree was “irreplaceable”. He added: “This is ancient woodland dating back hundreds of years. It is important.’ Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were yesterday found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order by magistrates in Swansea, south Wales. The tree contractor who carried out the illegal felling was fined another £, for the destruction in the ancient woodlands. A court heard the towering ft tree was estimated to be worth more than £, but, in reality, it was “irreplaceable”. Sauro said the felling was an accident - but a judge ruled he “deliberately” ordered it to be chopped down to make way for  new homes.    Sauro and his company, Enzo Homes Ltd, were ordered to stump up a fine totalling £, by a district judge in Swansea, South Wales. Enzo Homes were fined £, while Sauro was fined £,. Annabel Graham-Paul, prosecuting, said: “This was an intentional breach or flagrant disregard for the law. “The trees felled are irreplaceable natural resources. The soils in the ancient woodland can never be replicated. “Swansea Council aim to replace the trees within two years but the ancient woodlands are irreplaceable and the redwood is going to take a long time to grow back to its former glory so it is by no means going to be a like for like replacement.” Swansea Magistrate’s Court heard Sauro made “no financial gain” from felling the trees and is involved with the council’s plans to replant what was cut down.    Alex Goodman, representing Sauro said: “Sauro has sourced replacement trees at his own expense which are being carefully nurtured in a nursery. “This reflects Sauro’s remorse and regret for what happened.” District judge Neale Thomas said: “I find it dficult to equate the harm to a monetary value. The harm is much greater. “It is inconceivable on this evidence the felling of this tree and the ancient woodland was done in any other way than deliberately. “There would have been discussions about how it was to be done, permission obtained to remove the fence and any other preparatory work.”  “Mr Sauro caused the destruction of these trees in the most obvious way: namely by directing they should be felled. “This is a deliberate planned breach of the tree preservation order and in defiance of it”. Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order. Both the company and its director were also ordered to contribute a total of £, towards the prosecution costs. A court heard the firm were developing  houses at the site in Penllergaer Estate, Swansea, when the trees were chopped.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former athlete has told of how he became an alcoholic and ended up sleeping on the streets after a rugby injury turned his le upside down. James Gwinnett, , was lucky to walk away when he fractured part of his spine in a rugby tackle which almost paralysed him. But his le as he knew it was over and he suffered severe boredom during the months off work that followed. There is only so much daytime TV you can watch, he toldin a candid exclusive chat. Those three months were dficult. The problem I had was that I would drink a lot of beer through the pure boredom . During this period at home alone, I would have one beer and then two, then three and it escalated and it spiralled quickly. I did sleep rough as a generalisation. When drunk, I would miss the last train out of Charing Cross station and then sleep rough outside it infrequently. I look back now and that was very dangerous. I also once slipped over and cracked my head open.    James, who lives in Harrow, northwest London, became frustrated by his sudden loss of routine and downed up to  pints each day for around two years. He added: I have always a big drinker socially. I have always had a problem in that most people will have four or five drinks with friends and say aposI feel a bit tipsyapos and say aposthat is enoughapos but for some reason my brain doesnapost have that switch. Routine is incredibly important to me. Rugby gave me that routine. My week was geared towards that Saturday afternoon match, and then Iaposd train and eat healthily for the next match. Losing that routine as well as losing that camaraderie in going out with my rugby teammates afterwards was dficult.    But since his traumatic fight with addiction between the February  accident and April , James has transformed his le with simple goals. Despite being at his worst ebb, he was inspired to train for the  London Marathon, conquered the test and has since reached the final of the gruelling SAS: Who Dares Wins challenge. James, originally from Tonbridge, Kent, is this year running km in ious stints and has already exceeded km. He said: Consultants told me not to continue [playing]. I was quite close to near paralysis because I had crushed discs between the vertebrae. I was lucky to walk away from the accident. But I was told by specialists and physios I was able to do the marathon and other challengesI cared for my body and trained in moderation.  He continued: I watched the  London Marathon on TV and it just hit me. This was the jolt I needed to turn my le around, so to speak. I find it hard to motivate myselfI donapost have specic goals in mind. So after two to three years drinking heavily, I saw these people pushing themselves to their limits, their incredible limits and thought aposI should do thatapos. Over the next year, I set myself manageable targets, that way you can break any goal down. That goal-orientated mentality is very important to me. Having broken my neck and everything , I am very interested in how the body is very fragile but you can also achieve great things with it. I am still interested in pushing myself further. That is quite philosophical but interesting. I am aware of my body and to take care of my body.  And remarkably, James reached the last eight in the final of the Channel  SAS contest, in which ex-Special Forces soldier Ant Middleton pits contestants against harsh environments across the world that replicate gruelling tasks in military selection processes.

He said heaposd never been to school and hadnapost been to the barber for nine years.    He said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm.

A multinational task force is trying to track down Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China who is suspected of leading a vast drug network that accumulates up to billion a year. The syndicate provides tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries in the Asia-Pacic region, from Japan to New Zealand, authorities believe. Meth, a powerful drug that can create very strong psychological and physical dependence, is believed to be the networkaposs main business. Tse, who is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, flies by private jet and once lost million in a single night at a Macau casino, police say. His narcotics empire was allegedly born out of an alliance of five of Asiaaposs triad groups. Police have dubbed the network Sam Gor, Cantonese for Brother Number Three, which recalls one of Tseaposs nicknames, but its members simply call it The Company. In , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  estimated the syndicateaposs revenue at billion a year, but says it could be as high as . billion.   The agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a  percent to  percent share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years, according to a Reuters investigation .A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart believes Tse is the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate, but police have not publicly identied him as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacic representative for UNODC, said: “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more erse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australiaaposs biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia, Reuters reports. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” one veteran Western anti-drugs official said. “Theylike a global corporation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first human baby born space","story":"NewsFirst human baby born in space will be delivered within the next  yearsDr Egbert Edelbroek, founder and chief executive of SpaceBorn United, made the huge claims at the first Space and Science Congress of Asgardia the Space Nation in Darmstadt, GermanyShareCommentsByNina Massey:,  OCT NewsFeet of a newborn baby are seen under a ultraviolet lamp\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

This is only possible, for now, in Lower Earth Orbit , and it is only possible thanks to a very thorough selection procedure, he said. The congress heard some of the requirements for participant expectant mothers, and medical staff.  These would include having experience of two flawless previous deliveries, and a high natural radiation resistance. Dr Edelbroek said: You can induce the labour process like they do in IVF clinics on a daily basis.Planning is, of course, an issue - it is hard to plan a natural process like thisthere is something wrong with the weather , or a delay with the launch.We could never work with just one pregnant woman.  We would have maybe  participants and they could step out at any moment. But the experts that we work with, they believe, and I believe, that this is possible at a lower risk level than an average Western-style delivery on Earth.

The guest of honour was Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s then Prime Minister, now the President. Trump, in between plugging the US version of The Apprentice, heaped praise on Erdogan. He said: “The Prime Minister is very highly respected.” Last week Trump did Erdogan another favour by withdrawing US troops from northern Syria where they were helping Kurdish forces contain the Islamic State threat. The US President effectively gave Erdogan the green light to launch an invasion, he calls it a “peace operation”, aimed at forcing out the Kurds from the region. What happens next could determine the fate of the Middle East and could redraw the battle lines in the power struggle between Russia and the West.    Erdogan is standing over a powder keg with a lit torch. When the EU protested at his military incursion he threatened to send into Europe the . million Syrian refugees Brussels has paid Turkey £.billion to look after. At the UN last month he lectured other nations about the refugees as he held a photo of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey in  after drowning trying to cross the Mediterranean. Nor does he appear to care that the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces are being driven into the arms of Syria’s dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Turkish president has never been afraid of making enemies. Which may be just as well as he is about to make a lot more of them. Born in , the son of a coastguard, he supplemented the family’s meagre income by selling lemonade on Istanbul’s streets. After attending Islamic School he did a degree in business management before taking his first steps into politics. In the s he joined the Islamist National Salvation Party, challenging the secular tradition that had been the hallmark of Turkey since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s presidency in the s.    When Erdogan was banned from taking his seat in parliament in  he successfully stood to be Mayor of Istanbul in . In  he was jailed for four months for reading out an Islamist poem that included the lines “the mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.” Two years later he founded the Justice and Development Partywhich swept to power in  with Erdogan as Prime Minister. His initial years in power saw him reach out to a West that was, in those days, still hoping that Turkey could one day join the EU. Critics of his tendency to accumulate power and silence critics were won over by his economic reforms and technocratic flair. But it became increasingly hard to ignore his authoritarian tendencies. In  he became the country’s first directly-elected president. Then in  he used the aborted military coup to impose a state of emergency that saw him throttle dissent and imprison opponents. He then held a referendum in  to grant himself more powers. Erdogan abolished the post of Prime Minister and gave himself the right to appoint ministers and senior civil servants, issue decrees and oversee all security matters.    The United Nations Human Rights Office said the scale of the repression was “staggering”. In the past three years nearly , people have been arrested , civil servants sacked teachers, judges and lawyers prosecuted on trumped-up charges  journalists arrested , websites blocked and  media outlets shut down. Like Trump he is not adverse to large scale building projects, though his recently completed presidential palace in Ankara makes Trump Towers look like an exhibit from LegoLand. The building cost £million and has more than , rooms, including a laboratory where scientists can check the president’s food has not been poisoned. In the first sign that Erdogan’s grip on power may be fading, his party lost the Istanbul elections in March. After ordering a re-run on the unproven charges of vote rigging he was defeated again with the Republican People’s Party winning by an even bigger margin. The economy has also begun to slow with unemployment reaching % and inflation nudging %. His invasion of northern Syria is seen by some as a classic example of a leader using a military exercise to distract attention from domestic failings. Having won power as a nationalist hard man, Erdogan would have looked weakhe failed to move against Kurds he has long accused of being terrorists. The brutality witnessed on the domestic front has now extended to the foreign. Airstrikes on Kurdish territory by Turkey forces have killed innocent children and caused thousands of civilians to flee the area. Any chance of Turkey joining the EU has evaporated because of Erdogan’s autocratic rule. This has pushed the Turkish leader closer towards Vladimir Putin.

Hundreds of staff have already left, many taking retirement or finding work where.Michelin has offered numerous incentives to help staff find alternative employment, while also working with Dundee City Centre and Scottish Enterprise to turn the Baldovie site into a new innovation centre focusing on sustainable transport and low-carbon energy.But it seems some workers have still fallen through the cracks and are now struggling to make ends meet.Currently, staff at the Stobswell foodbank know of at least two former Michelin workers who regularly attend.Foodbank boss Ken Linton has been helping to feed families for more years than he cares to remember.He runs four centres in and around the city, including a warehouse, and has  volunteers in total.Ken said: “I’m looking forward to the day I turn out the lights.”“I think it’s a disgrace that in this day and age there is a need for foodbanks.“But it is what it is and we get very good support from the local supermarkets which have collections for us.“Universal Credit, without a doubt, is a big cause of this. The change over hits people hard.“They cannot expect people to wait for six weeks for money after they were receiving it every fortnight.”Wedding photographer Siobhan Diamond, , who volunteers at St John’s Episcopal Church on Albert Street said: “I have been here nearly a year but this is a sticking plaster to the problem and will not fix everyone’s situation.“It is good that we can help and a lot of people like to talk to me over a cup of tea or coffee when they come in, which is nice.“Some people have come in and broken down in tears because of their situation and that is always dficult.“One man said he was ashamed because he could not feed his children.“But I told him he was brave and said that it would not be brave to sit at home and starve.”One client in his s at the St John’s foodbank said: “I have had drug issues and been in and out of prison.“I would shoplt to sell stuff to buy food, but then someone told me about this place.“I would have ended up selling drugs to survive and this has helped me stay clear of any trouble and get my le back on track.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da433c13886b5.15655741-847x564.jpg ","title":"scotland gaffer clarke hails dundee united man shankland as scots romp to victory","story":"Scotland boss Steve Clarke was impressed by Lawrence Shankland’s overall performance as the Dundee United striker scored on his first international start.Shankland claimed his th goal of the season in a - win over San Marino on Sunday, netting from the rebound after Scott McTominay’s effort had crashed off the bar .The -year-old forward made his debut as a half-time substitute in the - defeat in Russia but was more involved at Hampden as Scotland got back to winning ways following four consecutive defeats.Clarke said: “I thought he was good, a lot of good hold-up play, links the play well, gets the ball in.“Scored a striker’s goal, right on the margin of offside when the ball came back off the bar.“He was unlucky, the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from him and he had another chance as well, so he could have had a few goals.“Lawrence is a goalscorer, he has impressed working with the group and I am pleased he has got a goal on his debut, and not the only one – Stuart Findlay got a goal on his debut, which is great for Stuart.”The newcomers were upstaged by John McGinn, who netted a first-half hat-trick.The Aston Villa midfielder now has seven goals for the season, four of them for his country.“He’s a goalscorer, he has shown that in the English Premier League,” Clarke said.“If you can score goals at that level, you can score goals at any level.“They have found a really good way of playing John at Aston Villa, where he is always up supporting the striker and getting on the end of second balls in and around the box.”Meanwhile, Stuart Findlay hailed the comprehensive - victory over San Marino as the “peak of my career so far” after he marked his first cap with a goal and an assist.After setting up McGinn’s third goal with a firm downward header at the end of the first half, the Kilmarnock centre-back got on the scoresheet himself when he nodded in Ryan Christie’s corner to put Scotland - up.Findlay – the first Kilmarnock player to score for Scotland since  – said netting on his international debut at Hampden Park was a childhood dream.“It’s an amazing feeling for myself,” the -year-old said.“It’s probably the peak of my career so far. To score on my debut at Hampden is something I’ve dreamt of as a little boy so it’s a really special moment for me.“I’ve looked up and seen my mum and dad in the stand for the national anthem and that’s a moment I’ve been able to savour forever.“But the most important thing was we knew we had a game to play and I know it’s a game we’re expected to win. But to go out, score six goals and keep a clean sheet – we’ve done what was expected and, hopefully, we can kick-start our form from here.”A first-half hat-trick from Villa midfielder McGinn had put Scotland - up at the break, while there were also goals for substitute Stuart Armstrong and home debutant Shankland in the second half of the Euro  qualying Group I fixture.Findlay said it was a special night for both him and Dundee United striker Shankland, who he has known since childhood.He added: “I’ve known Lawrence from when we were little boys, we used to play against each other aged eight and nine so I’ve known him all the way through.“I was over the moon to see him score and then to get one myself was a really special moment for the two of us.“We might not have been involved at this level not very long so it just shows you how quickly football can turn and I’m delighted for Lawrence.“Just to get your first cap anywhere is incredible but to do it at Hampden is just something you dream of when you’re growing up and it’s something I’ll always remember.”The victory saw Scotland move up one place in Group I, above Kazakhstan to within a point of third-placed Cyprus with two matches remaining.Clarke’s side face that pair next month."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

It’s not like a formal job interview so participants learn how to tackle face-to-face conversations without feeling pressure.“I start by asking them what they want to achieve, and the response can be anything from ‘I want a job in this particular field’ to ‘I want to improve my CV’. Then we see how we can best help. We can either suggest something that can improve their employment prospects or signpost them to someone  who can.”Barnardo’s can enrol people on to schemes such as the Barnardo’s Works Best programme, in which participants earn qualications, gain work experience, try volunteering and add handy skills to their CV, such as first aid.On the day, one of the participants who wants to be a mechanic applied to join the Army.Regimental support worker Phil Carradice said: “It has been really beneficial for us to attend and we feel that we’re able to tell young people about everything the Army officers do in a comfortable setting.“For example,someone is looking to become a mechanic, we can offer training where people are paid more than £, and that rises to £, after it finishes.“Joining the Armed Forces opens up a whole world and people broaden their horizons, and they can move on to pastures new in four years and apply the skills they have learned in a related field.”Callum Boyle was one of those who took part in the workshop.The -year-old, of Kintore, said: “I am really glad I came along, it’s been really interesting to meet people from dferent organisations.“I would like an apprenticeship in admin work so I can work in an office. I’m not sure what I want to do beyond that but today has given me more ideas to think about.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.43207371-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.43207371-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.43207371-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.43207371-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"charlie house thanks aberdeen public for charity cafe support","story":"A children#s charity has praised the “overwhelming support” it has received for its ReCHarge Cafe.Charlie House, which supports children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions, opened the eatery in the Bon Accord centre in April.All profits from the venture go towards its Big Build Appeal, an £ million specialist support centre that will be located at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising at Charlie House, said: “We can’t believe it has been six months since we first opened the doors at ReCHarge Cafe.“We have been overwhelmed with the support from the people of the north-east and would like to thank each and every customer whose snack, tea break or lunch purchase has gone on to support local families.“Every penny of profit supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions, and their families in the north-east of Scotland.”The cafe has benefited from a range of dferent businesses across the city supporting the venture.How you can donate to Charlie House#s Big Build Appeal\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local how-you-can-donate-to-charlie-houses-big-build-appeal embed # secretWNcnUfbxmK\" data-secret\"WNcnUfbxmK\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"It runs on a pay-what- you-want service based on what customers believe refreshments are worth and has been fitted out with a range of dferent facilities.It also has an accessible toilet, complete with a hoist, so families with children of any age can comfortably use the equipment.Susan added: “We could not have progressed with this project without the unwavering support of the Bon Accord team – from management to operations and facilities, the team have been incredible.“We also have to highlight the amazing local businesses which have supported us – from kitchen fitters to flooring companies to signage and local painters and decorators.“These incredible organisations have gted us over £, worth of services – this has included gts in kind and man hours.“A final and special thanks must go out to our regular volunteers who work with the staff at the cafe, some committing several days a week, to support the cafe and its customers.“We look forward to serving many more customers.”CHARLIE House is hoping to raise £ million for its Big Build Appeal to construct and maintain a specialist support centre.A whopping £m of the funds has already been secured through generous supporters.Now a public fundraising campaign has been launched, to which you can donate to help Charlie House’s vision become a reality.Visit bit.ly ROBktF or call  ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da549d74db097.19845128-423x564.jpg ","title":"india ms treatment gives north east mum chance have life again","story":"A multiple sclerosis sufferer today said she has the chance to “have a le again” after receiving treatment in India.Maggie Conner’s family put all their efforts into raising cash so the mum-of-two could receive stem cell treatment in a bid to stop the rapid progression of her MS.The -year-old had been due to travel to Mexico to undergo the potentially le-changing treatment but it was proving too expensive, at a cost of around , .Instead, the family looked to India, with Maggie travelling to a bone marrow transplant unit in New Delhi in August and ing last month, after receiving  days of treatment.She said: “I was due to go to Mexico but I couldn’t afford it.“It cost , to get the treatment in India so it was drastically cheaper.“My mum, Louise, came with me for emotional support.“It was my only hope to stop the MS.”The process involves the removal of stem cells from the bone marrow which are then treated and stored. vw, px\"  In the meantime, patients have chemotherapy to kill off the immune system, then the treated cells are reintroduced with the aim that the body will regenerate a new immune system.Maggie, who is married to Paul, , and mum to daughters Megan, , and Leah, , had to leave her family behind for the duration of her trip and was confined to her hospital room while she went through treatment.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant.

As ldquoDowning Street sourcesrsquorsquo release briefing and counter-briefing ndash often contrary to Government policy ndash the effect is a dizzying upending of reality.Will they do what they say they will, and do they even want to As we pin our hopes on the wisdom of our elected representatives while also doubting their intentions, the cracks in the pillars of our democracy worsen.It looks a lot like the rules have changed, and that the conventions that previously governed the honesty of politics have been gradually eroded.One politician who has emerged relatively unscathed from the Brexit process thus far is Nicola Sturgeon. Ironically, her greatest political challenges at present come not from the electorate, but from critics within her own party.There is internal stre over her approach to a second independence referendum, tensions which have been exasperated with every juddering lurch of the Brexit crisis. The constant ticking of the countdown clock, as we have edged nearer to each deadline in the Article  process, has ramped up the disgruntlement and impatience within the SNP.As Ms Sturgeon took to the airwaves for a mammoth media round on the second day of SNP conference on Monday, she set out her short and long-term priorities on Brexit and independence.She wants to see Boris Johnson fulfil the obligations placed upon him by the Benn Act to request a three-month extensionParliament hasnrsquot passed his deal ndash or given its support for no-deal ndash by October . It is her hope that the opposition parties will manage to get their act together and that a General Election will follow soon after.She also confirmed that indyref will be ldquofront and centrersquorsquo in the SNPrsquos campaign in the upcoming General Election. With the SNP projected to win the most seats in Scotland, she hopes the momentum is with her party to negotiate over holding another vote.Her strategy relies on Labour forming a minority government with the support of opposition parties. The price of the SNPrsquos support will be for prime minister Jeremy Corbyn to grant a Section  order so a referendum can be held.However, there is a widespread expectation that any such request would be refused, either by an emboldened Mr Johnson ed as prime minister with a majority ndash or a witless Mr Corbyn who refuses to give ground to earn the SNPrsquos support. If that scenario materialises, the undercurrent of party dissent could threaten to burst its banks.:Andy Maciver: Scottish independence is inevitable  Im not so sureA ldquoPlan B to counteract this, supported by SNP councillor Chris McEleny and others, would see a pro-independence majority at the next election being taken as a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK government.Ms Sturgeon holds no truck for this muddy proposal, or indeed any deviation from the ldquogold-standardrsquorsquo route to independence that was pursued in . In one interview recently she pointed out that the Westminster voting system makes it possible for the SNP to win the most seats in Scotland, but on a minority of votes. In an age of relentless spin and endless loophole-searching to rig the system, her candour was refreshing.Lets not forget the catalyst for the runaway train of crisis we have seen since  was a leader ndash in David Cameron ndash who bowed to pressure from a minority in his party to seek an answer to a question that, at the time, very few were asking.It is easy to see why the naturally-cautious Ms Sturgeon would want to avoid the legal and constitutional headache that Plan B would bring.She believes that the knee-jerk refusal from Unionist parties to allow a second independence referendum is untenable and that it would be a democratic outrage for Westminster parties of any colour to deny Scotland the right to have a say on its future. While compelling, this argument does rely heavily on the politics of yesteryear: where manesto commitments and election victories meant something, and political reality had an impact on events. In the Brexit Britain of today, it is unlikely that a desire to be ndash or be seen to be ndash fair and reasonable will be enough to compel Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn to concede to the SNPrsquos demands.But Ms Sturgeon is an experienced political operator and it is inconceivable that she will not have planned for that eventuality. Perhaps too quietly for some, perhaps in too guarded a manner to quell the disquiet from her party, but she will have planned nonetheless.:Nicola Sturgeon in row over unofficial email accountGiven that, it would have been wise of her critics to wait at least until that key moment before declaring that they had lost faith in her ability to secure a second referendum.If some in the SNP got their way, theyrsquod have her abandon moderation and diplomacy during the Brexit crisis. After all, Mr Johnson fights dirty, so why shouldnrsquot she Some may see her unwillingness to play the game under the new, gloves-off, Brexit rules as weakness. Others now question whether she really wants independence at all. In doing so they undermine one of their partyrsquos greatest assets ndash a leader who hasnrsquot lost a sense of perspective and public duty.You get the sense that a chunk of SNP supporters long for the bombastic days of Alex Salmond, believing that in the current political climate, bullishness and bul***t is power. They should be careful what they wish for.When the time comes for Scotland to decide its future, voters will be asked to put their trust in the arguments made by politicians. Having a leader who still plays by the rules and isnrsquot prone to party-political flights of fancy will be an asset for the campaign.For that reason, MsSturgeonrsquos critics should be wary of deciding that their captain is a dud or declaring the game over before it has even begun."},{"url":null,"title":"nail-bars-car-washes-consumers-must-not-ignore-modern-slavery","story":"Irsquom sure there are people who enjoy the chore - the routine of it, the pride in the finished result, care given to their pride-and-joy vehicle. No thanks.Why find space in onersquos busy schedule for hard labour when for a mere pound. you can have five men clean your car til its glinting Well, becauseit seems too good to be true then itrsquos likely to be too good to be true.More likely, a pound. car wash means those five people are being exploited as cheap labour. Possibly they are victims of modern slavery, perhaps they have been trafficked.But, given the proleration of hand car washes and the queues at them daily - and nightly, many of the car washes are open long hours - this fact is obviously easy enough for people to turn a blind eye to.Itrsquos interesting that modern day slavery has entered the public consciousness with regards to the clothing industry. We know quite well that our cheap clothes - the pound. swimsuit, the pound pair of jeans - come at a price that is far from economic. There is shock when big name, reputable brands are found to be churning out clothes in factories where workers are paid p an hour to toil in squalid conditions.Boycott, comes the cry.Just yesterday an exposeacute in thenewspaper alleged that workers in a factory making clothing for the high end active wear brand Lululemon are being subjected to cruel treatment - beatings, verbal abuse and pressure to work overtime. They are paid, it is claimed, around pound a month, which is less than the cost of one pair of Lululemon leggings.The company has said it will launch an immediate investigation, no doubt acting swtly and sharply because it knows the gross ill treatment of Bangladeshi female factory workers will play extremely badly with its middle class, socially aware customer base. Will boycott become the cry for Lululemon Yet when poor working conditions exist on our doorstep, we somehow find it easier to overlook.Nail bars are another consumer convenience where modern day slavery prolerates. They satisfy the desire for a bargain, make you feel good and therersquos no inconvenience of having to book ahead for an appointment. In the current financial climate, women have less money to spend on beauty treats and so something like a regular manicure is an addictive temptation for some.But is it ethical to continue to go to a nail baryou believe you may be participating in exploitation  Itrsquos easy for me to ask: the one and only time Irsquove set foot in a nail bar was accompanying a Police Scotland operation on human trafficking. If I was a woman keen on regular manicures and pedicures, would I be, as with the car washes, uncomfortable but still settling down for a file and polish The restructuring of how we shop has created an environment in which it is easy for exploitation to go unchecked. As with nail bars satisfying the need for a quick, cheap treatment, petrol stations are under pressure as consumers find it more convenient to fill up at supermarket petrol pumps rather than make two journeys to two locations.This means a decrease in the number of mechanical car washes and an increase in vacant space to be taken over by... exploitative hand car washes. Which is not to say that all car washes are exploitative. The UK body the Car Wash Advisory Service has an accreditation scheme, WashMark, that drivers can look out for.Drivers and nail bar customers can also easily look out for the signs of exploitation: workers who canrsquot communicate with customers in English, where the staff appear withdrawn or very young, where they are living in houses of multiple occupancy.A high profile court case last week saw four members of a gang found guilty of trafficking young Roma women and girls from Slovakia to Govanhill, to flats just a couple of streets away from where I live. One of the young women was sold into a sham marriage for pound, outside a branch of Primark in Glasgow city centre. The story captured readers in high numbers, likely from the shock of having such a heinous crime against such a familiar background.Yet exploitation is happening all around us and it needs consumers to be alert to the issue in order to tackle it.The Scottish Government commissioned a public survey this year on public responses to human trafficking. It found that respondents saw the crime as less of an issue in Scotland than overseas. In ,  per cent of people saw modern slavery as an issue in Scotland, falling to  per cent this year.People were far more likely to believe modern slavery to be an issue in Europe and the rest of the world - showing an awareness of the subject but a belief that it doesnrsquot happen here. Some  per cent of respondents admitted to a low level of understanding of human trafficking.At an event a few years ago I was chatting to a chap who said he owned a handful of car washes at dferent locations in the west of Scotland. He was quite confident in the ethics of his working practice, saying all his staff earned pound for a  hour day and were given a hot meal at lunchtime.The justication he gave to me was the men he employed would otherwise be out of work. With little English, no qualications and no support networks in Scotland, they would be destitute. He saw exploitation as, in fact, a gt to his staff, a generous springboard into a better le.That was the last time I visited the hand car wash.

For that reason, it may be easy to dismiss the use of the word lsquoinevitablersquo.But I wouldnrsquot. Its users may very well be correct.

Bluntly, more newly minted -year-old voters vote yes, and more dying voters vote no.So, the feeling of inevitability amongst the SNP hierarchy - and note that it is they who are pushing this rather than lsquoordinaryrsquo members - looks like it has a solid ballast.

There is another side to this story, and it remains to be seen whether the lurking risks for the yes campaign have been fully baked into their thinking.At the centre of this is the weekend poll showing unionist:nationalist sentiment at :. This was lauded as a breakthrough the first time a Panelbase poll has recorded such success. It is progress - of that there can be absolutely no doubt. But I am not at all convinced that it is enough. It was not so long ago that ostensibly senior people were briefing the media that they considered % pro-independence polling to be the point at which it was safe to agitate for another referendum. They talked of the stars aligningBrexit turned into a quagmireandBoris Johnson became Prime Minister . How many more stars do they need I see a requirement, from the nationalistsrsquo perspective, for the polling to be signicantly higher, because those lurking risks are real, and they provide a very competitive counterweight to the demographic idend.:SNP to scrap council fees for at home careDespite the polling indicating a perceived stronger economic future inside the EU than inside the UK, it remains a moot point whether economics will again be the Achilles Heel of the Yes campaign. It cannot be downplayed - the fiscal deficit is dismal, the currency question is further spiced by the inevitable debate over whether or not Scotland will have to join the Euro, and the Green-inspired drt to the left is creating an electorally worrying gap between personal tax rates north and south of the border, a gap which is only likely to expand.Other signicant drivers of voter behaviour will undoubtedly be more prevalent this time around. Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable. By the time the next referendum comes around, we will have had another two national elections and, presumably, a formal exit from the EU.Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen. We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, on Andrew Marr on Sunday, invoked EFTA as a short-term post-Brexit solution.

It is farming but done with such a degree of technical sophistication that the pioneers would scarcely recognise it.But those early farmers would undoubtedly relish the extraordinarily good position that Scotland is now in,  years after they made those first tentative steps.They knew aquaculture was the future back then and it is even more the future now.:Demand for farmed salmon is causing an ecological disasterAlready more than half the fish eaten across the globe is farmed. By , that percentage has to rise to  per centwe are going to feed the world.And here we are in Scotland with a thriving, buoyant fish farming sector which is recognised as being at the very top of the world order.We have the coastline for farm-raised salmon, we have the water and we have the farming expertise. We have some of the toughest regulations anywhere and world-leading certication and auditing schemes.Everything is in place, you would think, for Scotland to take advantage of the growing demand for lean, healthy protein and for salmon to assume the central role in the economy that it does in somewhere like Norway.And yet, and yet hellip.There are still those who would do salmon farming down.Some of this is driven by prejudice, some by misinformation and some by myths which are based on  impressions of a farming sector from  or  years ago.Just take the issue of fish feed. Back in the s,  per cent of salmon feed was made of fish oil and fish meal.By  this had dropped to  per cent and it is predicted to drop to just  per cent in the next few years.Salmon farmers are using less and less fish in their feed as other, plant-based ingredients come on the market.And even the fish that is being used as an ingredient in the feed is coming from dferent, more sustainable sources.BACKGROUND:Fears revealed for food supply as Chinese fishmeal industry boomsThe main producers of feed for Scottish salmon now use trimmings from fish processing ndash unsuitable human consumption - to make up almost a third of fish content.Our farmers do not use feed which has ingredients from non-sustainable sources like India, Vietnam or The Gambia and they are proud of this record.Then therersquos the issue of medicines.Over the ten years to , medicine use dropped by nearly halfto its lowest level for a decade.Much of that is because farmers are using new and dferent treatments for sea lice ndash like cleanerfish, the wrasse and the lumpfish that eat the lice off the salmon in their pens.It has taken time but our farmers have now managed to close the breeding cycle and will soon be able to hatch, rear and grow their own cleanerfish, rather than take them from the wild.Salmon have the best conversion rate for feed to meat of any similar livestock. It takes about .kg of feed to produce kg of salmon, an extraordinary rate which is why the United Nations believes aquaculture really is the way to feed the world of tomorrow.Those camera feeds from the pens to the control barge help this process too. They ensure just the right amount of feed is delivered to the salmon at exactly the right time.Wasted feed which drops to the sea floor is no good to anyone which is why such strenuous efforts have been made cutting it back, efforts which mean that just g in every tonne, or just . per cent, is now wasted.And this raises a wider but crucial point: farmers want to protect the environment and this includes making sure there is as little waste as possible.It is the cold, clear, pristine waters of the Atlantic which produce such great Scottish salmon so farmers are working hard to make sure they stay that way.Scotlandrsquos farm-raised salmon have a good environmental story to tell. It is a story of top-quality feed, sourced from sustainable sources, of the lowest lice levels for six years, controlled largely by natural methods which have helped reduce medicine use to extraordinarily low levels.But it is also a story about Scotland not just playing its part in a global food revolution but leading it too.Solutions and technologies tried out here which will be used in aquaculture across the developing world in the future. Every step we take in making our sector more sustainable and efficient will be taken on a hundredfold where.This is the future: so we really can start feeding the world - from here, from Scotland.Hamish Macdonell is Director of Strategic Engagement for the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-im-not-complaining-not-nicolas-best-mate","story":"Joanna Cherry QC revealed she had only ever had one sit-down talk with the current First Minister despite being being an MP since .The Scottish Tories said it showed \"sour\" relations at the top of the party.Ms Cherry also said she had only received a single text of congratulations from Ms Sturgeon over her recent legal wins on Brexit and the unlawful prorogation of Westminster.ldquoIrsquom not complaining that Irsquom not Nicolarsquos best mate, she told Holyrood magazine, addingthe First Minister had a country to run.:Historic court defeat for Boris JohnsonHowever the Edinburgh South West MP said she was a good friend of Alex Salmond, calling him ldquothe greatest leader the partyrsquos ever had.Referring to former First Ministerrsquos impending criminal trial, she said she was worried about the ldquopolitical fall-out for the party.She said: ldquoAlex is my friend, and I was brought up to stand by my friends.

Itrsquos ridiculous.ldquoIrsquom at Westminster, the leader of the SNP must be at Holyrood, because they must be capable of being First Minister, and I have never said I want to be party leader others have said it and frankly, I wish they wouldnrsquot, because it just causes me grief I could do without.However, she did not deny that she would want the position.She said: ldquoSome people think Irsquove got a big ego, because I donrsquot say, lsquoOh no, it couldnrsquot possibly be little old mersquo.ldquoThat is what women are expected to do, butI was a man of my age, with my professional background, people would take it for granted that I might want a leadership role, and I certainly wouldnrsquot have to apologise for it.ldquoSo, what Irsquom saying is, I wouldnrsquot rule myself out for the future, but there is no leadership vacancy right now and Irsquom not putting myself forward as a potential leader of the SNP at the moment.ldquoThose who are doing so are mentioning my name without my involvement or my permission.Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoItrsquos clear relations at the top of the SNP are turning sour.ldquoPerhaps itrsquos no wonder Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want to give the time of day to an MP whorsquos so blatantly pitching for her job."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10546918.jpg?type=article-full","title":"opinion-matrix-queen-become-political-pawn","story":"The IndependentIts leader accused the Prime Minister of embroiling the Queen into a party political charade which the palace ought not to have agreed to.It said the nation was presented with  bills, few of which will see their way onto the statute books during what is left of this parliament and \"relatively few of them deserve to\".\"Just as well, then, that in a few weeks time this Queens Speech may be replaced by another one from a dferent prime minister or a dferent party,\" the leader said. \"For the piece of legislation most urgently required is the only one that can end the Brexit trauma with a full democratic mandate: a Referendum Bill that will put the Johnson dealor a no-deal Brexit to the people, with the option to Remain in the EU.\"More and more MPs are reluctantly bowing to the logic that a general election is the wrong question: like this Queens Speech, it would be an utterly futile affair.\"The Daily The centre-right daily broadsheet accepted that the Queens Speech laid out an agenda designed to win an election - saying that it was conceivable that the monarch had opened the shortest parliamentary session since September .

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amCalMac Ferries are challenging Transport Scotland on its decision to award the Northern Isles ferry contract to competitor Serco Ltd.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is the critical spine that will bring wider transport improvements like Northern Powerhouse Rail and the Midlands Rail Hub to le.Northern leaders have also published a review recommending that the North and Midlands must take control of plans for a high-speed rail network in their areas.The Northern Powerhouse Independent Review called for the establishment of a body named HS North, which would be armrsquos- from government and be overseen by Transport for the North to ensure HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail are combined efficiently.Chris Oglesby, chief executive of Manchester-based property firm Bruntwood and a member of the  which oversaw the review, said: ldquoOur review  proposes that the North and Midlands must take control of the nationrsquos high-speed network.ldquoHS and Northern Powerhouse Rail ndash a major priority of Boris Johnson and his Government ndash are completely interlinked and a joined up approach is required to both and the upgrades to existing lines. ldquoOnly by delivering an integrated high-speed network right across the North can a Northern Powerhouse vision be truly realised.

However, I was shocked to hear that Easyjet would not permit me to travel. Instead, I was advised to go to my ‘embassy’. I explained that I was a UK citizen and, hence, had no embassy in London. The customer services person then told me to go to the passport office – even though I had not lost my passport.”Desperate to catch her flight home, Dr Ruxton visited the passport office as instructed, despite the fact her passport had been left safely at home in Scotland.Read more: Easyjet founder claims victory in ‘Easy’ name battle with ChinaShe said: “As predicted, they told me that, since I had not lost my passport and needed no ID toto Scotland, they could do nothing for me. I even tried to contact DVLA to obtain another driving licence but was told that I had to apply online and it would take a week to arrive - at my home address.”AdviceEasyJet’s customer service team repeatedly told Dr Ruxton that customers are always advised to “validate their travel documents with the local embassy” and that she had needed to obtain an emergency travel document from consular staff - despite her telling them that she was a British citizen and was in the UK.She was forced to borrow money from a work colleague living in London and bought a rail fare to Scotland - at a cost of £.After directly contacting Easyjet’s head of customer relations, John Leighton, via LinkedIn on her , the customer service team eventually offered Dr Ruxton a £ voucher, but reiterated that she should have visited her embassy in London - and had refused to follow their advice.Dr Ruxton said: “I declined the voucher. All I want is for them to say ‘Sorry for giving you the wrong advice’ and refund me the £ I had to pay out for my train fare.“The Easyjet ‘line to take’ – that a UK citizen living in Scotland who has been a victim of crime should have to go to an embassy to prove their identity in order to get home – displays a worrying lack of understanding about the nature of the United Kingdom and a lack of care for customers.”Read more: These are the companies which have been rated the worst for customer serviceThe UK Government confirmed that there was no British Embassy in London for British citizens.A spokesman for EasyJet said: \"We are sorry that Mrs Ruxton and her daughter were unable to travel on their flight on  July and were incorrectly informed, as a UK citizen, to contact the embassy. \"It was correct, however, that photo ID is required as they had hold luggage and so this is required for safety reasons. This meant the documentation she had was not sufficient to be able to travel.

Personal attacks on opponents, third-rate jokes, laboured puns, and extravagant claims of future success are all fair game in the conference hall, likely to provoke an enthusiastic response from starry-eyed, ultra-loyal, party activists, many nursing hangovers from the previous night’s festivities.It is in this context that we should view Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s comments to the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Monday, specically his claim that the economic case for independence is “stronger than ever”. Scotland can “more than afford to be independent”, Mr Mackay told SNP delegates.The timing of the Finance Secretary’s comments was somewhat unfortunate, coming out on the very morning that the latest Royal Bank of Scotland PMI report showed that manufacturing firms in Scotland had suffered a sharp drop in output last month, and a steeper decline in new orders. Scotland ranked only above Northern Ireland in parts of the United Kingdom in terms of business confidence, trailing behind the UK average.: Queen’s Speech rejects call to repeat ‘once in a generation’ independence vote: Poll: Support for Scottish independence hits %It is not just on this measure that the Scottish economy is underperforming, after  years of SNP Government. We are in a decade of below average economic growth, with unemployment rates in Scotland higher than the UK average, and employment rates signicantly lower. On one estimate, there are some , more adults of working age in Scotland economically inactive compared to the UK average. Their participation in the workforce would provide a signicant boost to the Scottish economy, not to mention a considerable contribution towards income tax revenues.Independence miracle unlikelyNotwithstanding the SNP’s disappointing track record on economic issues, we are now expected to believe that independence will see a miraculous improvement not just in economic performance, but in our fiscal position. How, exactly, this is likely to come about remains a mystery. The Scottish Government’s own figures told us in August that we run a nominal annual deficit of £.bn, representing seven per cent of Scotland’s GDP. This translates into a Union Dividend of just short of £, for every man, woman and child in Scotland. It is this level of fiscal transfer from other parts of the UK that supports higher levels of public spending here, and these funds would require to be replaced in the event of separationwe were not to see dramatic tax hikes, swingeing public service cuts, or a combination of both.We are still no clearer what exactly the SNP would do to fill Scotland’s fiscal gap post-independence, beyond vague promises about the need to “grow the economy”. At least the  White Paper had one policy proposal which might have driven forward economic growth: the promise to cut corporation tax by three per cent below the UK rate. But even that has now been ditched.SNP politicians will talk about how Scexit will allow Scotland to pursue a more liberal immigration policy, with a growing population driving economic expansion. Scotland’s track record in this area, after  years of SNP Government, gives little cause to be optimistic on that particular front.Woeful lack of planningDespite having free movement of people within the EU for decades, levels of inward migration to Scotland have been lower than average for the UK as a whole. What exactly would reverse this trend and attract more European immigrants to Scotland in the future – with higher taxes than the rest of the UK and with all the economic uncertainties around independence – is far from clear.It is not just on the question of fiscal balances that the SNP’s economic prospectus is threadbare. We are still no clearer as to what exactly the currency of an independent Scotland would be, but the preference now seems to be for ditching the pound sterling and adopting an alternative, presenting clear challenges for Scottish businesses trading with the rest of the UK.Moreover, at the weekend Nicola Sturgeon refused to rule out the prospect of a hard border between the Solway and Tweed in the event of Scexit, again presenting huge challenges for Scottish business. The UK domestic market is worth three times more to Scottish exporters than the value of the EU Single Market, yet the SNP, in an exercise in economic absurdity, wants to prioritise the latter over the former.Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that whilst Scottish businesses whom I speak to on a regular basis may have their concerns about a no-deal Brexit, by far their greater concern is the prospect of independence – with a dferent currency, a hard border, a massive fiscal deficit, and a woeful lack of any long-term plan.If Brexit tells us anything, it is that extracting ourselves from a -year-old economic union is more complex than anyone first imagined. On any logical basis, dissolving a -year-old economic, social and political union will be many times more problematic.The fact is that the economic case for the Union is stronger than ever. Despite all the noise coming out of the SNP conference at Aberdeen this week, there is no evidence that that situation is about to change any time soon.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

The idea that we need a compulsory voter ID system to prevent fraud is like saying we need a new law against hunting unicorns. It is a solution to a problem that does not exist.#Still worse, the so-called solution creates a new problem, by harming our democratic rights.“Not everyone has a passport or drivers’ licence and elderly voters especially will not appreciate the complication that this would add to what should be a simple act of civic engagement.”He argued that the high turnout in August#s Holyrood by-election showed that the community valued its democratic rights and there was no need for a voter ID scheme.“We should continue to encourage higher voting rates, not throw obstacles in the way. The government should think again.”Chief executive of the Electoral Reform SocietyDarren Hughes is among critics of the #electoral integrity# proposals that would require voters to show photographic ID at polling stations. Those without a passport or drivers# licence would be able to apply for a free #local electoral identity document#.But Mr Hughes said: #When millions of people lack ID, these mooted plans risk raising the drawbridge to huge numbers of marginalised voters – including many elderly and BAME [black and minority ethnic] voters.#The ERS estimates the scheme would cost £m at each national election and Mr Hughes believes there are bigger threats to democracy that should be tackled first.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous #dark ads#, dodgy donations and disinformation. Instead of taking on the real issue, they are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.#Make no mistake – these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless. Ministers should focus on combating the real threats to our democracy, rather than suppressing voters’ rights. raquoI am shocked! Yes, shocked! By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud.

Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dup defends its position as rivals claim its been suckered in brexit talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thats going to be the starting point going forward.\"It is a ridiculous position to have been placed into, and it shows the total ineptitude of the DUPs so-called negotiating position over the last three years.\"Mr Allister told yesterdays Radio Ulster Nolan Show that the DUP had been \"foolish\" by shting its position on a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which had resulted it in being \"shafted\" by the Government.He told the Belfastthe removal of the \"unionist veto\" would have serious implications for Northern Irelands constitutional future in the UK.\"It is becoming clearer that the DUP were sucked into agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea with the promise of a unionist veto - and once they were sucked in, they are to be shafted,\" Mr Allister said. \"If the unionist veto is to go,there is to be a customs border as well as a regulatory border, and we are to be put in captivity in the EU and removed essentially from the UK economy and put in the orbit of the economy of the Republic - then it is very serious for the future of the Union,\" he continued.Mr Allister called on the DUP to \"disavow\" the regulatory border in the Irish sea, and take a \"step back\".But Sir Jeffrey branded the remarks as unhelpful at a time when unity between unionists is called for.\"This is a time when unionist parties with common ground on Brexit should be working together rather than attacking each other,\" he told the Belfast . \"The DUP has led from the front on Brexit whilst others have remained on the sidelines.\"It is deeply disappointing that some fellow unionists are peddling nonsense against the DUP based on media speculation. \"We want to see a sensible and balanced negotiated agreement as we leave the EU, but arrangements that create barriers to trade in the Irish Sea would not be supported by us,\" Sir Jeffrey added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\".

Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland.

The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters. Thus giving a timely lt to a party languishing in the polls in the Republic.The campaign to have a border poll will also stallJohnsons government can pull off the elusive deal.However, the idea of a bespoke NI referendum on the customs union or back stop is a real possibility. That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive. The question is, will they In the meantime, remember For the less you say, the less you hear andanyone asks who told you, then Please dont mention me!"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures standoff between fox and marmot wins top photography prize","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Seen as a middle-of-the-road Leaver, he replaced Dominic Raab in the role when he resigned from Theresa May’s cabinet over the terms of her Withdrawal Agreement.But Mr Barclay was kept in the post by Mr Johnson during his drastic reshuffle after taking the reins of the Tory party and was given a more beefed up role in terms of the negotiations.He has held regular meetings with key players across the continent, sounding them out for any way to a deal. Mr Barclay maintained on Tuesday that “a deal is still very possible”.– Michel BarnierI have just debriefed EU Ministers in Luxembourg. 🇪🇺 unity remains strong. We want an agreement that works for everybody: the whole #UK  whole #EU. On route back to Brussels to take stock w  my colleagues. Talks are dficult but I believe an agreement is still possible. pic FxQHCajgb— Michel BarnierOctober , Heralded for the way he has kept the other EU members united around a Brexit position, the EU’s chief negotiator has been involved at every step of the way since being appointed by the European Commission to lead the Brexit talks.The -year-old’s office is one of the first stop-offs for UK MPs when they visit Brussels to discuss the orce terms progress.The Frenchman has called on the Prime Minister to produce a legal texthe is to secure a deal at this week’s European Council.– Leo Varadkar\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar Since taking the reins in Dublin in May , the Irish prime minister has become a major character in the Brexit saga and unequivocal about the need to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Seen as one of the main power brokers in the talks, Mr Varadkar is being looked to by the EU to judge whether the Downing Street proposals for Northern Ireland after Brexit are passable.Mr Johnson’s initial “two borders” pitch for a deal – that wanted to take Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union, in a move that would have meant checks at vicinities around the Republic of Ireland and in the six counties – was given short shrt by Mr Varadkar.But it was a meeting between the pair of leaders at a luxury hotel on the Wirral last week that gave Brexit addicts one of their most memorable moments.Following a walk through the wedding venue grounds, they agreed there was a “pathway” to a deal, setting into motion a new urgency on both sides of the Channel to secure an agreement.– David FrostThe so-called Brexit sherpa, he is Mr Johnson’s most trusted aides when it comes to delivering his Brexit message and working out how Britain can leave by October .He replaced Theresa May’s Brexit man Olly Robbins, who was often portrayed as a villain by Eurosceptics for his handling of the talks.A man who, in all likelihood, knows the Eurostar check-in regime better than the back of his hand, he has spent more nights in Brussels hotels than in his own home in recent weeks.A former special adviser to the PM when he was foreign secretary, he was locked in fierce talks during the weekend, along with his -strong team, after last week’s breakthrough meeting with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar.When it comes to the latest Brexit developments, he is the man in the know.– Arlene Foster\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP leader Arlene Foster Unlike during Mrs May’s reign, Mrs Foster’s DUP party could be interpreted as having a less crucial role because it no longer props up a fragile majority after Mr Johnson lost his Commons advantage.But Ms Foster and Nigel Dodds, her deputy and Westminster leader, are still seen as key in Downing Street and have been granted audiences with the PM at Number  twice in as many days.The reality is Mr Johnson would need the backing of every MP he could get to shepherd any deal through the Commons, and the DUP wield influence over the European Research Groupof hardline Tory Brexiteers.Mrs Foster’s outfit has been approving recently, it remains to be seen how Mr Johnson will accommodate the EU’s demands for no checks on the border and ensuring the integrity of the single market, while also placating the DUP’s demands not to have checks in the Irish sea on goods travelling between NI and Great Britain.– Angela Merkel\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Berlin The German Chancellor may face political instability at home, but in Brussels, her opinion is said to still be the one that matters most.In the summer, Brexit hit the headlines again after she outlined a -day window for Mr Johnson to put his proposals before leaders in a bid to put some rigour into the talks.Mrs May was seen to cosy up to Ms Merkel when looking to push a deal through and Mr Johnson will have to make similar overtureshe wants to travel back to London on Friday with all  signatures on a Withdrawal Agreement.– Emmanuel MacronThe French president was the second EU leader Mr Johnson chose to visit in the summer, following his trip to Berlin, and he is a respected voice in the council.Mr Macron has taken a tougher line on whether Britain should be granted any further extensions but, with his domestic polling taking a dip, some commentators see his approach to Brexit as playing to French voters.The PM spent “ minutes or so” on the phone to his counterpart in Paris on Tuesday – proof of his influence and the need to have him on side before leaders convene in Brussels.– Jean-Claude Juncker\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Prime Minister Boris Johnson with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker It speaks volumes about the importance of Mr Juncker’s role as president of the European Commission that some Brussels-based media were more interested in the election of his successor than the Brexit process this autumn.Boss to Mr Barnier, the outgoing leader is one of those Mr Johnson will have to satisfy in order to get a deal. The pair lunched together last month, enjoying courses of snails and salmon, so they are no strangers.Mr Juncker has made it clear he would approve an extension to the Brexit negotiationsthe UK requested one.– Donald TuskBack in Paris for a discussion with @EmmanuelMacron of Brexit, Syria, Turkey and enlargement before #EUCO this week. pic dMxjeSCMi— Donald TuskOctober , The European Council president is in charge of putting together the agenda for when the leaders of the  member countries meet four times a year.The former Polish prime minister is the go-between when it comes to liaising with European leaders.He has previously accused the former mayor of London of playing a “stupid blame game” when it comes to pitting the EU against Britain.It awaits to be seen whether he deems that sufficient progress has been made on doing a deal to put it on the agenda for Thursday and Friday’s summit in Brussels.There is also talk of having to approach Mr Tusk about organising an emergency summit for later in the monththe I’s and T’s are not dotted and crossed yet on the Withdrawal Agreement.– Tim BarrowA well-travelled diplomat, Mr Barrow took over as permanent representative of the UK to the EU following Sir Ivan Rodgers resignation in January .He represents the soft arm of the negotiations, feeding information back to Downing Street on his discussions with EU officials and other diplomats from member states in between the crunch points.Mr Barrow was the official who handed over Mrs May’s letter triggering Article  and he will be by the PM’s side while in Brussels for the European Council summit.– Guy Verhofstadt\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Guy Verhofstadt pictured at the Liberal Democrats conference Another EU power player, the Belgian MEP is the Brexit co-ordinator for the European Parliament.Deeply committed to the European project and the only one out of Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker to be elected by the people, he has taken a firm public – and sometimes controversial – view on Britain’s decision to leave the EU.He attended the Liberal Democrats conference in September where he proudly showed off their “B*llocks to Brexit” t-shirt slogan and called Mr Johnson the “real traitor” in reply to briefings that Remain-backing MPs were “colluding” with the EU.Seen as a big player in the parliament, his influence is not on the same level as the aforementioned commission and council presidents.– Steve Baker\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Steve Baker MP The leader of that crew of hardline Tory Brexiteers, he has indicated he could back a deal secured by the PMthe DUP is in support of it.Mr Johnson has also been keeping him close and will be buoyed by Mr Baker’s use of the description “constructive” to paint a picture of discussions between his group and No .It was Mrs May’s failure to get the ERG on board for her deal that ultimately helped cost her the top job.Briefing reporters outside Downing Street on his meeting with the PM on Tuesday, Mr Baker said: “It was a very constructive conversation, and I am optimistic that it is possible for us to reach a tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fortnite gamers see map sucked into black hole","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So many people engage with survivors from a place of pity.”A record number of women are running in the  Democratic field, and women will be a pivotal bloc in both the primary and the general election.Still, women are too often treated like a special interest group rather than the majority of the American electorate, said Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which is partnering with #MeToo on voter education, mobilisation and turnout efforts over the next year.“The whole point of #MeTooVoter is to say that survivors are a huge political force and incredibly motivated in this moment,” Ms Poo said.“We’re going to be calling on anyone who’s serious about governing and leading this country forward to actually answer for how they’re going to make this country more safe.”Ms Burke said that nearly a year into the Democratic primary, none of the  hopefuls has spoken to her as they have shaped their presidential s, which she said points to a lack of urgency even amid a climate of increased awareness around the issue.She hopes #MeTooVoter will prompt debate moderators to ask a question about sexual violence at the next debate, but does not expect the topic to come up on Tuesday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The White House in Washington, US Whether #MeToo makes the debate stage or not, Ms Burke said she is considering a town hall around the issue to hear more fully from candidates about their stances.It was on the one-year anniversary of when #MeToo became a viral hashtag that Ms Burke was still reeling from the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination hearing focused largely on allegations of sexual assault when he was a teenager.The hearing, watched by millions and seen as a major turning point in the MeToo movement, was seen by some women as a setback to efforts to hold men accountable for sexual violence.For Ms Burke, the moment was a turning point.“It was the first time we saw survivors en masse come out and put their bodies on the line for this issue,” said Ms Burke.“It was the moment I realised we had to form as an organisation.“People are willing to stand up, march, talk, come out in the rain.Women dont feel safe in AmericaCecile Richards“People are ready for this moment.”Supermajority co-founder Cecile Richards said the issue of sexual violence is something the organisation, which is a #MeTooVoter partner, has identied as an election-year priority among women.“Any candidate who wants the support of women, I hope understands the importance of speaking to the issues that are on the minds of millions of voters in this country,” Ms Richards said.“Women don’t feel safe in America. There’s been very little conversation about this, and that’s unacceptable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry slow food festival huge success","story":"Foodies and families from near and far have been singing the praises of this year’s Slow Food Festival which attracted thousands of visitors before it drew to a close on Sunday.In its fourth year, the extended five-day event has been an outstanding success for organisers from Derry City and Strabane District Council.The two-day Harvest Market marquee which attracted dozens of local producers as well as celebrity chefs in the kitchen was supplemented this year with a full programme of additional foodie experiences, from an Italian extravaganza to a long table dining event, from beer and cheese tours to the launch of a new Irish oyster stout.The Lough Foyle Irish Flat Oyster was undoubtedly the star of the show with visitors queuing up to taste this seasonal delicacy unique to the area.The Mayor, Councillor Michaela Boyle, was delighted to see thousands of people from the region and further afield visit the city to feast on the flavours of the festival, the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland.She praised the council’s Tourism department, the local food producers, chefs and brewers who are helping shine a spotlight on the area as a dedicated food destination after having been named  NI Food and Drink Experience of the Year  by Tourism NI and Best Tourism Event at the North West Business Awards.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe event showcased top quality produce from fresh fish to charcuterie, preserves to hand-made confectionery, locally made honey, cheeses, granola, rapeseed oil and organic vegetables.Chefs from all over Ireland were in town, including Catherine Fulvio, Jenny Bristow, Brian McDermott and Ian Orr, to give inspiring cookery demonstrations using the abundance of fresh, local ingredients on hand.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively. Robert Davison finished in th with John McGuigan taking th.The Dromara Ladies had a full team out and it was Diane Wilson on her comeback who was first Dromara Lady home in fth with Martina Hawkins finishing closely behind in th. Andra Hamilton was enjoying the course and claimed a battling th place.The final race of the day was the menrsquos A race which saw Barry Kellett, Neil Armstrong and Derek Graham take to the start line.Kellett showed that moving the M category certainly hasnrsquot slowed him down as he battled with his younger rival Graham Boyd, from McConvey Cycles, for the top spot.This time it was Graham who held on to take the win, but an excellent second place and top M for Barry.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie. I think adults could learn from children as they might ask a question about the arm but once itrsquos answered, they move on as they are very accepting..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Brief.jpg","title":"Brief to redevelop Irish Street closer  ","story":"A DEVELOPMENT brief designed to transform the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent empty buildings could be ready within weeks, the Down Recorder understands.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.Final agreement has been reached with all key stakeholders to draw up a dedicated team to come up with a development brief which will outline what the local authority would like to see developed at a huge area of land.The brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area, while there are also plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise its potential and make the most of its historical heritage.When completed, the development brief will be advertised, inviting third parties to come forward with viable proposals for the site that will result in sustainable regeneration in Downpatrick town centre.It has also been confirmed that permission has been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.A number of the vacant buildings will be bulldozed to open up a huge area at the rear of the former police station, with the proposed development site also including the local authority-owned car park.But the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious multi-million pound regeneration plan. It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

A new shop front is also proposed alongside a new deli area, sanitary and internal seating facilities.Existing petrol pumps, fuel talks and canopy will also be replaced as part of the signicant investment proposal, alongside additional parking.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners say they received one objection to the proposal from a resident who lives nearby, with  neighbours notied about the proposal.The objection relates to proposals for changes to a traffic island outside the store on the busy Dundrum Road.The planning papers say the proposal will result in the relocation of eight fuel pumps and canopy along with an existing car wash, with the current retail unit extended. Additional fuel pumps also form par of the development proposal.Planners say that the redevelopment of the Barbican filling station is compatible with surrounding land use, will not harm the amenities of nearby residents, with the filling station and retail unit not at any risk from flooding.Signicantly, planners are content that the existing road network can cope with any extra vehicular activity at the Dundrum Road site and that adequate access arrangements and parking area is in place.One of the existing accesses to the site will be lost as a result of the redevelopment.Recommending that the amended plans should be approved, planners say that the site must only be used as a petrol filling station with no part used for the display or sale of vehicles and that all existing fuel tanks must be removed in line with current pollution guidance.Councillors will be told at next weekrsquos planning meeting thatduring development works, contamination risks are encountered which have not previously been identied, works should cease and planners notied immediately.The storersquos opening hours will remain unchanged when the redevelopment work is completed.

on the scheme mdash which started last month and is due to complete in November mdash includes a new footpath at the Killough Road and a new left turn lane from Pound Lane into the Killough Road.Other aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads officials say the scheme should improve traffic progression and that due to the nature of the work involved, it will be necessary to operate a number of off-peak road and lane closures.Signed ersions will be provided with the Department of Infrastructure asking motorists to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the works to help ensure the safety of road users and workers.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was pleased with the progress on the scheme and believes that extending the closure at Pound Lane

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

He was all over it like a rash.”In , Moy Park had been bought by giant Brazilian meat processor Marfrig in a  million deal. But within just seven years, Moy Park’s valuation more than doubled.In September  – as Moy Park’s farmers were piling into RHI – the company was sold to another Brazilian meat giant, JBS.Andrew CrawfordLess than a year later, bribery charges – unconnected to the Moy Park sale – would begin to be levelled at senior JBS figures in a massive scandal which would shake Brazilian society.Moy Park has since been sold by JBS – but to a company which it controls, Pilgrim’s Pride, in a sale which attracted further allegations and litigation from shareholders.In , Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil on a trade mission. In her role as Stormont’s enterprise, trade and investment minister, one of her major engagements was with Marfrig. and Nigel Dodds\"   and Nigel Dodds\"  DUP department used public cash in threat to injunct News Letter – over its own leakIrish Premier Leo Varadkar to raise outcome of citizenship with Boris Johnson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The book reveals Mrs Foster’s briefing notes, showing that on the night of May , she had been due to dine with Marfrig executives at the Michelin-starred Mani Manioca, one of Sao Paulo’s hippest restaurants.According to the briefing material, she was to conduct the key meeting – unusually – without her civil servants.It was the only event on the entire trade mission where one of Foster’s officials or an official from the British consulate did not accompany the minister.Only Dr Crawford and Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, a former DUP spad, were to be present. The unusual situation was justied on the basis that it was “to ensure that the two Marfrig representatives aren’t overwhelmed”.The purpose of the meeting was “to further discuss Marfrig’s presence in Northern Ireland”. When asked questions about the meeting, Foster and Crawford replied with a solicitor’s letter which did not answer the questions and failed to provide any explanation for what had gone on – but instead threatened to sue for libel.The letter also said that the meeting had been shted from dinner to breakfast and that the DUP figures “did not meet with Marfrig executives without officials present in order to ensure there was no minute of the meeting”.The letter added that a translator had been present, although it would not be the role of a translator to record a civil service minute of what transpired.Stormont’s rules state that departmental meetings with external iniduals must be minuted.When asked what she had done to ensure that an accurate record of the meeting was kept, Mrs Foster declined to respond.The year after Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil, Marfrig chief executive Sergio Rial said the company had “ongoing, positive engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive and have experienced a very pro-business attitude”.Responding to questions from the News Letter about why Mrs Foster met Marfrig executives without her civil servants being present, and what steps she had taken to ensure that an accurate record of what was discussed was kept, a DUP spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on issues related to the work of the public inquiry before that process has been completed.”try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaN.I. hotel F**k the Pope and the I.R.A. wedding video reported to police -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged.

ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day.

The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease.

It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference.

The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.
