Almost two centuries later, the kaiser’s classical aspirations have been fulfilled by British architect David Chipperfield, in the form of a dazzling white temple. Opening this weekend, after 20 years of planning, the James Simon Gallery stands as a €134m (£120m) Parthenon-on-Spree, forming a handsome new entrance to one of the world’s most important repositories of cultural treasures.“We were quite nervous,” says Chipperfield, standing in the lofty new ticketing lobby, where stripes of sunlight flood in between the row of slender white columns outside. “The challenge was how to create something that was of its context and also of our time, in this incredibly sensitive location.”He had good reason to be anxious. His first design, unveiled in 2006, was slammed by German critics as grossly misjudged for the Unesco world heritage site. The jumbled cluster of glass boxes was likened to “a glorified public toilet” by one prominent journalist, in a tirade published under the headline “Not like that, Mr Chipperfield!”The 65-year-old architect is no stranger to Berlin’s culture of fiery public debate. He worked for more than a decade to realise the acclaimed transformation of the Neues Museum, and is now engaged in refurbishing Mies van Der Rohe’s Neue Nationalgalerie, a holy of holies among architects. “It’s refreshing that architecture is subject to such robust debate here,” he says, lamenting what he sees as a lack of serious public discussion around the built environment in the UK. “They really hold your feet to the fire, which is painful at the time, but the work is better for it.”His team went back to the drawing board and took classical cues from the neighbours, taking a lead from the broad entrance staircase of Friedrich Schinkel’s Altes Museum, as well as Friedrich August Stüler’s unifying colonnade, and the weighty stone plinth of the Pergamon Museum next door. These elements have been deftly synthesised into a structure that is entirely its own, a kind of stripped-back, etiolated classicism that is at once imposing and delicate. The result is a strangely scaleless structure that appears monumental from some angles, dinky from others, with its real purpose hidden below ground.Named after one of the most prolific 19th-century Jewish donors to the museums’ collections (a gesture intended to recognise the many other such donors who were erased from history in the Nazi era), the building provides space for the practical functions that didn’t fit in the surrounding museums. It was a lengthy shopping list: ticketing, loos, cloakrooms, shop, cafe, auditorium and gallery for temporary exhibitions, some of which feel a bit squeezed into the narrow site. Chipperfield describes it pragmatically as “a sort of subway station”, serving as a central entrance hub with underground connections to the surrounding buildings. A tunnel now leads to the Neues Museum, and a big portal goes straight to the Pergamon, although the other links are a task for future generations.Anxious that it might be seen as a “dustbin of uses that didn’t fit elsewhere,” the architects have endowed their building with grandiosity in bucketloads: entering this functional underworld is more akin to ascending to a realm of the gods. A broad staircase leads up in three flights to a kind of temple mount, an elevated plateau where ticket desks and a cafe spill out on to a terrace overlooking the Kupfergraben canal. Chipperfield describes it as a “purposefully purposeless space”, a civic deck where people can come and take in the view for free and stroll between the surreally skinny columns – a line of 70 white concrete matchsticks that stand almost nine metres high but less than 30cm thick.Inside, there is a sophistication in the use of materials that Speer could only dream of. A huge wall of translucent white marble, just 6mm thick, casts a pale milky light into the entrance hall, while a perforated copper ceiling shimmers overhead. Steps lead down to a level of cloakrooms and loos, designed as a warm wooden world lined with book-matched walnut veneer – great tree-trunks thinly sliced and opened like the pages of a book, so the grain forms mirrored Rorschach patterns as it wraps around the walls.“We wanted the building’s concrete structure to be exposed, then lined with richly decorated surfaces formed by nature,” says Alexander Schwarz, design director of Chipperfield’s office in Berlin, a violin-maker-turned-architect whose attention to material detail oozes from every corner of the project. The 300-seat auditorium is a mini masterpiece, with concrete walls cast in pleated acoustic folds, and a ceiling that plunges down in three dark wooden waves like draped fabric. Elsewhere, wafer-thin steel benches are upholstered in pale leather, while dark patinated bronze brings a weighty touch to the doors (quite literally – they’re incredibly heavy to open).It all sings with the seductive Chipperfield brand of restrained opulence, but there is a slight sense throughout the building that architectural gesture sometimes overruled practical function. The circulation spaces are expansive, but the new 600 sq metre gallery for temporary shows feels a bit shoehorned into a corner, uncomfortably long and narrow. Meanwhile, a charming staircase leads down to the water along the canal-facing facade, suggesting the romantic Venetian possibility of arrival by boat, but sadly it is nothing of the sort: no boats will be permitted to stop here. “It’s an affectation,” Chipperfield admits. “A human gesture to suggest the building dipping its toe in the water.” With a vocal campaign underway to see this stretch of the waterway transformed into a public swimming area, it could be the perfect place for bathers to pad up the steps to sunbathe on the terrace – a suggestion that makes the museum directors tremble at the thought of people arriving at their sacred cultural citadel in dripping trunks.Which is a shame, because it could do with a touch of Berlin’s more bohemian, freewheeling spirit. It is an elegant and supremely well crafted building, but it feels a bit chilly, parked on the water’s edge like a superyacht. With luck, the swimmers will get their way, and the gleaming acropolis will live up to its intention of being a truly welcoming civic space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90552dd881cb8a819e0326202a8cb3f2b719418/0_438_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7336b68cb28a9993b28d0cc30a9b914","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Hong Kong protests, Cori Gauff at Wimbledon, Pride in New York and the Fourth of July celebrations – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12d561cc1c0dc742d1f9cb0efbd2e4b24969f791/0_2041_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2275aa186f34f35322e6217eb1d182e","title":"jokha alharthi a lot of women are really strong even though they are slaves","story":"The first Omani woman translated in English and winner of the Man Booker International prize reflects on her ‘lucky book’ Celestial Bodies and Oman’s uneasy relationship with its historyJokha Alharthi’s second novel, Celestial Bodies, may have its roots in rural Oman – its irrigation canals and high desert nights, its cool back rooms and busy courtyards – but it was born in Edinburgh. Alharthi was studying for a PhD at the university, she had an eight-month-old baby, and she and her husband had had difficulty finding a place to live and so were renting a small flat from week to week. Her stress was compounded by the fact that, although her PhD was in classical Arabic poetry, she was expected “to write fluent English, and to write fluent essays, and I was like, I never did that! I never did that. So I just came back to the flat one night and got the baby to sleep, and just sat there with my laptop thinking about – not exactly Oman, but a different life, and a different language. And because I love my language so much, I felt the need to write in my own language. So I just started writing.” She had already published one book, Dream, “a love story, kind of”, and for a long time had been thinking of another, with snatches of ideas and characters and places. “It wasn’t all clear in my mind, but I kept thinking about them, and also about the traditional ways, which are rapidly vanishing in Oman.” But she “hadn’t started yet, until that moment, when it was a really difficult moment for me. So it was like going back to my mother’s womb again, to feel warm, and secure. The novel – I don’t want to say it saved me, it’s a big word – but kind of.”Just over a decade later, in May this year, Celestial Bodies won the International Man Booker prize. Alharthi beat finalists including last year’s winner, Polish bestseller Olga Tokarczuk, and joined previous winners including Korean author Han Kang it was the first book from any Arab country to win. We meet the morning after, in a bright many windowed room on the top floor of the headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects in central London. Alharthi sits next to her translator, Marilyn Booth, who remembers that the translation, too, began in Edinburgh: Alharthi had not yet finished her PhD when her supervisor retired, and Booth took over (she is now professor in the study of the contemporary Arab world at Oxford). “She brought me her novel. And I just really loved it, and wanted to translate it.” Booth was so keen that she completed the translation before they had a publisher lined up, “which is not always a good idea”, she says. Celestial Bodies is the first novel by an Omani woman ever translated into English, and the prize, £50,000, is split equally between them.The book tells the story of three generations of a family from a village called al-Awafi. There are three daughters, their father and mother, their children and their husbands’ parents. The birth of a child called London (the capital of a foreign city, a Christian city no less, whisper appalled neighbours and relatives) is the hub from which all sorts of spokes radiate, then spin with speed and impressive control: within six pages we have been presented with an animating tragedy, and a memorable account of a woman giving birth, “standing as tall as a grand mare”. Alharthi’s characters are pleasingly contradictory and fallible, irreducibly inidual. A doting new father brings cases of baby food for an unweaned infant, an act that is “unnecessary and slightly disgraceful” a former slave locked away as “mad” by an embarrassed daughter calls out, whenever she hears a noise in the courtyard, “I’m here, I’m here, I’m Masoud and I’m in here”.To say that Celestial Bodies is a multi-generational saga simplifies what Alharthi has done, which is also to tell the story of how Oman has changed over the last century, from a traditional rural patriarchal society where Islam was complemented by Zār spirit worship, and which was among the last countries in the world to abolish slavery (in 1970), to an urban, oil-rich Gulf state. And she has done so in a form that shifts from voice to voice, viewpoint to viewpoint, decade to decade, sometimes within a single paragraph or sentence. It is no surprise that, as well as 10th-century Arabic poets such as Abū al-Tayyib Ahmad ibn Husayn al-Mutanabbī, and the more recent Mahmoud Darwish, Alharthi counts among her favourite writers Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera, Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata and Anton Chekhov, and that the first piece of fiction she published, at 18, was a short story. She has since written three collections of stories, which have been translated into five languages, as well as children’s books.Celestial Bodies was first published in 2010, and it has been a “lucky book” says Alharthi, who is 40 and is in person as direct and unshowily confident as her prose. “I think books are like people, some have lucky lives, and this book got a lot of attention.” The critics loved it, a master’s thesis has been written about it, and last year a critical study. She does almost all of our interview in fluent and authoritative English, but now she turns to Booth: “I want to say this in Arabic if you don’t mind, to put this in precise words – I don’t want to get it wrong.” “Some people feel that touching upon a sensitive topic like slavery is stirring up the past in a way that isn’t appropriate now,” says Booth after a moment, “because Oman is another country, and slavery is something of the past. But she’s saying that that’s what literature does – it’s to think about the past, to think about history.”Alharthi grew up immersed in history and especially in Arabic literature. An uncle was a poet and travel writer her grandfather was a poet who “when I was a child, in every situation would recite verses from Al-Mutanabbī to justify his position” – just as one of her characters, Azzan, does, to his beautiful Bedouin lover, who finds it increasingly alienating and irritating. Booth, who studies modern Arabic language and culture, and whose Arabic is in fact Egyptian Arabic (she has never been to Oman, and had to ask Alharthi to send her photos of typically Omani things she had not come across before), found these poems, with their double meanings and referents that stretch a thousand years into the past, by far the most challenging sections to translate. “She hated me for it!” laughs Alharthi.When Alharthi’s mother was growing up in the village of Al-Qabil there was no schooling beyond basic reading and writing for anyone, male or female, unless you went to the capital, Muscat, so she taught herself poetry, reciting it as she went about her daily chores. By the time Alharthi and her siblings were born things had changed, though there still wasn’t a kindergarten, so her father, who was the local governor, forged their birth certificates so they could start school early. “He thought we were too smart to sit at home.” Alharthi, who now lives in Muscat and teaches classical Arabic literature at Sultan Qaboos University, is one of eight sisters and four brothers. And where do you come? “OK, let me see,” she counts them off on her fingers, under her breath. “I think I’m number four.” The others have gone on to work in a wide range of jobs, from oil company employee to a brother in the foreign ministry and a sister who runs a communications company. Alharthi herself is married to a civil engineer and they have three children.One of the many striking things in Celestial Bodies is the way Alharthi refuses easy assumptions about power, and people’s roles in the world. There is a moment, for instance, where she focuses on the childhood of one of the main characters, a matriarch, Salima, who started off as a poor female relative. Then she was not allowed to eat or be clothed as an equal with rich relatives, but at the same time she was not allowed to mix with the servants, to bathe like them, or dance as the slave girls do. Adult Salima cannot abide Zarifa, a former slave from her son-in-law’s family, who runs the household, has the love and devotion of her supposed master and his son, and has the power in all but name. “For me it’s always complicated,” says Alharthi, “the relationships are complicated, and people claim their authority wherever they are. A lot of women are really strong, even though they are slaves actually, but they still can be strong.” Each chapter is named after the person from whose point of view it is told, but it is interesting that the only one who speaks in the first person is a man, Abdallah – again supposedly the inheritor of riches, a businessman, the head of his household, the man in a man’s world who ought to have all the power. “But Abdallah doesn’t!” says Alharthi, partly because of old hurts, partly because of the intensity with which he loves someone who does not love him back, partly because his world is changing so fast, partly because of the strength of the women who surround him. “You’d assume that the first-person character is the one who’s got some authority,” adds Booth, “and he’s really the most vulnerable.”How does Alharthi feel about the much wider readership this prize might give her? She is silent for a while. “I don’t know, it is strange … yanni” – she turns again to Booth English phrases pop like bubbles out of urgent Arabic. “It’s wonderful to have a bigger readership,” says Booth at last, “and to have readers everywhere, but it’s also a slightly strange feeling, because these are characters that came out of her mind. They developed within her own thinking and they’re going out into the world and other people are reading about them and thinking about them, and it’s slightly hard to let go.” Or, as Salima says about her daughters: “We raise them so that strangers can take them away.” There is the further point of culture, says Alharthi, which is that “when it was published in Arabic, the Arabic audience in general and the Omani audience in particular can easily relate to the novel” – and non-Arabs cannot really be expected to feel the same sense of recognition. “But I still think that what attracts us to literature is not that it’s familiar to us, it’s that we can relate to the universal value in it. Even if it has a very strong mahaliya” – “localness”, supplies Booth – “still I hope that international readers can relate to the universal values in it.” • Celestial Bodies is published by Sandstone (RRP £8.99).

The disembodied broadcaster details new parking measures, issues with the pneumatic waste disposal chute and various building maintenance jobs to be carried out that day.“There’s no way of turning it off,” sighs Kim’s wife, Jung-sim, as she prepares breakfast. “I hate technology but my husband is an early adopter. He has to have everything first.”It was Kim’s love of the latest tech that prompted him move his family to the future, or the nearest thing to it – Songdo, South Korea’s self-styled “smart city”, built on a 600-hectare parcel of artificial land dredged from the Yellow Sea near Seoul’s Incheon airport. It is a place where the garbage is automatically sucked away through underground pipes, where lampposts are always watching you, and where your apartment block knows to send the elevator down to greet you when it detects the arrival of your car. Sensors in every street track traffic flow and send alerts to your phone when it’s going to snow, while you can monitor the children’s playground on TV from the comfort of your sofa.The feature Kim enjoys most is a small touchscreen display on his kitchen wall that charts allows him to keep track of his and his wife’s consumption of electricity, water and gas and, most important, compare it against the average statistics for the building. Flicking between the screens of bar charts and graphs, a broad grin spreads across his face: for yet another day running, they are more energy-efficient than all their neighbours.From their living room window at the top of one of the city’s new residential towers, a panorama of downtown Songdo unfolds. Across an eight-lane highway lies Central Park, a broad swath of trees surrounding an ornamental lake, flanked by rows of glass towers with vaguely jaunty silhouettes. Armies of identikit concrete apartment blocks march into the hazy distance beyond, terminating at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It looks a lot like many other modern Asian cities, a place of generic towers rising above a car-dominated grid. Public life is mostly confined to the air-conditioned environments of malls and private leisure clubs.Initiated by the South Korean government in the late 1990s, when Incheon airport was being planned, Songdo represents a model that has been replicated numerous times around the world. Begun as a joint venture with US developer Gale International – which has since hawked its “city in a box” kit to other countries – the Songdo International Business District was conceived as a $40bn hub for international companies, an exemplar of sustainable urbanism and testing ground for new smart city technologies.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?It claims to have the highest concentration of green Leed-certified buildings in the world, yet it is still entirely car-based, with not even a train line to the nearby airport. To get to Seoul, just 30km away, takes an hour and a half by metro. Songdo may have an “Integrated Operations Centre” – a Big Brother control room where reams of data are funnelled in real time from thousands of sensors across the city – but the physical urban model is no different to any other car-riddled business district. For all its low-energy labels, it is an expensive, exclusive and impersonal place.Across the world, there are countless new cities like Songdo in the making. Barely differentiable, and often designed and serviced by the same international consultancies, these hi-tech urban enclaves are cropping up from Kenya to Kazakhstan . India has pledged to build 100 smart cities, while Africa is seeing $100bn pumped into at least 20 projects. China, having initiated 500 of its own smart city pilots, is now summoning a string of outposts through its Belt and Road initiative, from the dry port of Khorgos, on its border with Kazakhstan, to east London’s Royal Albert Dock, reborn as the Asian Business Park.Saudi Arabia has pledged to trump them all with Neom, a $500bn mega-project billed as an answer to Silicon Valley. Planned as a centre for renewable energy, biotechnology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, it sprawls across an area 33 times the size of New York City. It claims to be nothing less than “the world’s most ambitious project” an incubator for “the next era of human progress”.The escapist urge to build cities from scratch is nothing new. At the turn of the 19th century, the Garden City movement saw a generation of bucolic communities planned in reaction to the grime and overcrowding of rapidly industrialising cities, driven by a powerful campaign for social reform. Half a century later, the New Town movement developed these ideas, promising a brave new world of modern, self-sufficient municipalities rising from the ruins of the second world war, and focused on building an inclusive, democratic society.Now, in the first decades of a new millennium, a surge in global population growth and a sense of impending environmental armageddon have spurred an epidemic of planned cities of a very different kind. This time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged gated communities and tax-exempt free-trade hubs, each branded as the ultimate techno-eco-utopia.According to research from Savills, real estate is now a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitised debt combined, with a total value of around $228tn. That represents three and a half times global GDP, or 40 times the value of all the gold ever mined. While once we dug down to extract value from the earth, the bristling glass towers of these new urban enclaves are the inverted mineshafts of today – complete with equally damaging side effects.This new breed of city takes various different forms, from government initiatives, to public-private partnerships, to entirely private enterprises. Many are being used to jump-start economies in the developing world, with masterplans carefully calibrated to attract foreign investors and treasuries looking to sink their funds into something concrete. They provide a powerful means for wealthy countries to expand their strategic influence abroad, with the construction of new cities acting as a form of “debt-trap diplomacy”, tying host nations into impossibly burdensome deals. They are billed as a panacea for the world’s urban ills, solving overcrowding, congestion and pollution yet, more often than not, they turn out to be catalysts for land dispossession, environmental degradation and social inequality.At the southern tip of Malaysia on a series of four artificial islands, one such promised Elysium is sprouting from the sand. Launched in 2014, Forest City is a $100bn joint venture between the Chinese developer Country Garden and the Sultan of Johor. It is planned to house 700,000 people by 2050.Forest City has been marketed as an “iconic urban area” moments from Singapore, a “new Shenzhen” where the “concepts of safety, convenience, green and smart are integrated into every corner of life”. It features luxury apartment towers, hotels, offices, shopping malls and an international school, all smothered with a lush blanket of greenery and surrounded by a “virtual electric fence”.The apartments are prohibitively expensive for most Malaysians but a relative bargain for Chinese investors, who have been flown here in droves and bussed to the spaceship-shaped sales gallery to marvel at the enormous model of the Avatar-like world that awaits. Cashiers stand at the end of the guided tour to take credit card down-payments before the tourists get back on the bus.This self-styled “eco-city” is being built on 162m cubic metres of shipped-in sand that has already had a damaging impact on the surrounding marine environment. The causeway built to facilitate the land reclamation for the islands cuts right across the Tanjung Kupang seagrass meadows, a precious habitat that helps to stabilise the sea floor and protect coastal erosion, while mangroves have been trampled to make way for the development’s prefabrication factories.Reclamation began without the required environmental impact assessment, and the effects have already been felt by local fishermen, who complain of reduced catches due to the destruction of their fragile ecosystem. The emerging island community, meanwhile, is not so much a city as a ghostly duty-free resort, a haunted Photoshop montage mostly bereft of full-time residents.A similar story is taking place thousands of miles away on the west coast of Africa, where “an investment opportunity on an unprecedented scale” is being touted on a patch of sand dredged from the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Lagos. Eko Atlantic is another public-private partnership, this time brokered between the state government and the Chagoury Group, an influential Nigerian business empire, with engineering expertise provided by the China Communications Construction Company – a state-owned conglomerate that appears to have cornered the market in conjuring land from the ocean, being responsible for dredging Forest City as well as terraforming disputed islands in the South China Sea.Eko Atlantic is protected by its own sea defence barrier made of 100,000 five-tonne concrete blocks, dubbed the “Great Wall of Lagos”, making it a secure private island for the few, shielded from climate catastrophe at the expense of others. It is a raised atoll for the wealthy Nigerian elite, while the poor remain consigned to low-lying coastal slums whose exposure to deadly flooding and coastal erosion has only increased since the construction of the sea wall.As the environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey put it, the project “is contrary to anything one would want to do if one took seriously climate change and resource depletion”. As if to cement Donald Trump’s image as the poster boy for climate denial, the US embassy recently announced it will be relocating to a secure five-hectare compound there.The glamorous computer-generated visions of Lagos’s exclusive new appendage have sparked a thirst for similarly futuristic and climate-inappropriate schemes across the continent, as countries race to provide the answer to housing the additional 1.3 billion people that are projected to be added to Africa’s population by 2050. Ghana unveiled plans for the Hope City – Hope is an acronym of Home, Office, People and Environment – a $10bn fantasy that would be home to Africa’s tallest building.It has been joined by Tanzania’s Kigamboni New City in Dar es Salaam, Kenya’s Tatu City in Nairobi, Rwanda’s Vision City in Kigali, and Senegal’s plans for the $2bn Diamniadio Lake City (designed by the appropriately named Bad Consultant) – all of which follow the cookie-cutter approach of car-based, hi-tech hubs, rarely planned with existing populations in mind.As Rachel Keeton and Michelle Provoost of the International New Town Institute say in their new book, To Build a City in Africa: “New Towns are becoming islands with high quality services, while many existing African cities continue to suffer from unreliable electricity provision, limited access to clean water, and other ineffectual municipal services. Because of limited access to mortgages and other home financing models, the real African middle class cannot afford to live in these New Towns.”Despite the evidence of half-built utopias lying mostly empty around the world, the seductive dream of building new cities from scratch shows no sign of abating any time soon. City-making, and the innumerable planning, engineering and technical services that go with it, is a booming industry, and corporations are intent on recycling their ideas irrespective of local context.Back in Songdo – whose developers proudly list the exotic destinations where their ideas have since been rolled out – an innovation centre showcases the latest in parking violation sensors and crime-fighting lampposts, all branded with the u-City logo. Why “u”, I ask? “It stands for ubiquitous,” says the company rep. “Ultimately, we want our kind of city to be everywhere.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0750a11fdc4c00f689636663b1b7791c7877859/0_167_2408_1445/master/2408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7ee5bf0b5ff4d953fe7e79613a38f59","title":"labour centre ground jeremy corbyn","story":"The country is crying out for an effective opposition, and yet Jeremy Corbyn cannot grasp the opportunityIn the atrium of Portcullis House last week, I saw Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy chatting over a cup of tea. Which got me thinking: it was no stretch at all to imagine these two talented politicians as prime minister and chancellor, discussing the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.This prompted a further thought: how easy it would be to construct a pretty decent cabinet from Labour’s backbenches: Jess Phillips, Seema Malhotra, Owen Smith, Stephen Kinnock, Gloria De Piero, Angela Eagle and David Lammy for a start. Then add in a handful of existing frontbenchers – Tom Watson, Keir Starmer – and, before you knew it, you’d have the basis of an electable Labour government with a fighting chance of uniting the country and governing it competently.At which point, Barry Gardiner walked over to greet a colleague – and my private game of Fantasy Government was terminated abruptly by this bleak reminder of what Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet (with a few honourable exceptions) is actually like.It was a tiny parable, indicative of a gigantic political problem. In my adult life – and I include 1997 – the nation has never been so obviously screaming for a sensible Labour government.The Conservative party is exhausted, delirious, badly in need of an Uber off to the quieter pastures of opposition, where it can have a nice little sleep. But it is a huge mistake to imagine that this Uber will arrive of its own accord. The deepest Conservative instinct is to cling on to power, and the only force that can break its grip is Labour.When that election comes, both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats will have new leaders. Corbyn will be old news. What, four years into his leadership, will be the source of his momentum, his drive, his implacable claim to office?Populism is volatile stuff: it is the political branch of pop culture, and, as such, mostly ephemeral. Who now remembers Corbyn’s star performance at Glastonbury in 2017? Like most hits, it had its moment, blazed across the sky and was then forgotten.Since then, the Labour leader has failed abjectly to handle the antisemitism row in a manner befitting a future prime minister. The lack of urgency with which he has managed this internal party crisis has been morally contemptible – as is the refrain that every news report on this subject is axiomatically a “smear”.If Corbyn cannot deal speedily with the people in his party’s ranks who hate Jews, what are the odds that he will be able to manage the nation’s education system, or the NHS, or its defence?On Brexit, we cruise towards a no-deal departure on 31 October. In such desperate circumstances, you do not have to be a remainer to conclude that the public should be consulted again in a fresh referendum. Such an offer, made unambiguously and without qualification by Labour, would electrify the political landscape. Like all such decisions, it would bear an element of risk. But that is the essence of statesmanship.Whether he likes it or not, this is the great opportunity of Corbyn’s leadership: one he did not seek, but with which he is confronted nonetheless. The goal is two miles wide. The goalkeeper lies unconscious on the pitch. The ball is two inches away from the line. And – thus far – Corbyn’s instinct has been to nudge the ball feebly to the left, promising only to consult his members and the unions on the extent to which goal-scoring is consistent with authentic socialism.All such arguments are routinely dismissed as Blairite rubbish, the bletherings of the “metropolitan elite”, the voice of those who have “learned nothing”. In response to which I think: oh well, go ahead and lose if you like.But then I wonder if the clique that has the Labour party in its grip would be the true losers of an election defeat. The people that really suffer when Labour fails are the people it was established to protect: those who need the living wage whose level Boris Johnson does not even know those who have paid the price for the failures of universal credit those who need alleviation of the immigration “hostile environment” a government prepared to tax wealth to subsidise the 21st-century NHS and social care.At this level of politics, in times like these, feeling righteous is not enough. In fact, in the greater scheme of things, it isn’t anything at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35a99fb39d0018c40dc4ab8b808a877e9ec96e6/0_158_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3bae8fc5e241d5775baa5ca8e6cc6d","title":"somalia climate emergency world drought somalis","story":"Increasingly severe and frequent droughts are threatening the lives of millions of Somalis. But international support is lackingThe climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world, and it is the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the crisis. In Somalia, where I am acting country director for the aid agency Islamic Relief, the population is currently experiencing a drought that could threatenthe lives or livelihoods of more than two million people by the end of the summer, according to the UN.The climate has been wreaking havoc on Somalia’s seasons. Ordinarily there are four: the main rainy season between April and June (gu), the second rainy season between October and December (deyr), and the dry seasons that follow each of them. Two-thirds of the country’s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock. Last year, these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual. And again this year the gu rains almost failed, eventually arriving in tiny pockets of the country too little, too late. This has led to widespread crop failure, and a decline in livestock production, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity.In recent years, the frequency and duration of these dry spells has increased. As it does so, the capacity of people to resist these shocks decreases. Every drought depletes their assets: their animals will die, their crops will fail, they will have nothing to sell and next season they won’t have money to buy seeds to plant again. In desperation, pastoralists sell their animals at a giveaway price, leaving them even more vulnerable. Doing so significantly reduces their number of cattle to below the minimum threshold required to continue raising livestock. At this point they begin to flee and become displaced, often in informal camps near urban settlements.I recently saw how extreme weather can throw the delicate lives of the most vulnerable off-kilter. Our staff met Geelo Ahmed Osman, a mother of five from Ainabo district, Somaliland, in an informal camp for internally displaced people (IDPs), where she now lives. She has been entrusted with a great deal of responsibility. Four of her five children are disabled with conditions so severe they cannot move without assistance – and her fifth is completely emaciated with malnourishment. Because her husband had a stroke last year, she is now the breadwinner for the entire household.Two years ago, another drought hit Osman and her family hard. Her household, who were pastoralists, lost all their animals. In the two years since, they have been entirely reliant on handouts from their relatives, and when their relatives could no longer offer to support them, they moved to the outskirts of Ainabo district and joined an informal IDP settlement in the hope that they will get assistance from aid organisations.The current drought has led to more and more people like Geelo Ahmed Osman, displaced from their homes and reliant on support from the international community. About half of the country’s population is in need of emergency assistance. If they don’t receive this, we are very likely to see a full-scale famine before the end of the year. Lack of water does not just have nutritional implications: it spreads disease. If people don’t have water to wash at critical times, they can’t stem the spread of disease, which becomes inevitable in crowded IDP camps. Things such as diarrhoea, if untreated, can be fatal to children.Aid agencies need more funding, and not just for immediate assistance. With the climate crisis increasing these kinds of events in frequency and intensity, we could be in this exact same situation next year, the year after, and on and on. So while the first phase of intervention should be emergency response, we then need to build resilience so people are better prepared for the future and not reliant on handouts from the international community.The sad thing is that around the world emergencies are on the increase: from the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen to devastating natural disasters such as Cyclone Idai in south-east Africa. The climate crisis will only bring more disaster. But at the moment, the attention, funding and support from the international community is not there. It is crucial that, in our turbulent and increasingly unstable world, Somalia is not left behind.• Mustapha Tahir is acting country director for Islamic Relief in Somalia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

Fortunately, an army of volunteers – and a couple of international cricket stars – came to the rescueRelocation can be daunting enough when it’s by choice and you’re just one family leaving and needing to find a new home for an entire cricket club takes it to another level. That was the task facing Uttoxeter Cricket Club when they found out that their lease was not going to be renewed.The search for a new ground was neither swift nor easy but the solution did come from somewhere close by. Just four miles down the road the village of Marchington offered a glimmer of hope. “The village club had disbanded in the early 2000s,” says James Burton, head of fundraising at Uttoxeter, who led the committee overseeing the move. “There had been a little bit of cricket in the intervening period, but there hadn’t been a permanent club for about 15 years.”The ground was in a state of disrepair, and investment was clearly needed to give the ground “a radical facelift”, says Burton – so when Staffordshire Cricket Board and NatWest CricketForce, among others, stepped in to help, the sense of relief was huge. “Staffs cricket and the ECB putting faith in us – that was massive. It felt like some value was seen in our vision,” he says.CricketForce, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) initiative with long-time cricket supporter NatWest, helps community clubs upgrade their facilities, making it easier for communities to enjoy a huge summer of cricket.“The building work started in around October last year, so it was a real race against time to get ready for the new season,” says Burton. The club’s first game was scheduled for 20 April 2019.Ensuring that deadline was met – and adding a bit of excitement to the proceedings – were England cricketers Chris Woakes and Danielle Wyatt, who joined an army of volunteers mucking in with CricketForce.“CricketForce has been massive for us,” says Burton. “The number of people there from the village was phenomenal. People who we’d never even met came and supported us and gave their time generously.“Chris and Danielle were brilliant. Everything we asked of them, endless photographs, autographs, you name it. They were getting stuck in.“It was lucky some of our juniors weren’t at school that day. It was a great chance to meet their heroes.”With the work completed, Uttoxeter were ready for their first game. As too were the locals. Starved of cricket since the early 2000s, many returned to the ground, keen to hear the crack of leather on willow.“We’ve got a community,” says Burton. “We’ve got somewhere we know is home, and we’re starting to put structures in place and build on all the hard work that has gone before.And the club is seeing benefits beyond the increase in spectators. New players have joined both the adult and children’s teams, and the club has increased in size overall. “A number of adults have made their debut this season and we’ve got a number of juniors who have joined us too,” says Burton. “Previously they wouldn’t have found out about Uttoxeter Cricket Club.”“We go all the way up to under-13s now, whereas previously it was only under-eights,” adds Burton, who is also one of the junior coordinators at Uttoxeter.He is particularly proud of the fact that some of the under-13s have made their debut in the second team this season. “That, for us – the fact the youngsters are integrating in the club, mixing with senior players – has been the big payoff,” he says.As with any move, particularly in sport, a difficult adjustment period is almost inevitable, however – and Uttoxeter hasn’t been immune to this. “The first and second teams are both in the relegation zones at the moment, and our under-11s have played two and lost two. But the under-13s, at least, are top of the league.”However, with the success of the club’s off-the-field move undeniable, Burton is glad the attention can finally be on the sport: “It’s almost like cricket can start being the focus now. We’re here and this is now the beginning. The new challenge is starting.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game, to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

The loss of life expectancy is worse in Birmingham than some other major cities in the UK including Manchester, researchers found.Birmingham is one of five cities required by the government to set up a clean air zone to reduce toxic air, as part of plans to tackle the illegal levels of pollution in 38 out of 43 areas of the country.But in Birmingham and Leeds the start date of January next year has been postponed because of government delays in providing vehicle-checking software.On Monday research commissioned by UK100 – a network of local leaders across the country – for the first time examines the burden air pollution places on mortality in major cities.The report, carried out by Kings College London, said the health cost of the city’s toxic air was £470m every year.The study examined NO2 and PM2.5, two of the leading causes of poor health from air pollution, in the city’s 10 constituencies. It found that air pollution had the greatest impact in the most deprived areas, and that men are more likely to be affected than women. In Erdington, up to 91 deaths are attributable annually to air pollution, compared with up to 59 in Edgbaston and 57 in Hall Green.Waseem Zaffar, cabinet member for transport and environment on the city council, said the results were shocking.“They demonstrate the sheer scale of the major public health crisis we are dealing with in Birmingham today,” he said.“One life cut short by poor air quality is one too many, so this is exactly why the city is taking forward measures such as the clean air zone and why we continue to work with other cities across the country to tackle this problem together, but we also need strong leadership on this issue at a national government level.”Sue Huyton, coordinator of the Clean Air Parent’s network, said action was needed now.“It’s awful that children living in the UK are breathing air that may shorten their lives. As a parent, you want to do everything you can for your children, but when it comes to air pollution you can feel helpless – that’s why those in power must step up.“We need the government and Birmingham city council to take ambitious action to tackle the toxic air in this city, and we need them to do it now.”Air pollution has been identified by Public Health England as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK. Evidence shows that it can cause or worsen a range of lung and heart conditions including asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic heart disease and stroke. Research suggests air pollution caused by NO2 and PM2.5 could cause 36,000 deaths per year.Polly Billington, director of UK100, said the report should be a wake-up call to policy makers.“We need to tackle this invisible killer which is cutting the lives of children and causing health misery for thousands of adults. By working together, local councils and central government can put in place ambitious and inclusive clean air zones to tackle the most polluting sources of dirty air and let us breathe freely.”The government has been forced by the courts to improve its plans to clean up the air, after losing legal action taken by environmental lawyers Client Earth.A government spokesperson said: “We are aware of concerns over delays and are carrying out work to develop key components of the system to support the Charging Clean Air Zones for January 2020.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43716fbfda71ce297b03a645f5162b33f94069d7/0_626_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94df54148c974a9b231c44a55f385b9","title":"thomasina miers recipe cherry bundt cake","story":"A boozy, fruity bundt cake enhanced by cherries poached in star anise and a sharp lemon drizzleCherries are a summer fruit I find hard to resist, with their scarlet juices and rich, berry flavour.

You don’t need a huge amount for this almondy bundt cake, but they lend it a beautiful, crimson hue and, of course, give it that delectable cherry taste.Gently poaching the cherries in star anise and kirsch does wonders for their flavour.250g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing325g plain flour, plus extra for dusting200g fresh cherries, stems removed3 tbsp maple syrup1 star anise, ground in a spice grinder or mortar1 tbsp kirsch (optional)500g caster sugar6 large eggs½ tsp salt¼ tsp almond extract2 tsp baking powder300ml whole milk100g ground almonds1 lemon, finely grated zestFor the drizzle1 lemon, finely grated zest and juice175g icing sugarHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan) 350Fgas 4. Using the butter wrapper (or kitchen towel), thoroughly grease a large bundt tin (or a 26-28cm round cake tin) with butter, then dust generously with flour and shake out the excess.Put the cherries, maple syrup, star anise and kirsch (if using) in a small pan with a splash of water, and simmer for four to five minutes until soft, pressing down on the cherries with a potato masher or wooden spoon to release the stones. Cool slightly, then remove the stones. Whizz the cherries to a puree with a stick blender, then set aside.Beat the sugar and butter in an electric mixer until pale – three to four minutes – then incorporate the eggs one at a time until just mixed in. Next, being careful not to over-beat the mixture, fold in half the flour, the salt, almond extract and baking powder, until just incorporated, then stir in the milk. Fold in the remaining flour, followed by the ground almonds and lemon zest.Spoon a third of the mixture into the cake tin, then spoon over half the cherry puree, swirling it in a little. Top with another third of the cake mixture, and swirl in the remaining cherry puree. Top with the last of the cake mixture, then bake on the middle shelf for 50-60 minutes, or until golden and a skewer inserted into the middle section of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.While the cake is cooling, whisk the lemon zest and juice into the icing sugar to make a pourable drizzle (you may need to add a splash of water). Once the cake is cool, spoon over the icing, allowing the drips to fall down the sides. Serve with a pot of tea and a bowl of whipped cream or creme fraiche.Swirl excess cherry puree through homemade vanilla ice-cream for a special dessert: homemade ice-cream always makes people smile.

They share the sacrifice, solidarity – and ice baths – that got them to the World CupEmbarrassingly, there were tears running down my face when I stepped into the roaring stands for England’s first match of the 2019 Women’s World Cup in Nice. Football is just a game, but for women players it is hard to disengage from the sexism and stresses that accompany it. Watching Nikita Parris flowing down the wing, smashing in a penalty at the 14th minute, then Ellen White’s initial offside goal being rewarded by the real deal: I know how hard their predecessors had fought for these moments of unadulterated joy.The frenzy of press and promotion in the lead up to this year’s tournament was unprecedented. But Goal Click, a five-year-old social enterprise that sends disposable cameras to footballers around the world and then publishes the results online (alongside candid interviews), has been well ahead of the strike. Before the tournament, their cameras ended up in the hands of 18 international players, including England right-back Lucy Bronze, Jamaica defender Lauren Silver and USA midfielder Sam Mewis. All have captured the beautiful game in a singularly personal way.From the start, we have tried to represent the full ersity of the game,” says Goal Click co-founder Matthew Barrett. “Our second story was about an Indian girls football team in Mumbai.” Other projects have included the Homeless World Cup and the Single Leg Amputee Sports Association in Sierra Leone. “I have more interest in women’s football stories off the pitch because, quite frankly, they are deeper and more meaningful,” adds Barrett. The women’s game is known for its close friendships, and the photographs highlight these bonds, formed both at club and international level. “In the men’s game, I don’t think there is that same sense of camaraderie,” Barrett says. “You’re not best mates.”The photographs give an intimate view of life beyond the match-day theatrics. Chelsea players pile on to charter planes (the women’s game can’t afford private jets just yet) a Norwegian team play in the snow and Australians warm up on the beach. There are messy boot rooms, selfies and “leg-fies” by stars such as France’s Eugénie Le Sommer. Mewis’s image of USA teammates Rose Lavelle and Alex Morgan staring up at the camera as they kneel in an ice water bath is a particular highlight for Barrett: “It really stood out as a photo that could only have been taken by a teammate.”With Thailand striker Miranda Nild as one of his contributors, her team’s brutal 13-0 loss to the USA was difficult to sit through but surprisingly Barrett says he is glad it happened. “That scoreline is what used to happen in men’s football in the 1960s and 70s, before proper investment went into national sides.”Every player featured on these pages hopes to inspire a new generation, and my favourite shot from Goal Click’s project is of a teenage grassroots player – Sushanti Kumari in India, a football balanced on her nose above a wide smile.

Yet the highly coveted 22-year-old has repeatedly indicated that he favours Valencia, even though they are offering him lower wages.Valencia finished fourth in La Liga last season, earning them qualification to the Champions League, and the lure of playing at the highest level seemed to have informed Gomez’s decision. It is understood they had agreed a €16m deal which would have also involved them sending Santi Mina to Vigo. They thought the transfer was all but done last Friday.Yet West Ham, who had already released Andy Carroll and sold Lucas Pérez to Alavés, stepped up their pursuit of Gómez after deciding to let Arnautovic move to China when the Austrian forward kicked up another fuss last week. Pellegrini told the board to sell Arnautovic for the sake of squad morale and wanted the transfer to be concluded swiftly enough to ensure the former Stoke City player did not have to report for pre-season training in Switzerland on Monday.The decision to get rid of Arnautovic leaves a hole in West Ham’s attack, forcing them to respond quickly and decisively. With Arnautovic following Carroll and Pérez out of the door, the only senior strikers on their books are Javier Hernández and Jordan Hugill, who has made no impact since joining from Preston North End in January 2018 and spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough.They are also likely to miss out on another of their targets, West Bromwich Albion’s Salomón Rondón. Rafael Benítez wants the Venezuelan striker to follow him to China and join Dalian Yifang. West Ham also believe that Andrea Belotti, rated at €70m by Torino, is too expensive. That leaves them to focus on Gómez.When West Ham had a £25m bid rejected for him last month their information was that Gómez, who has scored 30 goals in 71 league appearances for Vigo, wanted to play in the Champions League, giving Valencia the edge. When they decided to hijack Valencia’s bid on Friday, they were told to raise their latest offer of £40m.Gomez’s contract contains a €50m (£44.5m) buyout clause and West Ham were told they would have to trigger it to stand any chance of signing the striker. With their funds boosted by the sale of Arnautovic, they offered that amount late on Sunday night, albeit they have yet to agree whether to pay the fee in one lump sum or in separate instalments.West Ham have made three signings this summer. They have recruited two goalkeepers on free transfers, David Martin and Fernando, and raised excitement with the £24m signing of Pablo Fornals from Villarreal. The attacking midfielder helped Spain to win the Under-21 European Championship last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6543ecbc8ec3bd77a8f15a1a01bf2cd1cc1d2759/140_130_3135_1881/master/3135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=598dd417fb82c22647c64a4a5ed76dc9","title":"womens world cup 2019 usa womens team victory","story":"Complacency, attacks from Donald Trump and the battle for equal pay were supposed to catch up with the Americans. They still lifted the trophyThere were plenty of reasons to expect the US wouldn’t repeat as Women’s World Cup champions. Most teams only need to beat their opponents. For the Americans, meanwhile, it often seemed like they had to accomplish that task while taking on their president as well as social inequality.Yes, the US were used to pressure. They had won the World Cup in 2015, but clinching back-to-back World Cups is exceedingly rare – it had only happened once on the women’s side and twice on the men’s. It’s far too easy for complacency creep in — just look at how Germany stumbled in the men’s World Cup last year after winning in 2014.And it’s not as if it had been smooth-sailing for the Americans since they won in 2015. With veterans like Abby Wambach retiring, the look of the team changed, and then the Americans suffered a humiliating and early exit at the 2016 Olympics. The US, despite their history of dominance, just didn’t look as imposing as they once had.Maybe the rest of the world had caught up. Maybe Jill Ellis wasn’t a good coach. Maybe the squad – the oldest in the tournament – was past it. And maybe the players were distracted by the dispute over equal pay with their bosses at the US Soccer Federation.Indeed, by the time the US arrived in France, that dispute had reached fever pitch. Every player on the team has sued US Soccer in federal court – the case will be heard in the coming weeks – and, for many, the topic became a sort of Rorschach test about feminism and equality. The players, who had to file their lawsuit before the World Cup began, were getting dragged into isive and potentially distracting conversations. They didn’t need to win the World Cup to secure equal pay (and nor should they) but it sure as hell would help.Even the President of the United States seemed to have a problem with the anointed “bad guys” of the Women’s World Cup. Donald Trump didn’t like that Megan Rapinoe had said she would not attend the White House if the team won the tournament, and suddenly everyone on the team had to decide whether they would defy Trump and the more toxic parts of his fanbase. Suddenly, this was a team that – fairly or unfairly – represented a lot more than the hopes of just soccer fans.And then there were the worries on the pitch: Hope Solo, arguably the greatest goalkeeper the women’s game has ever seen, was no longer on the team, and the untested Alyssa Naeher looked error prone. The back line in front of her had been built to be ultra-attacking and looked vulnerable to quick counterattacks.Megan Rapinoe\u0027s goal from the penalty spot in the final gave her the Golden Boot ahead of USA teammate Alex Morgan. Both players scored six goals and got three assists, but Rapinoe did so in fewer minutes. England\u0027s Ellen White came third with six goals, after having goals disallowed in the semi-final and third-place play-off.Rapinoe also won the Golden Ball for the tournament\u0027s best player, with England full-back Lucy Bronze second and USA midfielder Rose Lavelle third. The Golden Glove was won by Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, with Germany\u0027s Guilia Gwinn awarded best young player.Once the games started, however, those vulnerabilities didn’t seem so glaring. Sure, Naeher made a couple mistakes, but there weren’t costly – the US still steamrolled through the group stage without conceding a single goal. They dropped 13 goals on Thailand, three on Chile and another two on Sweden, setting scoring records along the way.That wasn’t enough though. Pundits, anxious US fans and opponents still looked for reasons why the US would eventually lose. Maybe USA’s opponents in the group stage hadn’t been enough of a test, or in Sweden’s case, with a second-string team, maybe they didn’t try hard enough.And yes, the Americans had looked utterly dominant against Thailand – but to some they also looked arrogant too. The team celebrated all 13 goals they scored against the minnows, and the US quickly became the villains that neutrals were rooting against. The target was squarely on the backs of the USA players.But then Rapinoe, who had already irked some with her willingness to speak out on everything from social inequality to goal celebrations, scored twice and sent the hosts, France, packing in the quarter-finals. The French played better and had more of the ball – just as they were supposed to – but those relentless Americans somehow found another level to close out the game. As France’s Amandine Henry explained: “I don’t think we’ve ever dominated the US that much. But still, dominating them still isn’t the same as winning.”When England came next in the semi-final, their coach Phil Neville conjured up what would be dubbed “spygate” as a new psychological roadblock for the US. A couple of US operations coordinators had scouted the hotels for the final round, including the one England were staying at, and Neville complained it was bad etiquette, another example of American arrogance.Making matters worse, Rapinoe, who scored all the USA’s goals in the knockout stage, had a minor hamstring injury and couldn’t play against England. Christen Press replaced her – and Press scored within 10 minutes. Naeher, who was supposed to struggle in her first World Cup, saved a penalty. If the US were supposed to lose, they clearly hadn’t gotten the memo.By the time the US reached the final, the talk around the team had shifted sharply. Maybe the Americans weren’t lacking quality, weren’t going to he distracted and weren’t falling behind – perhaps the US were just as good as they seemed all along.After seemingly everyone had given into the idea that the US were the real deal, the Netherlands finally gave the Americans a tough challenge. After scoring within 12 minutes of kick-off in all their games so far, the Americans had to wait until the 61st in the final, a credit to the Dutch players’ organization. But, thanks to goals from Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle, the Americans were World Cup champions once again.It certainly had a different feel to their previous World Cup victories. No one was paying attention in 1991, when the US won the first-ever Women’s World Cup. In 1999, the victory was a cultural phenomenon that changed the game’s landscape forever. In 2015, it was relief after waiting so long since the 99ers’ big moment.But this one? This was different. There were so many reasons they shouldn’t have lifted the trophy – the burdens on and off the field were much more than most teams ever have to cope with. But then they went ahead and won the World Cup anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ebf5f486d676807a5eee8b04b400dc84a42b94/0_56_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2c88d4d51bff04d15b6060e525ce3e","title":"no ticket to ride trapped without passports zimbabwe","story":"With the registry office facing a backlog of 280,000 applications, some people have waited close to a year to work or study abroadEvery morning for the past two months Eldah Makuvise, 35, has braved the cold winter mornings to queue for her passport at the local registry office in Harare, Zimbabwe. Each time she’s been sent away in despair.Makuvise’s application, like others submitted a year ago, is stuck in a huge passport backlog.Zimbabwe’s passport office has seen an influx of applications as economic woes push more people to search for work in other countries.The registry office can only process 50 passports a day. It has bemoaned the lack of foreign currency available to import paper and is now faced with a backlog of 280,000 applications.The Zimbabwe human rights commission has begun inquiries into the delay of passports and national identification documents following a public outcry.Makuvise and her friend, Moreen, 30, have resorted to taking turns sleeping in the queue to better their chances of being served the following day.Makuvise’s hopes of working in South Africa are slowly fading.Millions of Zimbabweans left the country over the past two decades of economic mismanagement by longtime leader Robert Mugabe.Things have not improved under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power in a military coup in 2017.Mnangagwa, who promised a “new dispensation”, ran into challenges in his first year in office. The possibility of getting a bailout loan from international financial institutions remains a distant dream because of human rights violations.The return of the Zimbabwean dollar is expected to worsen the economic situation as it remains weaker against other currencies, including the US dollar.Applicants in need of medical attention abroad have also borne the brunt of passport challenges in Zimbabwe.Cleopatra Arufandika, 45, is due a major operation in India in the next month, after suffering a hip dislocation.Accompanied by her son, Marlvin, she hoped her predicament would persuade the authorities to fast-track her application. But Arufandika was turned away.“I am in pain and my hospital booking is in a month. My family have already spent a lot of money on treatment. All I want is to get better,” Arufandika says.Arufandika has been pleading with the authorities and hopes for a better response at her next appointment.The passport situation has also dashed the hopes of students wishing to study abroad.Taurai Dyanda, 18, who was due to start at university in China in May, has called on the government to expedite travel documents for students.“I applied for my passport in September last year ,but almost a year later nothing has come. I have already missed the May intake and I’m forced to plead with my sponsors,” Dyanda says.“I won a scholarship to study civil engineering and I don’t think it’s fair for young people to lose opportunities like these.”Hopes are also fading for Thelma Ndebele, 22, a prospective medical student.“I should have gone to school in February and I have been turned away from the passport office for the fourth time. Now they want me to give an extra ZWD 53 to improve my chances of getting the passport, which cannot be guaranteed. I cannot continue to stay here while my friends are studying,” Ndebele says.The government this week admitted that they are facing a backlog dating back to July 2018.Home affairs minister Cain Mathema has promised to improve the process within a month. He says the Treasury has purchased new machines to print travel documents at a cost of nearly $600,000 (£480,000).“We can promise that within the next four to five weeks we’ll be able to produce 3,000 passports a day. The president had to intervene.

Dr Mathew White, who led the study, suggested that a sense of tranquility could be key. Starting your day with a coffee in the garden, or even near an open window, is a simple way to inspire calm. Going outside during your lunch break or spending a few minutes looking at the night sky before bed are other ideas.Leanne Manchester of the Wildlife Trusts encourages people to take a closer look at plants, trees and even weeds. “Stop to watch bees buzzing around flowers. There’s life everywhere, but it is so easy to miss it instead, slow down, stop and notice it.” Claire Francis of the charity Sensory Trust says: “Getting outdoors and connecting with nature needn’t involve a five-mile hike.” Jo Phillips, a director of the Forest School Association, suggests looking for “five beautiful things” to engage your senses. “It could be a flower, the clouds, lichen on trees, or the natural light.”Getting off the bus a stop early or going for a walk during breaks at work are simple ways to increase exposure to nature, says Manchester. If you’re walking with someone, Phillips suggests pointing out elements that have caught your eye, especially if you are with children. “Looking after the planet needs to become a priority, so we should do everything we can to ensure the parents of the future have memorable experiences in nature, so they can pass on that knowledge to their children.”With more than 62,000 urban green spaces in Great Britain, one should never be too far away. The Wildlife Trusts has a searchable online map of its nature reserves, almost all of which have free entry it also provides a list of accessible nature reserves. Greenspace, a downloadable layer in Ordnance Survey maps, is said to be Britain’s most comprehensive catalogue of green spaces for leisure and recreation.“For those who can’t get outside, bird boxes close to a window can provide interest all year round, as can growing and nurturing plants on a windowsill,” says Francis. As part of the Wildlife Trusts’ 30 Days Wild campaign, a pack has been designed to help care home residents feel closer to nature. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds holds its Big Garden Birdwatcheach year, at the end of January.This involves spending an hour observing birds – and you can even do it from a window with a good view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/566b862da1866cda4151c8e11888aa1c3ae59ac4/0_198_5011_3008/master/5011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea91405daa9e5b6c387c349796a6f758","title":"how to wash your hair shampoo conditioner","story":"It’s a myth that washing your locks frequently is bad for your hair. But how often should it be done, and what’s the best way to use conditioner?The biggest myth is that washing your hair frequently is bad, but there is no real rationale for that. You take your hair everywhere you go it picks up dirt and pollution, and you’ve got sweat, oil and dead skin cells. You can wash it every day if you want to. You are not stripping the natural oils from your hair, because they do not travel from the scalp down the hair shaft, especially if your hair is damaged or colour-processed. Physiologically, all hair is the same. The difference is in the shape of the strands.Although there has been a trend for washing only with conditioner, generally you do need to use shampoos. They contain a surfactant, which is designed to hold in dirt and oils that can then be rinsed from the hair.Get your hair thoroughly wet. If you wash your hair twice and the shampoo seems to lather better on the second time, it’s because your hair is properly wet. A 50p-sized amount of shampoo is enough for most people. Wash the scalp rather than the hair and allow the suds to run down. If you are washing your hair every day, you do not need to shampoo it twice. If you are washing twice a week, or if your hair gets very greasy or you use a lot of styling products, you might want to do it a second time.Afro hair is more susceptible to damage and dryness, but you can wash it as frequently as suits your hair – at least once a week. If you have short hair, you may not need conditioner, but if your hair is longer, you should use it, particularly if it is colour-treated. Conditioner hydrates and smooths down the outer cuticle, but just put it on the mid-lengths and the ends.Zoë Passam, trichologist at Philip Kingsley, was speaking to Emine Saner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895eda76e57980bcd583ebd46be37f73ebf3b495/0_40_4178_2508/master/4178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96528c251b0f255484830a9f59b80ca4","title":"barbra streisand hyde park london review","story":"Hyde Park, LondonShe may have to read her jokes from a screen, but Streisand has charisma to burn and the hits, when they come, are fantasticHer appearance in Hyde Park is not only the first time Barbra Streisand has played in London in six years, she informs the audience. It’s the first time she’s performed an outdoor show in 52 years, since she gave a New York concert called A Happening in Central Park, a title presumably given for reasons of modishness rather than its resemblance to the other happenings staged around the US in the Summer of Love: it’s hard to imagine anyone was tripping on LSD and rattling their love beads while Streisand belted out Happy Days Are Here Again. She was, after all, the breakout star of The Other 60s, when Broadway and light entertainment rolled on as if the Beatles had never happened, a “nutty little kook” who could do the lot: sing, act, and entertain an audience with Jewish comedy between songs.Six decades on, she needs a little help with the latter. A vast teleprompter pumps out not just the lyrics, but the script for the on stage anecdotes, including directions as to when she should put on a British accent, although if her spontaneous asides aren’t spontaneous, at least they’re funny: “My driver asked me if I went to the Pride parade yesterday. Why would I go? I knew I would see everyone there here tonight.” In the intervening years, she’s dallied with mainstream pop, although you get the feeling that’s not where her heart lies. Tonight, she compacts all of it – her cover of Laura Nyro’s Stoney End, her pounding duet with Donna Summer No More Tears (Enough Is Enough), the songs Barry Gibb wrote for her fantastic 1980 album Guilty – into one brief medley, which gives her more time to sing Silent Night. This is a pretty weird thing to sing in the middle of July, but, as anyone conversant with the aforementioned Happening in Central Park knows, she has form when it comes to unseasonally launching into carols: she sang Silent Night there, too. You could argue that it’s evidence she remains on brand half a century on: still kooky after all these years.She seems more comfortable knocking out Sondheim and Second Hand Rose: “Second hand poils, I’m wearing second-hard coils.” Her own coils tumbling over a hot pink Zandra Rhodes gown, she sounds largely fantastic: should anyone in the crowd be wondering what havoc the ravages of time can potentially wreak on someone’s voice, there’s a guest appearance from Kris Kristofferson as proof. Streisand talks as much as she sings, duets with Lionel Richie on The Way We Were and at one point cedes the stage entirely to Broadway star Ramin Karimloo, which the audience take surprisingly well given what some of them have shelled out to be here. “How do you get to be in the front rows?” Streisand asks, to which the answer may well be: I remortgaged my house.But they don’t seem to mind: they’ve paid to be in proximity to a legend, and she’s here, at least most of the time. And when she sings Send in the Clowns, you’d forgive her almost anything: it sounds heart-stopping, tear-jerking, whatever superlatives you want to throw at it, a reminder that some legends are legendary for a reason."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ad2085ce50df2b12ffd7f26600451ab7670ded/0_59_3496_2097/master/3496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0f061eaf33de4b28d2aceed3daa706","title":"froots british folk magazine underground music","story":"For 40 years, the magazine was a guide to Britain’s pulsating underground and a champion of thrilling weirdos. Its closure leaves a chasm in the grassroots music sceneWhen much-loved magazines fold, tributes quickly gush about how they captured new trends or scenes. But some magazines, like fRoots, have always sat outside time. A champion of the local and the international underground for over 40 years, it announced its closure last week after advanced discussions with a new publishing company fell through an official statement online added that “decreased advertising support in the digital age, along with current political and economic uncertainties” hadn’t helped.Take a look at its recent 40th-anniversary edition: it’s like a huge fanzine created by a groovy uncle, occasionally gazing at the mainstream but much happier exploring the margins. Its going out guide is staggeringly broad, revealing a fertile UK festival and gig scene rarely covered by the national press. Features include a dig into Kate Bush’s traditional roots, reports on the qawwali ensembles of Pakistan and a free desert festival in Morocco, plus Scottish folk musician Alasdair Roberts celebrating new artist Burd Ellen’s songs about women. The huge reviews section takes in London’s Cafe Oto, Korean experimentalist Park Jiha and Topic Records’ 80th-anniversary CD. Trendy bells and whistles are few, but it’s a rich treasure trove.fRoots began in 1979, at the height of post-punk and disco. Back then, it was The Southern Rag, a regional quarterly for central and southern England celebrating folk and roots music. It took off. In 1984 it was renamed Folk Roots, going monthly and national on the newsstands with a booming subscription base.This sounds unusual for a decade so giddy on pop. “It was a glory time, actually,” says its editor of 40 years Ian A Anderson (he uses the A to distinguish himself from the man he calls the “one-legged Jethro Tull flautist”). A folk musician in the early 70s, Anderson played the first Glastonbury (Michael Eavis said “he saved the festival” by filling in for Marc Bolan), and later he became a record company runner, festival programmer and radio presenter, building connections across the industry.“The mid-70s saw punks getting turned away from the folk clubs, but by the next decade they were letting them in,” he explains. “That generation were also interested in world music and politics, and figures like Billy Bragg were taking folk in another direction.” And people have been into blues, jazz and roots music throughout all eras of pop culture, he says. “What’s been fashionable never bothered us.”This loyalty allowed Anderson to take risks. In August 2000, he put Robert Plant on the cover a month later, young female singer and accordionist Bill Jones followed both editions sold as well as each other. “That was when I realised buying fRoots is like going to a festival you love, where you don’t need to see the lineup. Our readership trusted us.”fRoots has championed artists early. Rhiannon Giddens had her first cover in 2007 as part of her band, the Carolina Chocolate Drops. Sam Lee was also supported long before his 2012 Mercury nomination. “It feels like one of the big trees has fallen,” Lee says of fRoots’ closure. “fRoots provided a real understanding of genres and community. Those years of acquired knowledge disappearing … we’re being left with an empty desert of Facebook comments instead.”What particularly irks Anderson is that fRoots ticks many boxes for Arts Council and other public funding given its unique contribution to the arts. But magazines don’t qualify. “We give artists a leg-up to audiences that are ready to lap them up and aren’t served anywhere else,” he explains. “I worry about what will happen without that leg-up. We came out of the grassroots, and 40 years later we’re still connected to it – who else can say that? I’ve always believed fRoots is part of a wider musical ecosystem, where everybody depends on everybody else. Without those connections, things fall apart.”With structured support from other public funds, or another publisher ready to recognise the loyal readership that kept it going for four decades, perhaps fRoots’ can flower again. Its fruits will linger with us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation.

This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut.

This a problem with the ethics of the inidual who carried out this particular leak,” he said.“If people start to want to leak confidential information, leaving aside whether or not it may be a criminal activity, it certainly makes it much more difficult to be able to have the bond of trust within which we can operate in an optimal way.”Fox continued: “This is such a damaging, potentially damaging, event, that I hope the full force of our internal discipline, or even the law, will come down on whoever actually carried out this particular act.”The Foreign Office has ordered an inquiry into the leaking of the cables. Asked about the memos on Sunday night, Trump said: “The ambassador has not served the UK well, I can tell you that. We are not big fans of that man.”Hunt, speaking at a press conference at the Foreign Office, said he did not personally endorse the views expressed in the memos.He said: “It’s a personal view and there will be many people in this building who don’t agree with that view and indeed I don’t agree with some of the views that we saw in those letters.“I think the US administration is highly effective and we have the warmest of relationships and a partnership based on standing up for shared values.”Hunt added the basis for a successful diplomatic service was “the free exchange of information and opinions, and the understanding that we’re not always going to agree with each other but we want to know what people around the world are thinking”.Speaking to Today earlier Farage said the incident showed the need for “major civil service reform” and a purge of senior ranks to install officials more sympathetic to Trump and to Brexit.“I’m afraid with our civil service, our Foreign Office, everybody stayed in place, it was obvious to all that these were people who in many ways did not accept the results of those elections,’” Farage said, adding the new US ambassador should be “a retired business figure, something like that”.Farage said a future Boris Johnson government would be expected to remove the ambassador: “If you take Boris at his word, people like Kim Darroch simply shouldn’t be around.”Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary who is backing Johnson to succeed Theresa May, said Darroch was a “fine public servant” and resisted calls for him to go.Fallon told Today: “Happily, Nigel Farage is not appointing the next government. That would be entirely a matter for Boris Johnson, if and when he is elected leader of the Conservative party and is appointed prime minister. And my very clear understanding is he has not made any offers of jobs to anybody.”He added: “We should remind ourselves that ambassadors are paid to report fairly on the strengths and weaknesses of foreign governments, and there certainly were weaknesses when the Trump government originally came into office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45a3e9380deffedc3726db02995be0d8f2a25a8c/0_62_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72524aa77a69f9f8e17d6cea11a57f77 220w","title":"no deal brexit would be step into unknown says former bureaucrat","story":"Former Brexit department chief says leaving EU without a deal is not in UK’s interestThe public should be worried about a no-deal Brexit, the former top civil servant at the Department for Exiting the European Union has said.In his first interview since retiring three months ago, Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary at DExEU, said: “I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown.”He told the BBC’s Panorama programme that while Brexit planning in the civil service was in good shape, leaving with no deal, which is one of the options favoured by the Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson, would be “fraught with difficulty”.Panorama, which airs on Monday night, also revealed accusations that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, tried to silence the Road Haulage Association (RHA) over Brexit plans, and concerns in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) that Brexit could be an opportunity for recruitment by paramilitary groups.There were about 16,000 civil servants working on Brexit when Rycroft left his job before the first scheduled day of departure from the EU on 29 March.“It’s not in the UK’s interest to have no deal. It’s not in the EU’s interest to have a no-deal.”In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European court of justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘no deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Rycroft’s warning came as Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said it would be a “serious error” to assume no deal would not happen.One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces, he said, was “the boy who cried wolf effect, whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October”. He added that Northern Ireland’s economy would be seriously affected.The PSNI’s Brexit chief told Panorama that Brexit could provide a recruitment opportunity for the New IRA and other dissident paramilitary groups.“We know that the New IRA and other groups continue to recruit people and we believe that Brexit provides an opportunity for them to encourage people to recruit,” said Tim Mairs, an assistant chief constable of the PSNI.The New IRA said it was responsible for the killing of the journalist Lyra McKee earlier this year. It also claimed responsibility for a car bomb outside Derry’s courthouse in January and letter bombs sent to Britain in March. Its members murdered two prison guards, David Black in 2012 and Adrian Ismay in 2016.Mairs said he was concerned Westminister did not take the threat of smuggling seriously enough.Potential price differences between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland created by tariffs could create “new opportunities” for organised crime groups to exploit.Smuggling and counterfeit production of alcohol and cigarettes in Ireland has attracted criminal gangs from around the world.“We would see, traditionally, connections between some of those groups and more violent groups,” Mairs said. “The potential impact of a no deal on the economy in Northern Ireland is significant and that would, in our view, present potentially significant security concerns moving into the future.”Panorama, which broadcasts at 8.30pm on BBC1, also heard about a voicemail left by Grayling on the phone of Richard Burnett, the head of the RHA.Grayling told him: “I’ve got to say how very disappointed I am. I had intended to involve you closely in the planning over the next few months, but issuing a press release straight after meeting like that makes it much more difficult for me to do that.”Burnett said he felt Grayling was “trying to silence an industry that’s trying to help government, guide them”.He added: “My sense of that message was – either shut up or you don’t engage.”A Department for Transport spokesman said it continued to work with the RHA but it was “extremely unfortunate when details of private conversations held in confidence are made public in a press release”.The Irish cabinet will meet on Tuesday to discuss ramping up no-deal planning again with questions expected on how it could avoid infrastructure on the border while protecting the EU’s single market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c708c9ac871fe100524409afd57418e4f01f3de8/439_210_2787_1672/master/2787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=635757f88ebcdd28945caad6084d2216","title":"andy murray singles return tennis","story":"• Comeback continues at pace with positive doubles displays• Murray: ‘I’m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up’Andy Murray sees no reason he cannot still beat Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the champions who have been part of his own history, as he continues a comeback that looked out of the question six months ago.He is back where he feels most comfortable in the entire tennis landscape, the second week of Wimbledon – even if only in mixed doubles – and it has plainly whetted his appetite to drive on for a while yet at 32.Although his return after an absence of two years is now restricted to playing alongside Serena Williams, Murray believes he can compete again at the highest level in singles, the arena where he won his three grand slam titles, two of them at Wimbledon.“Why not?” he says, when asked whether he still felt he could beat the best of the past and the best of the future. “If someone can give me a reason why I shouldn’t be able to compete again then I would listen to it, but so far I haven’t really been given one.”What separates Murray from the herd is his single-mindedness. Throughout his 14-year professional career he has defied the odds and all expert opinion. He has invariably found a way.None of his serial physical blows seemed to have killed his love of the game, although he came perilously close to walking away after his hip pain kicked in brutally in the first round of the Australian Open in January. One final operation saved his career.It could hardly have been clearer from his demeanour on Centre Court on Saturday evening, when he and Williams laughed and smiled their way through an easy opening match, that he is convinced he made the right decision in carrying on.The next challenge is to break out from the relatively undemanding world of doubles, in the men’s and mixed, to test himself in singles again. That could happen in Cincinnati in September as a dress rehearsal for a full return to the heat of competition at the US Open, where he won his first slam title seven years ago.Much has happened since 2012 across the Tour as the rivals he grew up with have won their own struggles against injury and the ravages of time but Murray insists he can work his way back into that picture. “I know how bad I felt in Australia and how bad I felt the last year that I played singles here, and I feel better now than I did then,” he says.His last singles appearance at Wimbledon, when he hobbled through five sets against Sam Querrey in 2017, mirrored the trauma of the Roberto Bautista Agut match in Melbourne but, as far as Murray is concerned, those experiences have been parked in the past. He has survived them and learned from the consequences.“If, physically, I can get back to a good level my tennis is still fine,” he says. “I’m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up with guys. I don’t feel that the game has moved on and I won’t be able to get back. A lot of the same guys are still there.”It has been starkly illustrated in the first week here that the expected rise of the young contenders in the men’s game is still in its early stages, as, one by one, they have fallen. The sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, went out in the first round along with the seventh, Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by the Canadian teenager Félix Auger-Aliassime in the third round.A slew of prospects and established seeds have failed to reach the second week. From one side of the draw alone Kevin Anderson, last year’s finalist and the fourth seed, has gone, along with the three-slam champion Stan Wawrinka, 10th seed Karen Khachanov, 11th seed Daniil Medvedev, as well as Britain’s Kyle Edmund. Gone also, after a fighting exit on Saturday night, is back-in-form Dan Evans.On the other side of the draw notable casualties include Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner, Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Alex de Minaur. Still standing, of course, are Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, along with Kei Nishikori, the only top-10 players left.Murray, meanwhile, is determined to play his one remaining card for as long as he can, having lost in the first round of the men’s doubles earlier on Saturday. But did he not miss the cut and thrust of high-grade singles, though? Yes and no.“It’s just different, singles and doubles. There is a lot more self-analysis in singles. It’s your responsibility. The thing that is nice with doubles is that, when you win, you are winning with someone else and that is enjoyable.“At Queen’s, for example, we won the end of that final because of Feli. He played brilliant at the end of the match. So it is difficult to know how responsible you were for certain things. That’s the thing that is different about it that I am not used to as much.”For all that he is enjoying his mixed doubles experiment with Williams, there is a murmur beneath that strongly suggests he cannot wait to get back to being a champion again – on his own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28088639a6b83daad1542af9d4fbeae8a4e10f2e/0_96_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9504975b51604e542f19bdde8c92ee7d","title":"talking horses strike rate says frankie dettori better than ever at 48","story":"The Italian jockey could hardly buy a winner in 2013 but is back at the top of his sport and has the bookies running scaredOnly a tiny number of athletes are so good that they change the way the game is organised. In racing, Arkle is remembered for being so far ahead of his contemporaries that handicappers had to change their approach for races he was due to run in. Alongside him, we can now put Frankie Dettori, who is so talented and so popular that bookmakers have started to change the terms on which they accept wildly optimistic accumulators.Skybet and bet365 have restricted the number of Dettori-ridden horses that can be permed together. Coral accepted Dettori accas on Saturday only on the basis that the final two runners would be paid at starting price, not the morning odds. Other firms have limited stakes.I prefer my bookmakers to be a little braver, bearing in mind that they have been quietly salting away the stakes placed on such wacky bets for decades, but two factors explain why they’re ducking for cover just now. One, it might be 25,000-1 or bigger against Dettori going through the card on a major raceday but an increasing number of punters are throwing a few coins on it, just in case. Two, the Italian is so full of fire at the moment that it could really happen, again.Honestly, would you be surprised if he rode every winner at Newmarket one day this week? It would be impressive, but hardly unexpected, given the way he’s riding.Confidence has always been important to him and I don’t suppose he had much of it at that point. How different things are now, with nine winners from 14 rides over the past eight days, in which time he has won the Eclipse, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Prix Jean Prat and even found time to nip over to Siena to watch the Palio.Even the stewards appear to be in his thrall. With the safety of his fellow jockeys in mind, I do hope there will be no repeat of the interference he was allowed to get away with at Deauville on Sunday.At Ayr, he fields Hello Girl (2.30), who rewarded market support by scoring at Lingfield nine days ago. That was her first success since 2017 but it was only her second outing since switching yards and evidently a big run was expected. Today’s run has a flavour of ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’ about it but she’s only 4lb higher, is still in Class 6 company and gets fast ground again. It’s a big field but I’ll cheerfully take 9-2.More speculatively, Linda Perrett’s Retirement Beckons (5.00) could outrun odds of 14-1. He was a close fourth after pulling hard over a mile here in May and this shorter trip should help.At Ripon this evening, Tinkler has a fair chance with the 6-1 Flying Raconteur (7.10), an unlucky third on his handicap debut recently. An hour later, the nap is Sameem (8.10), returning to calmer waters after being well held in the Britannia. He’s nicely treated as the only three-year-old in a winnable race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21aa98ce940ef05f2c2d1904e5068b5e16024338/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ec8e2fea255a4aa9135aee7d6de184b","title":"tour de france stage three live","story":"108km to go: Elia Viviani of Quick Step is first of the bunch over the line at Dizy-Le-Gros, followed by Peter Sagan, who has already got his mitts on the green jersey in this Tour.

It’s also quite windy, so the very real threat of crosswinds has to be considered. 124km to go:  There’s been a change at the front of the bunch, where Tony Martin has decided he’s done enough work for the time being and has dropped back a bit.

It boasted one of the best finishes to a bike race you’ll see in yesterday’s Stage Three, when Marianne Vos of the Netherlands swooped to conquer Lucy Kennedy, who made the fatal error of sitting up in her saddle a milli-second too early when she thought victory was already hers. 144km to go: Tony Martin continues to lead the bunch, trying to control the gap to the five-man breakaway. The gap is 5min 38sec at the moment. The hills at the business end of today’s stage, which ends with a punchy climb, means it won’t end in a traditional sprint finish, which explains the reluctance of the rest of the bunch to do any work.

Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan will become artistic directors this November, replacing Sarah Frankcom who is leaving to run the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.In a joint statement, Weise and Shanahan said they were excited to “make work with and for the people of Manchester”. They also praised the way the Royal Exchange has been transformed under Frankcom’s leadership: “She has reimagined the relationship that artists and audiences have with this theatre, championed their voices and celebrated the democracy that the Exchange’s unique space allows.”The in-the-round theatre is situated in a building that was once the world’s largest cotton exchange. As the Royal Exchange’s current associate artistic director, Shanahan knows its theatre and studio spaces inside out. She staged Maxine Peake’s drama Queens of the Coal Age at the Exchange last year and is directing its adaptation of Wuthering Heights in 2020. Shanahan has also directed plays at the Crucible in Sheffield and Soho theatre in London.Weise is best known for directing The Mountaintop, a play about Martin Luther King, at the Young Vic, and for Nine Night, Natasha Gordon’s debut  about a Jamaican funeral wake. It opened at the National Theatre in 2018 and became a West End hit. He is an associate artist of London’s Donmar Warehouse.Both Weise and Shanahan are recent recipients of awards for emerging talent. The Royal Exchange’s executive director, Stephen Freeman, described them as “innovative creative thinkers” with “a drive to deliver theatre with the broadest possible reach”.Frankcom, who shared the theatre’s artistic directorship with Greg Hersov for several years before taking sole charge, said: “My tenure has been about championing next-generation artists, so I’m absolutely thrilled that Roy and Bryony will now shape and lead the Royal Exchange.

Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there’s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music.There’s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic.They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses.If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that’s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are.In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity.The one thing the Frames can’t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple’s popular AirPods.The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video.The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google AssistantSiri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you’re talking to yourself.Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pauseplay or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this.To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they’re missing is volume control, so you’ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame.You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm.The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It’s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses.The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm’s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose’s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.The Frames know which way you’re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears.But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential.For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs £400 while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about £100.Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you’re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out.They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music. And when you do switch them on they sound surprisingly good, with rich audio that sparkles with the right track. There’s simply no comparison with bone conduction or similar other non-earbud personal audio technologies.Listening to your tunes while still being able to hear the great outdoors while sitting in the garden or park in brilliant sunshine is thoroughly enjoyable. Trying to listen to a podcast while travelling on London’s noisy Piccadilly line, not so much.So the Frames will never be the only set of headphones you need, and they could do with a battery in the case, volume controls and a few more styles, not to mention prescription lenses and some killer Bose AR apps.But even at £200 the Bose Frames are the most interesting piece of wearable technology I have donned since the original Google Glass.Pros: music without blocking your ears or making a racket for others, look good, choice of lenses and frames, comfortable, sound good, solid Bluetooth connection, excellent call qualityCons: no battery in the case and only 3.5 hours between charges, will never be your only set of earphones, can’t protect from noise of the outside world, AR potential unrealised This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But don’t panic. These hacks, says Susie Mesure, can help you become a time lordWho doesn’t dream of having more hours in the day to get stuff done? Sadly, until quantum scientists figure out how to reverse time, we’re stuck with having to manage with what we have.Trouble is, the world of time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming. There are so many different techniques and systems, from sophisticated activity logs and minute-by-minute scheduling, to synchronised software and apps.Luckily, there are a number of quick and easy life hacks and mental tricks to help blitz your to-do list.A key thing is to try to be aware of the value of each passing moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says Ellen Hendriksen, host of the podcast Savvy Psychologist and author of How to Be Yourself: “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on because that is time spent not only on doing that task, but on not doing other tasks.”Another way to make yourself more aware is to first picture in your head your ideal working day – epitomising optimum levels of productivity and downtime. Then compare it to how your actual day is panning out. This will you give an idea of how and where you’re falling short.Kelsey also swears by limiting interruptions from telephone calls or emails using your travel time efficiently not overcommitting yourself and curtailing the time spent in meetings. He also suggests keeping a diary so you can spot where you might be going off-piste. Another, obvious, tip is to delete any social media apps from your phone – we all know they’re like catnip, and a quick scroll can easily cost you half an hour.Hendriksen suggests slimming down to-do lists to include only small, specific tasks. “If we are staring at 10 huge things, especially a large number of non-specific things, such as ‘clean the house’, ‘finish project’ or ‘figure out work presentation’, then those large tasks will seem overwhelming. So keep your to-do list to more defined things.”Other simple techniques include tackling trickier or more boring tasks first, like ticking off your business admin, so you finish them faster.One – arguably masochistic – tip is to replace your clock with a timer – even an hourglass or egg timer – to make your deadline feel more menacing. Or, if that sounds too stressful, use the stopwatch app on your phone and challenge yourself to speed up each time you do something repetitive.Another approach to time management is to focus your mind not on the value of each passing hour, but rather on the value or importance of each task. Indeed, self-help types often reference a matrix, based on a quote attributed to US president Dwight Eisenhower: “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.”Stephen Covey, in his 1989 book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, says the matrix comprises four boxes: urgent and important not urgent but important urgent but not important and not urgent and not important. The idea behind it is straightforward: by thinking about where your task sits within the quadrant, you should be better able to notice whether or not you’re wasting your time.Kelsey points out that it can be helpful to think of time management as something to continually struggle with, rather than as something that can be mastered or cured. “It’s worth noting that I wrote these books from the perspective of being a sufferer, someone who struggles with issues like time management,” he says.Whatever your business, don’t keep knocking essential tasks to the bottom of your to-do list.Tailor your business insurance with AXA. It couldn’t be simpler. That’s one less thing to worry about, and more time to spend getting on with business.

The holders, New Zealand, begin their campaign against their main pool rivals South Africa the following day while England’s first match is against Tonga on 22 September in Sapporo. The final takes place on 2 November at the 72,327-capacity International Stadium in Yokohoma.What is the format?There are four pools of five teams with the top two advancing to the quarter-finals:Pool A: Ireland, Scotland, Japan, Russia, SamoaPool B: New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, Namibia, Canada\u0026nbspPool C: England, France, Argentina, USA, TongaPool D: Australia, Wales, Georgia, Fiji, UruguayHow do you get a seat?Tickets went on general sale on first-come, first-served basis on 19 January via www.rugbyworldcuptickets. There are 1.8m tickets available across the tournament and so far more than 4.5m applications for tickets have been received via the respective ballot phases, making Japan 2019 the most popular Rugby World Cup to date. Japan, England, Ireland and New Zealand matches are in most demand.A limited number of tickets are currently available via the general ticket sales phase.There are also official supporter tour and hospitality options available for fans around the world – see www.rugbyworldcupsupportertours and www.rugbyworldcuphospitality. Overall, 400,000 international visitors are anticipated over the six-week period, delivering a record economic impact for an event in Japan, and a Rugby World Cup, of £2.97bn.Despite the growing popularity of fashion tattoos, including among young Japanese with no yakuza connections, cultural resistance is proving hard to break down, with onsen owners citing objections from other bathers.Last September, World Rugby, the global game’s governing body, warned players and supporters to keep their tattoos covered when visiting gyms and pools to avoid causing offence.The All Blacks, who have a huge following in Japan, are among the teams that have said they will comply.Tattooed or not, first-time onsen users are being encouraged to follow a few simple rules to ensure their Japanese communal bathing experience is memorable for the right reasons. Bathers should rinse their bodies before getting in the bath. And remain naked at all times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92f0067bccbf91cbfc635e849b38da93edb9e1f/0_219_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54beea1637f30c76bbd9ceb2a5508eb0","title":"judge reinstates madrids ultra low emissions zone","story":"New rightwing council fails to reverse policy of former mayor Manuela CarmenaBarely a week after Madrid’s rightwing council began rolling back the city’s low emissions zone, a judge has ruled that the traffic restrictions must be maintained.As of Monday, drivers of non-exempt vehicles will once again be fined €90 if they enter the 1.8 sq mile zone in the centre of the Spanish capital.Madrid’s new city council, which is led by the conservative People’s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party and backed by the far-right Vox, announced moves to begin rolling back the Madrid Central zone days after taking office in June.Greenpeace, Ecologists in Action and other environmental groups appealed against the decision to abandon the scheme, and a judge in an administrative court ruled in their favour on Monday, saying pollution in Madrid could not be allowed to rise uncontrollably.“The judge’s ruling not only accepts our plea but also suspends the agreement the council reached on June 27 to abandon the scheme,” said Paco Segura, a coordinator of Ecologists in Action. “Madrid Central is now operating just as it was before.”The city council tweeted: “The moratorium on sanctions in Madrid Central decreed by the city council has been temporarily suspended on the order of the court of administration.”The council, led by José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said it would appeal against the decision, claiming the moratorium was perfectly legal. The council has three days in which to present its case.The perimeter of Madrid Central is monitored by 115 cameras.

File photograph: Andrew MatthewsPA Wire A group of Irish telecommunications companies has accused eir of “tactical interference” in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) process, and said its actions could be open to legal challenge.Alto, an umbrella group of Irish telco companies including Sky, BT and Verizon, made the claim in a letter to Minister for Communications Richard Bruton, and also accused eir of interfering in social policy.Industry sources suggested the most likely party to initiate such a challenge would be National Broadband Ireland (NBI), the preferred bidder for the process.The NBP aims to deliver high speed broadband to up to 520,000 rural premises in a project that will cost up to €5 billion, with an anticipated €3 billion coming from the exchequer in the form of a subsidy. NBI was appointed preferred bidder for the project after a controversial tendering process which saw both eir and Siro, a joint venture between Vodafone and the ESB, drop out.There was more controversy later when the disclosure of meetings between then minister for communications Denis Naughten and David McCourt, who led the NBI bid, led to Mr Naughten’s resignation. The plan was also strongly opposed by Robert Watt, the secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who said it was poor value for money. Most recently, eir’s suggestion that it could deliver the same outcomes as the NBP for a fraction of the cost caused fresh controversy, although the Government remains committed to the plan.Responding to the letter, a spokesman for eir said the company “was not trying to interfere in a public procurement process, we were responding to a question from an Oireachtas committee,” adding he was “surprised that Alto are against transparency”.The letter is copied to secretaries general of the Department of Communications and Department of the Taoiseach, as well as Hildegarde Naughton, the chair of the Oireachtas communications committee.It accuses eir of risking an “untold” impact to the NBP through its recent claims, which were made first two weeks ago at a meeting of the Oireachtas Communications Committee.It says it is “critical” the other telecommunications are able to “support an NBP process where consumer choice and equal treatment are at the forefront of the planned intervention”.“Alto has very significant concerns about eir’s intervention and apparent attempt to reopen the public procurement process having previously withdrawn,” it says.“The behaviour of a dominant player such as eir, tacitly interfering in a social policy measure that is pro-consumer and pro-competition and recognises the need to protect the State (and taxpayers) investment could have untold reputational and distortionary market impacts if the Government decides to either pause or scrap the NBP intervention as a consequence.”It also described eir’s intervention as “entirely hypothetical” and suggested other companies could make similar statements based on “entirely hypothetical models”.It also says Mr Bruton’s officials “highlighted that the alleged financial delta between a concrete and compliant offer and one that is vague and non-compliant is substantially less than claimed by eir and crucially came with materially favourable terms to eir to the detriment of consumers, retailer operators and taxpayers”.“Industry does not want, and cannot have, an NBP provider without the type of organisational governance and independent legal separation outlined in the procurement process. Indeed, it would be fair to characterise this as a ‘red line’ issue for industry on which the State relies so much to ensure a successful NBP achieves its objectives. ““The Minister should also note that NBI and eNet are not members of the Alto group. Alto is however extremely concerned that if the Government were to further delay the process, that the NBP intervention will not only stall permanently but runs the risk that significant damage will be done to Irish telecommunications investment community observing that a process could be derailed by such a late, arbitrary, noncompliant and unsubstantiated offer from an external stakeholder whose commercial interests are probably best served by such an outcome.“Without prejudice to the views or position of any of our members such an outcome may also give rise to litigation. Further, the wrong decision here will create a perception that the Irish State is a soft touch when it comes to compliance with State Aid rules, competition, and public procurement rules. We do not believe that the latest intervention by eir is credible in any event.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3950192.1562589722!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jp mcmanus on board private jet during emergency landing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSources close to Limerick horse racing philanthropist JP McManus have confirmed the father of three was on board his private jet as the airplane made an emergency landing at Shannon Airport on Sunday. File Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSources close to Limerick horse racing billionaire JP McManus have confirmed the father of three was on board his private jet when the airplane made an emergency landing at Shannon Airport on Sunday.The billionaire was one of five people on board the Gulfstream G650 jet, which reportedly experienced engine trouble as the aircraft cruised over the Irish Sea.Operating under the call-sign Emerald 006 the aircraft began experiencing difficulties a short time after departing from Shannon Airport, Sunday afternoon.The crew declared an emergency on board while flying over the Irish Sea and turned around prior to entering UK airspace.The crew issued a Pan-Pan distress alert, which is less serious than a full May-Day emergency, requesting permission to return to Shannon.The jet routed towards a holding point over Co Clare where the crew circled for a time going through check lists and trouble-shooting the issue.The crew confirmed a left engine failure and told air traffic controllers there was a possible issue with the jet’s second engine.ResponseOn the ground at Shannon, a routine emergency operation swung into action involving the local authority fire service, National Ambulance Service, HSE and An Garda Síochána.Shannon Airport fire and rescue crews were also deployed to designated holding points along the main runway.Mr McManus’s jet landed safe around 7pm, and, accompanied by airport fire crews, was able to taxi under its own power to the Westair Aviation hangar.Mr McManus was later seen exiting the Westair Aviation base and walking to his private helicopter which flew him to his home near Kilmallock.Mr McManus’ €55m jet, acquired by the Limerick man in 2014, is based at Shannon Airport and operated by Westair Aviation.A reliable source said Mr McManus had “no comment” to make about the emergency landing.“He’s home at the moment, after he flew home on the chopper,” they added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3949995.1562566604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to ramp up no deal brexit preparations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government will this week launch another wave of no-deal Brexit preparations. Photograph: Pavel GolovkinAPThe Government will this week launch another wave of no-deal Brexit preparations.It will urge State agencies, Government departments, businesses and the public to prepare for the likelihood of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union on October 31st.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will bring three memos to Cabinet on Tuesday dealing with various aspects of no-deal preparations. Sources briefed on their contents say there is a need to shift preparations for a British crash-out into a new gear, as officials increasingly view a no-deal exit as a likely outcome.Effectively, officials will begin a countdown to a no-deal exit, which will take place – in the absence of agreement between the UK and the EU, or another extension – in 115 days from today.Sources concede the Government will be faced with questions about how it reconciles the twin objectives of maintaining no Border infrastructure while protecting the single market, though it is not expected that the memos this week will offer definitive answers to this vexed question.It is expected that Ministers will be briefed at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting on the threats to the all-Ireland economy and especially to small businesses in the North, in the event of no-deal.One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces, he adds, is “the boy who cried wolf effect . . . whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October.”“To assume this would be a serious error,” says Mr Coveney.He reiterates that the Government will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and strongly defends the backstop. This is the mechanism that was designed to ensure a seamless Border on the island of Ireland after the UK’s departure from the EU.However, Mr Coveney also concedes that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the backstop will disappear in which case the all-Ireland economy will be in particular danger.The Dáil is due to debate the Government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit on Thursday, before the summer recess.Meanwhile, Conservative leadership contenders Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have made clear that they would leave without a deal on October 31st if there is no renegotiation of the agreement and the Northern Ireland backstop in particular.With little prospect of meaningful exchanges between London and Brussels in August, sources on all sides acknowledge that a no-deal countdown will be well under way by September.MPs at Westminster could use a Northern Ireland Bill on Monday to block Mr Johnson from suspending parliament to force through a no-deal exit in October – something which he has threatened to do.What will happen to the North?Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve said the Bill, which would delay Stormont elections while powersharing talks continue, is a legitimate mechanism to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal.“Northern Ireland and Brexit go rather closely together. The chances are, if Brexit goes through – a no-deal Brexit – it is going to be the end of Northern Ireland’s union with the United Kingdom, with serious political consequences flowing from it,” he told the BBC. “That’s a Bill that is a perfectly legitimate place to start looking at how one might make sure no-deal Brexits are fully debated before they take place.”The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill would delay the need to hold an Assembly election until October 21st, with the option of a further extension until January 2020. It would also give civil servants more clarity about what decisions they can make in the absence of an Executive.With parliament due to go into recess on July 25th and the current extension expiring on August 25th, the government hopes to pass all stages of the Bill on Monday.Armagh-born Labour MP Conor McGinn has tabled an amendment that would oblige the British government to introduce same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions have not been restored within three months.

While the Government’s position was that they did not expect the government led by Theresa May to crash out, the same clearly cannot be said of the next British government. Both candidates to lead it, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt (Johnson is the overwhelming favourite) have said they will leave on October 31st if there is no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement - something the EU and the Irish Government have repeatedly ruled out. On Tuesday, the Cabinet will consider plans to intensify Irish preparations for a no-deal outcome. While the EU has said that it will take unilateral, sector-by-sector action to protect itself - such as measures to allow British planes to stay flying to EU airports - huge uncertainty remains. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is on the Irish Border, where both sides have set out positions which are inherently contradictory. The EU has said it will have no hard border, but will protect the single market, while the UK has said it will leave the single market and customs union but will not have any hardening of the Border.How these positions can be reconciled is unclear. But what is clear is that a no-deal Brexit will involve very significant economic disruption. Here are some of the ways it will affect you: The economy would grow more slowly“The UK is deeply integrated with the European Union and its decision to exit from this trading block has no parallels in modern history,” the ESRI noted in a detailed survey of the economic literature on the economic effects on a no deal Brexit. Overall, it expects that if the EU leaves without a deal, the size of the economy would be five per cent smaller than it would otherwise have been. If that seems manageable - and it is over the longterm - it still involves billions of euros less in tax receipts and spending on public services. There would be an immediate hit to consumer confidence, slowing spending in all sorts of areas, thus slowing the economy further. Even if this technically wasn’t a recession, it would feel like one. Budget implications Paschal Donohoe has suggested the Government would not introduce an emergency budget to take account of a no-deal Brexit, but the economic effects would inevitably be felt on budgetary policy in the years ahead. In simple terms, giveaways like major tax cuts would almost certainly be off the table, while spending increases in areas like health and social welfare would be in question. Pressure would also be felt on capital budgets, as they are politically the easiest thing to cut when the Government finds its finances under pressure.The return of tariffsIf the UK leaves without a deal, its membership of the single market and the customs union will end. That means that tariffs will be due on goods entering the EU from the UK, and vice versa. Standard World Trade Organisation tariffs can be as high as 50 per cent on beef, for example - having a disastrous effect on Irish exports to the UK. In addition, there would be an explosion of bureaucracy required to administer cross-Border trade. Businesses which export to the UK have been urged to register with customs authorities, but many have so far failed to do so.Other Border checksIt’s not just tariffs, though. Checks on product standards for goods entering the EU single market will also be required, and these are especially onerous on food products. Trade in food products between the EU and the UK - which make up a huge proportion of Irish exports - would be severely disrupted. Inevitably, some businesses will go bust, and unemployment will rise.Overall, economists at the ESRI have estimated that there would be a projected fall in Irish goods exports to the UK of 31 per cent , while UK goods exports to Ireland would decline by 28 per cent. Agricultural and food products, textiles and traditional manufacturing sectors would be most severely affected, they say.Some products will not be availableThough it is hard to say exactly which products will be affected, supermarket supply chains are likely to be severely disrupted if a no-deal Brexit occurs overnight. While some businesses have been making plans to source products from elsewhere, some shortages are inevitable. According to a paper by economists John FitzGerald and Edgar Morgenroth, two-thirds of the products on our supermarket shelves are made in the UK or come through there.Prices will rise The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) has warned that the lowest income households could see a 4 per cent increase in their average annual household spend, which is equivalent to a €634 annual increase. Moreover, households in the lowest income group could face a 70 per cent higher increase than those in the highest income group, largely due to the higher share of household expenditure accounted for by food by lower income households. Wages could dropAt the same time as prices are going up, wages, particularly for low-skilled workers, could be adversely affected, ICTU has warned. As part of its no-deal planning, the Department of Enterprise has estimated that by 2020, low skilled workers could suffer a drop in wages of 3.9 from the baseline, no-Brexit scenario. “It is likely that low-paid workers would be most affected by Brexit-driven price increases,” ICTU says.The value of sterling is likely to declineSince the 2016 referendum, sterling has declined as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit - once thought remote - has grown. This has made life difficult for exporters to the UK, as their products have become more expensive. Those difficulties would be compounded if the UK crashes out. A weaker sterling has made cross-Border shopping more attractive, and if sterling weakens more, the allure of cheaper goods in the North will widen, hitting businesses in Border areas. And while it will be cheaper for people from this State to travel to the UK, the Republic will be considerably more expensive for British tourists. Extra charges for online shopping with UK retailersDoing business with the UK will not just be more difficult for businesses - it will be more difficult for consumers, too. A hard Brexit could mean higher costs for goods bought online from Asos, Amazon or any other retailers based in the UK. Any item that costs more than €22 and comes from outside the EU is now liable to VAT, and any item over €150 is also liable to customs, chargeable on some products - notably clothing. As a non-EU country, these charges would become automatic on trade with the UK.UK car imports will be decimatedBringing used cars from the UK will become much more expensive as purchasers will be liable for VAT at 23 per cent. This would wipe out the financial attraction for inidual purchasers and for dealers buying cars in the UK to sell them on in the Republic.Return of roaming chargesThe EU ban on roaming charges will no longer apply to the UK. While Irish mobile operators have said that they will not apply roaming charges to people travelling to the UK, British operators will be free to apply charges to people who come from the North to the Republic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

(Photograph: Louisa  GouliamakiAFPGetty ImagesKyriakos Mitsotakis has been sworn in as Greece’s prime minister after his centre-right party regained power with a sweeping general election victory, raising hopes of a return to growth and stability in a country rocked by years of recession and three international bailouts.The conservative New Democracy party captured 39.8 per cent of the vote and 158 seats in the 300-member parliament. Syriza, the leftwing party of Alexis Tsipras, took 31.5 per cent and gained 86 seats, according to near-final results.Mr Mitsotakis was expected to announce his cabinet later on Monday. The US-educated McKinsey alumnus and son of a former Greek prime minister said he was cancelling parliament’s normal summer recess in order to begin legislating key reforms, including tax cuts, measures to reduce red tape and attract investment, and a scheme to reorganise the prime minister’s office.The election result was a heavy blow for Mr Tsipras, the one-time radical firebrand who abruptly reversed his policy stance and adopted a harsh austerity programme in return for an €86 billion bailout after Greece came close to crashing out of the euro zone in 2015.While the economy stabilised under the Syriza government, structural reforms lagged and growth targets were missed after the finance ministry raised taxes and slashed public spending to achieve the annual primary budget surplus agreed with Greece’s bailout creditors.Mr Tsipras gambled by calling a snap election to rally left wing support after Syriza finished 9 percentage points behind New Democracy at the European Parliament elections in May. But voters dismissed the prime minister’s warnings during the campaign that a conservative government would slash wages and social benefits, and sell state-owned assets at low prices to foreign investors.Varoufakis returnsGreeks have also been angered by the way that high tax rates have eroded middle-class incomes while unemployment is stuck at about 18 per cent, the highest in the eurozone.While yields on Greek bonds have fallen dramatically in the past few months, the economy is growing more slowly than forecast and investors remain wary.On Monday morning, the yield on benchmark 10-year debt touch a new record low, down by as many as 14 basis points to 2.014 per cent. The Athens General stock index was 1.6 per cent lower on Monday, led by declines in the financial sector, following a strong rally in the run-up to the poll.Greece is still under close surveillance by the bailout creditors, with a backlog of structural reforms yet to be carried out. Bailout monitors from the EU and IMF are scheduled to arrive in Athens in the next few days to review progress amid concerns that a €1.4 billion package of handouts by the Syriza government before the European elections would derail this year’s budget targets.Yanis Varoufakis, the maverick finance minister during Syriza’s early months in government in 2015, returns to national politics as leader of Mera25, the Greek arm of his European anti-establishment movement Diem25. The new party won 3.4 per cent of the votes and nine seats.Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi party backed by many impoverished rightwingers at the height of the Greek crisis, was excluded from parliament after narrowly failing to reach the 3 per cent of the vote threshold for entering parliament. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus.“We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”.The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  Parachutist sustains injuries after landing on roofMay has \u0026#39full faith\u0026#39 in Sir Kim Darroch and won\u0026#39t apologise to Trump for ambassador\u0026#39s attack on \u0026#39inept\u0026#39 US president Comment: The alarming spread of postal voting threatens to undermine our democracyMother sues NHS for £200,000 claiming hospital failed to inform her of son\u0026#39s Down\u0026#39s Syndrome diagnosisLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowIran enriches uranium past cap and warns only 60 days to save dealSouth Korean citizen makes a rare defection to the North Congolese warlord Bosco \u0026#39Terminator\u0026#39 Ntaganda convicted of crimes against humanity by ICCComment: It is not the role of British business to advocate against BrexitDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Facebook tip-off about illegal rave in Norfolk leads police to shut it down - 20 hours later Shard climber reaches 95th floor without harness as police deny giving daredevils \u0026#39carte blanche\u0026#39 to climb landmarksGreek conservatives score landslide election win as country rejects austerityNHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"geeks become new jocks british universities now have gaming","story":"E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universitiesGetting a place on a university sports team used to be a ticket to social prestige. But it appears that geeks have become the new jocks, as British universities now have more competitive gaming teams than any other sport.For the first time there are more students taking part in “Esports” than football, according to figures compiled and British Universities and College Sport (BUCS) and  National Student E-sports (NSE).Esports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universities. There are 685 Esports teams spread across 73 universities in the UK, compared to 662 football teams.The next most popular sport is hockey with 546 teams, followed by netball with 432 teams and then Rugby Union with 425 teams.Jon Tilbury, director at NSE which organises inter-university gaming tournaments, said that while university gaming societies have been around for 15 to 20 years, it is only in the past five years or so that they rapidly increased in popularity.Some societies now have hundreds of members, he said, and certain universities have separate societies for particular games.For the first time there are more students taking part in “Esports” than footballMr Tilbury said that the surge in interest from university students echoes the growth in the gaming industry more generally. “Interest in Esports has been there for a long time,” Mr Tilbury said. “The wider Esports community has grown massively, with professional teams paid big salaries and flown around the world to be in tournaments . “What we see is a lot of university students with technical skills getting involved, we have students who have developed their own custom software.”Some universities, which have a particular enthusiasm for gaming, have different societies for particular types of games, for example, Warwick University has a Nintendo Society as well as an Esports Society. The average university Esports team consists of 6.5 players, according to data from NSE. Around 90 per cent of players are male, 70 per cent of them are studying courses in STEM subjects.Mr Tilbury explained that inter-university games can be played by students from the comfort of their own bedrooms, but players would meet up in person for the final of a tournament.The NSE co-ordinates with BUCS, the umbrella organisation that organises sports matches, to ensure that gaming matches to do deter students from playing other sports, he added.   The most popular reason students cited for competing in gaming championships was making and maintaining friendships, and improving and becoming a better player, according to a survey by the NSE.Parachutist sustains injuries after landing on roofMay has \u0026#39full faith\u0026#39 in Sir Kim Darroch and won\u0026#39t apologise to Trump for ambassador\u0026#39s attack on \u0026#39inept\u0026#39 US president Comment: The alarming spread of postal voting threatens to undermine our democracyMother sues NHS for £200,000 claiming hospital failed to inform her of son\u0026#39s Down\u0026#39s Syndrome diagnosisLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowIran enriches uranium past cap and warns only 60 days to save dealSouth Korean citizen makes a rare defection to the North Congolese warlord Bosco \u0026#39Terminator\u0026#39 Ntaganda convicted of crimes against humanity by ICCComment: It is not the role of British business to advocate against BrexitDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Facebook tip-off about illegal rave in Norfolk leads police to shut it down - 20 hours later Shard climber reaches 95th floor without harness as police deny giving daredevils \u0026#39carte blanche\u0026#39 to climb landmarksGreek conservatives score landslide election win as country rejects austerityNHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hope prix pictet 2019 photographic competition shortlist selection","story":"The Prix Pictet competition carries a prize of 100,000 Swiss Francs (about £80,700).

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”May has \u0026#39full faith\u0026#39 in Sir Kim Darroch and won\u0026#39t apologise to Trump for ambassador\u0026#39s attack on \u0026#39inept\u0026#39 US president Comment: The alarming spread of postal voting threatens to undermine our democracyMother sues NHS for £200,000 claiming hospital failed to inform her of son\u0026#39s Down\u0026#39s Syndrome diagnosisLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowIran enriches uranium past cap and warns only 60 days to save dealSouth Korean citizen makes a rare defection to the North Congolese warlord Bosco \u0026#39Terminator\u0026#39 Ntaganda convicted of crimes against humanity by ICCComment: It is not the role of British business to advocate against BrexitDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Facebook tip-off about illegal rave in Norfolk leads police to shut it down - 20 hours later Shard climber reaches 95th floor without harness as police deny giving daredevils \u0026#39carte blanche\u0026#39 to climb landmarksGreek conservatives score landslide election win as country rejects austerityNHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedJeremy Hunt challenges Boris Johnson to rule out handing Nicola Sturgeon more tax powersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 8 july 2019","story":"One of the eagles catching a fish.

He reportedly wanted to live close to where his parents were buried.  According to the North Korean state-run Uriminzokkiri website,  Mr Choe said it had been the “will” of his parents that he “follow” them to the reclusive kingdom to work for its unification with South Korea. Despite a recent diplomatic thaw between North and South Korea during ongoing talks on nuclear disarmament, the two countries still remain technically at war and separated by a highly fortified border after a truce, and not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War.Defections are more common in the other direction, and fraught with risk for North Koreans who choose to try to escape via China and Thailand. South Koreans still need permission to visit the North and Mr Choe had done so successfully 12 times since 2001, including for his mother’s funeral in 2016. The pensioner is not a public figure and his decision to defect is likely to make little impact on relations between Pyongyang and Seoul. While highly unusual, it is not a major political coup for the North. His parents’ defection decades earlier made much bigger political waves. His father Choe Tok-sin had served as foreign minister of South Korea in the 1960s before emigrating to the United States in the 1970s. He was a strong critic of Park Chung-hee, South Korea’s military leader, and he and his wife, Ryu Mi-yong quickly became members of Pyongyang’s political elite when they moved there. South Korea’s ministry of unification confirmed the latest Choe family defection on Monday, adding that the government and intelligence authorities were investigating the situation. The ministry said it was realistically impossible to check every movement of South Korean citizens, reported the Korea Times. It is difficult for the government to keep updating the whereabouts of an inidual citizen, ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min said.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

And I’m going to swing by and take a dump in your garden and decapitate a thrush.There are few more selfish people than cat owners. If you can’t keep your cat confined on your own property, don’t have a cat.And isn’t it about time we started fining cat owners when they fail to pick up after their pet has defecated AS you probably gathered, I don’t have too much time for Jeremy Corbyn.He’s a dimbo who buys all the adolescent, far-left stupidity. Policies which were dated decades ago.But I am totally on his side when it comes to his battle with the civil service. Someone within that smug organisation leaked an official “worry” that Corbyn was “too frail” to carry outThat was cruel, spiteful and politically motivated.The civil service is against Corbyn because they don’t agree with his policies. Well, me neither. But the civil service is there to carry out the bidding of WHOEVER we elect, even Magic Grandpa.The problem is that the civil service is heavily biased, just like the BBC. Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

Create a separate veterans department for the first time to coordinate their needs across Whitehall, run by a minister who attends Cabinet,. Enshrine the Military Covenant into law to allow vets and bereaved families a way to hold the Government to accountthey suffer disadvantage,. Pass new legislation to end unfair and repeated investigations into historical allegations before the next General Election.The call for the two wannabe Prime Ministers to sign up to the pledge is also backed by ex-Army senior Tory MPs from each of the two men’s campaigns.Writing in The Sun today, ex-Royal Artillery officer Johnny Mercer – a prominent Boris backer – brands it Britain’s “GI Bill moment”, named after the time when America finally decided to do good by its Vietnam War veterans.Mr Mercer adds: “It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.”Hunt supporter Richard Benyon, a former Green Jackets officer, said: “The change of leadership is a very important opportunity for us to reboot what Government should be doing to protect our veterans.“The Veterans Pledge is the right way forward.”Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction.But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to Armed Forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases.They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.Help for Heroes CEO Melanie Waters said: “We have supported over , wounded military personnel and their families so far and the need is growing, which is why we are calling on the leadership candidates to sign up to the Veterans’ Pledge.“Many wounded veterans feel let down by the system and we know more needs to be done by the Government to ensure our heroes get the fair deal they deserve.”Eighteen years of almost constant war fighting since the   terror attacks in areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have taken a huge toll on troops.Last year alone, there were , medical discharges from the UK’s Armed Forces,  of them for mental health conditions.It emerged yesterday that almost  vets a day are now seeking help for mental health issues.A recent King’s College London study revealed , former servicemen and women are still suffering from their physical or mental injuries from the modern wars of the past  years.The pledge’s unveiling comes as outgoing PM Theresa May today makes the final speech of her Premiership to the forces to thank them.On a visit to Permanent Joint headquarters, Mrs May will say: “There is no greater responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our people.“And doing so is not something any Prime Minister can achieve without you.“You are not just a part of British le – you are the guarantors of British le. The foundation of our freedom. The protectors of our democracy. And for that, we owe you a debt of gratitude.”I have no ties to any particular charity, no agenda in this field — except a point-blank refusal to accept poor care of vet­erans and their families.Make no mistake — Help for Heroes, the Legion, The Soldiers Charity, SSAFA and more deliver world-class services.But there is no doubt they need help. The pathways are still too unclear.Not all charities spend their money in the most effective way.Access to service records remains a nightmare.The Veteran’s transition from military service to a civilian GP is still entirely postcode-driven.The Military Covenant is not applied equally. If a local authority does not believe in it, then it does not apply.Similarly, hundreds dragged through the historical allegations process have no clear support.The new PM must seize the nettle and create a small, dedicated unit in the Cabinet Office.This is our GI Bill moment, a chance to emulate the US treatment of its veterans.Our Government has not led in this sector for too long. In this change of administration, I want a change of attitude. Enough of the warm words and intentions.The Sun and our major care-givers today demand a tangible commitment to do by our veterans our duty we should have done some years ago.It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.EVERY time you think they can’t sink any lower, Labour’s leadership finds a way.This once great party is now run by a rabble of apologists for anti-Semitism, Marxists and bullies.They think nothing of spending their members’ cash on expensive law firms in an attempt to throttle the free press.And when it comes to policy, their combination of two-faced doublespeak on Brexit and a cripplingly expensive nationalisation programme would send the UK economy into a nosee it might never recover from.Yet still there are decent MPs on those Labour backbenches who think the tide will turn, that evenCorbyn was to enter Downing Street he could somehow be managed.

Talliston is very much the real world, Mr Tarrow told The Sunday Times.

The documentary will also feature an interview with the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, Philip Rycroft, who told BBC Panorama that a no-deal Brexit is something the public should be worried about.    Mr Rycroft said: I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation.

The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK.

He said there are around , civil servants whose jobs are dedicated to Brexit-related issues, in what he calls an unprecedented situation and the biggest exercise across Government weaposve seen over the last few decades. He added: The planning I think is in good shape, absolutely... but of course what that doesnapost mean is that there wonapost be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship.

MPs joined the call for terms to be staggered as a Mirror probe revealed the cost of a holiday can rocket by over £, in August. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: “It’s not right that kids’ education is being used to exploit hard-working parents.” A government shake-up of the school holiday system is being demanded with families paying up to % more for sunshine breaks once kids are on leave. The Mirror found the great summer holiday rip-off will yet again burn a massive hole in family budgets as prices can rise by more than £, in August, compared with early July when children are still in class.    Cross party politicians and family organisations want an end to the sky high prices that hammer millions of hard working Brits who save up for their only sunshine break of the year with the family. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\" The travel industry yesterday defended the rocketing costs of the foreign package breaks and also called for the Government to re-draw the school timetable and stagger holidays. Teaching unions said school attendance is vital for children and instead said the Government should focus on the travel companies. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner criticised so - cal led “dynamic pricing” for penalising parents.    She told the Mirror: “Eye-watering, rip off holiday prices mean many families choose to take their kids out of school or simply don’t get a break at all. “It’s not right that children’s education is being used to exploit hard-working parents in this way.” Conservative MP Steve Double is campaigning on the issue and fighting the Government’s strict policy that fines parents who take children out of school for a sunshine trip abroad as it is the only affordable option. Department for Education figures show the number of penalty notices for pupil absence has rocketed by % year-on-year with unauthorised family holiday absence accounting for .% of the cases. Between -, parents were fined £ million for taking kids out of school without permission with fines ranging from £ to £ for those not coughing up within  days. His stand comes as Mirror research found a family of two adults and two children aged  and seven can expect to pay £, for a self catering holiday to Marmaris, Turkey heading out of Gatwick on July  for two weeks.    By comparison, the same apartment at Club Anastasia in the same location from the same airport with the same holiday company Thomas Cook costs a whopping £, when flying out on August  - a rise of %. And a family of four planning a two week self catering trip to Zante, Greece faces the temptation of taking the break in term time as a fortnight at Alykes Garden Village, Alykes costs £,. from July - compared with a % hike to £,. from August - when flying out of Liverpool John Lennon Airport with Tui. A spokesperson for industry body ABTA said: “If school holiday dates were staggered, this would help to alleviate sharp peaks and spread demand over a longer period of time.” Travel firm Thomas Cook added: “We have suggested and are supportive of staggered school holiday dates by region to help reduce the pressures of peak holiday demand.” Single parents’ group Gingerbread said solo mums and dads were hit with a double whammy of soaring prices and missing out on family deals aimed at two adults with kids.    Head of membership Anant Naik called for holidays to be tailored to meet the needs of dferent family groups and said: “We all know that the price of holidays shoots up when the school term ends, meaning many families simply can’t afford to go away. “This is compounded for single parents, as not only is there a price hike but any deals offered by holiday companies typically apply to a family with two adults. “One in four families in the UK is headed by a single parent and excluding them from holiday deals simply isn’t fair. Not only does this penalise single parents and their children but it’s also short sighted on the part of holiday companies. “Holiday companies need to wake up, catch up and offer deals that are available to all types of families.” Mr Double said the number of parents fined in his St Austell and Newquay constituency has soared from just four in - to  in - and he slated the fines. He said: “We have a situation where parents who, for perfectly legitimate reasons, are unable to take a family holiday during the school holiday period are subject to an arbitrary tax imposed by the local authority for taking their children out of school.”    COMPARE THE MARKET     Thomas Cook AIRPORT: London Gatwick Destination: Club Anastasia , Marmaris, Turkey, self-catering Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £, Thomas Cook Airport: Newcastle International Destination: Sunwing Resort Fanabe with Siam Park , Costa Adeje, Tenere, all inclusive Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £ Thomas Cook Airport: London Gatwick Destination: Oasis Park , Costa Dorada, Spain, all inclusive Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £ TUI Airport: Liverpool John Lennon Destination: Alykes Garden Village , Alykes, Zante, Greece, self-catering Dates: July - Cost: £,.

Zabrina Radford suffered pain in the ear neck and back of her lower skull so went to see the doctor in  when she was  and was diagnosed with a benign tumour. Doctors wanted to remove it but they were unsure of the type she had and couldnapost guarantee saving the surrounding nerves. They said she had had the tumour since she was just nine years-old. Zabrina underwent gamma kne, a non-invasive treatment which uses radiation to treat the area, and went for MRI, CT and PET scans every year to check the tumour hadnapost grown.    It hadnapost been giving her many problems but in November , on the run up to her th birthday, she had pain down the right side of her face. In March last year the mother-of-two underwent surgery to clean up an infection and cut away dead bone. When Zabrina, of Maulden, Bedfordshire, came round from surgery doctors told her the devastating news the right side of her face was paralysed because her facial nerves had shut down.  Zabrina said: I had a feeling the problem was to do with my brain tumour because of the surrounding nerves. We lost a dear friend over Christmas in  and I had this feeling that  would be a dficult year. I was booked in for an operation on March , . It was mainly to clear up infection and cut away dead bone from osteoradionecrosis, which is the death of bone due to radiation, but things were much worse than they initially thought.    When I woke up the next day the doctors told me the nerves had completely shut down and that the right side of my face was now paralysed.It was a massive shock to me to just wake up one day and not be able to smile. Imagine not being able to smile at your husband or children and seeing the worry on their faces. It was heart breaking. Iaposd just turned  and le was fantastic for us, two handsome and smart sons and my husband, who I simply adore, had been working so hard on his business to give us a good le. Le was good. I was fit and healthy and confident. My le changed so suddenly.    Doctors performed surgery on Zabrina on June ,  to remove the tumour and help reconstruct the right side of her face so that she can one day smile again. Iaposve already had one major eight-hour surgery on June ,  to finally remove my tumour,  years later, and help aposreanimateapos my face, Zabrina said. After two weeks of having this operation Iaposm able to smile a little again and itaposs simply the best feeling in the world. I still have a long way to go but hopefully in the next nine months my facial nerves will work normally. Iaposm feeling very positive and excited.

Alyssa Kirk, , had breast enlargement surgery in  in a bid to boost her confidence. However, six months after surgery, her health started to rapidly decline, with Alyssa claiming the implants were soon ruining her le. The mum-of-four says they caused her to suffer severe pain, memory loss and fainting. She ended up bed-bound for months despite doctors dismissing her claims. Alyssa, from Brisbane, Australia, is sharing her story for the first time to raise awareness of the risks that may come with implants. She underwent surgery in June of this year to remove them - and now says: The past three years have been horrendous.    I always planned to have a boob job when I was finished having children so when I had my fourth child, Indianna, then one, I got an uplt and breast enlargement. I breastfed all of my children and it made my natural breasts appear saggy, I was a C and went up to a F with implants. I wanted them to make me feel confident but instead I felt fuzzy and faint - my memory was so bad I thought I had dementia. I would be searching the house high and low for something like my bank card and then realise it was in my hand. I felt like I was going insane, my mind was muddled, my face would go numb and I had no colour at all. People said to me that I looked like a aposwalking corpseapos and I agreed, I would randomly faint and had no energy. Iaposve lost count of how many times I visited the doctors I had every scan and test possible including ECGs, thyroid checks, CT scans, MRI scan and they all came back perfectly fine.  I was terried and frustrated that I had no answers despite over  doctor appointments. Alyssa refused to believe what the doctors had said as she was getting sicker by the day - she physically couldnapost look after her children Cohen, , Cameron, , Liam,  and Indianna, . She reached out on social media and found multiple women with breast implants and were experiencing the same symptoms. Stay at home mum, Alyssa adds: I read posts from girls who were being dismissed from the doctors despite being chronically ill like myself. It became clear that the breast implants were the cause - I spent over £ [,] butthey were left in any longer they could have cost me my le. Every day I was terried that I might die, my health was getting worse by the day causing me to have severe anxiety and panic attacks.

The former sexual health and counselling referrals advisor says she had tried almost every diet going but nothing seemed to work.    Katrina added: I even became a runner for a while – but while I raised £, for the Wallace and Gromit’s Children’s Charity I didn’t lose any weight for me and I began to thought I would never be able to do. My health was suffering – I was st lb at my heaviest – and I had so many reasons to motivate me to lose weight But two years ago Katrina finally got the push she needed when her son was almost badly hurt. She said: My youngest son Brandanwas three when he ran off and ran out into the road. I was terried and tried to run out to get to him, but I wasn’t fast enough – because of my weight.    It’s a busy road but, luckily, there were no cars coming. Had there been it would have been a very dferent story and it shocked me. I thought I can’t look after my children like this, my weight is holding me back. And it’s not just affecting me anymore, it’s affecting my children too. A month later she took out a loan to have drastic weight loss surgery. Katrina said: I know some people say it is cheating, but it isn’t. I have still had to re-educate myself in terms of healthy eating and portion control – although I do sometimes think thatI knew before what I know now, I might have been able to do it without it.    After researching nutrition I know a lot of my problem was hormonal, it was a constant biological battle, caused by production of ghrelin and leptin which control how hungry and satisfied a person is – or isn’t – and the imbalance of those and blood sugars depending on the types of foods you eat, andyou have a starchy and simple carb-heavy diet. Katrina, from east London, had a gastric sleeve fitted, which has removed  percent of her stomach. The busy mum said: The operation was scary because it’s a big deal, and yet exciting – but it pushed me into educating myself. I had to eat smaller portions and use smaller plates – before I would pile food on my plate and I had big dinner plates – I had to eat more mindfully, especially just after the surgery, but now too as, over time, it becomes less restrictive.“If I eat too fast or too much I feel sick or get hiccups .   It was hard to adjust after surgery because I was still wanting to eat the same in my head, and you get what you call buyer’s remorse where you wonder what in earth you have done. But, very quickly, as you feel better, become more energised, your clothes become looser and you get used to what you are eating, you realise how good you feel and that it’s the best decision you’ve ever made. She has also had to overhaul her diet, switching to complex carbohydrates, leafy greens and salads to regulate and improve her gut health. Before breakfast was toast or a sugary cereal followed by a snack of crackers and fruit. Lunch was sandwiches and crisps with a cereal bar afterwards, and dinner was meat, potatoes and vegetables – and lots of it.    “Then I’d have a sandwich and, because that was so nice, a couple more. Then I’d have pudding, perhaps cake or half a packet of biscuits or giant cookies – and of course I’d buy the packet of five because they were only £.” Now breakfast is a green smoothie, fruit or home-made sugar-free granola with natural yoghurt. Lunch is a salad or chicken or roasted chickpeas with salad, and dinner is chicken with salad or vegetables, or fish. All meals are homemade and healthy, and she rarely eats processed foods.  Any snacks are high protein such as cheesecake made with a nuts and seeds base and cream cheese and raw honey topping, or a couple of Babybel cheeses. Now, weighing jst stone lb, Katrina no longer has aches and pains in her knees, hips and back which forced her to use a cane indoors. She also has loads more energy and has even reversed problems like bulging blood vessels behind her eye, which were discovered during an emergency hospital visit for a tear in her retina and could have damaged her sight just before she had the operation. Karina said: I have got my health back, I can move. And now I’m the mum who plays in the park and goes for walks, not the mum who sits on the couch and watches TV, and even my kids – Katrina also has a son Kai,  - have noticed that.  Having focused on my eating I’m now going to concentrate on my fitness and do more exercise. I’m enjoying what I’m doing and I’m loving my le now. The surgery has saved it. But thereaposs one thing Katrina still would like in her le - love.

Terry Meredith, , from Uley, Gloucestershire, has the perfect hideaway that is completely hidden from view from the ground. It is five metres high and his own personal paradise that seats  people, with two beds and a central BBQ. The grandad-of-six originally planned on cutting down the willow tree in , but he was taken away by the unbelievable views at the top and decided to build a tree house retreat instead.  After forking out £, for materials, and doing all the work himself, the tree house is supported by four trees overlooking the Welsh Hills, Cotswolds and the Malvern Hills. Terry, a business owner, said: The willow tree at the end of my garden had grown so big that it was blocking the sunset. I was going to reduce the tree by cutting half of it down but when I climbed up, my jaw dropped, I couldnapost believe the incredible view was just  metres away from my house. I was wowed by the welsh mountains, Cotswold escarpment and a stone age fortress Uley Berry.  I wanted to share this amazing view with my family and friends, and now six years on, even strangers come in to take a peek. He continued: I was an electrician but I am good at carpentry, so it wasnapost too hard for me to build the tree house. It took about eight months to build and I did most of it on my own with some help from friends here and there. It is the perfect place to watch the sunset, to hang out with family and have a laugh, I love it.Terryaposs tree house has also become a hot spot for locals.  He added: Once I received a message from a local lady who askedshe could celebrate her th birthday in the tree house with some friends. I was flattered and said aposabsolutely, as long as I can joinapos we had a fantastic night, with a steak cooked on the BBQ and some drinks. It was like a pop-up restaurant it makes me happy that other people can enjoy my tree house as much as I do.

Once the Queen dies , there will be a -day period of national mourning. When the dust settles on that thereaposll be a few signicant changes which will take many members of the public some getting used to.After all, having been on the throne for  years, sheaposs the only monarch the majority of us have known. We know the national anthem will change to God Save the King, itaposll be His Majesty rather than Her Majesty, coins and bank notes will have to be redesigned as will the cypher on post boxes, but thereaposll be some dramatic shts within the Royal Family too. . Prince Edward gets a new title Now this is an unexpected development.  Prince Edward, aka the Earl of Wessex, is one of the more low-key royals and he was not given a dukedom when he got married to Sophie. The couple also decided against their kids being styled His or Her Royal Highness, but instead had them styled as the children of an Earl.However, Edward not getting a ducal title wasnapost a snub - itaposs because itaposs believed heaposll be created Duke of Edinburgh after both Charles’s accession and Prince Philip’s death, PopSugar reports.. What on earth will Camilla be called  Will Camilla be Queen Consort  A lot of the British public donapost feel positively about that.    Interestingly, Charles wonapost be the first monarch to have to solve the conundrum about what to title their spouse. Back at the start of the Queenaposs reign, the Duke of Edinburgh went through a period of not actually having a title. He was an HRH, but not a Prince. Heaposs been the Duke of Edinburgh since , but heaposs not a Prince Consort like Prince Albert was. Keeping up  No, us neither.  With Camilla and Charlesapos complex romantic history, the question of what sheaposll be titled remains unanswered. Technically she is the Princess of Wales at the moment, but has never used that title . So would she go with the title of Queen Consort  Watch this space... Essentially, what all of this demonstrates is how bizarre and complicated being a royal is. . Thereaposs a new Prince of Wales Another downside of being royal is,you want a promotion, someone has to pop their clogs first. This is not an HR problem the rest of us have .  So, the Queen dies, Charles becomes king and that means thereaposs a job opening for the position of the Prince of Wales. As Charlesapos heir to the throne, this goes to William, who will also become the Duke of Cornwall, the Duke of Rothesay and heir apparent. .  Kate can finally be called a Princess This is a funny one, because for so many of us Diana is absolutely synonymous with the title of Princess of Wales - hence Camilla not using it.

Russian scientists unraveled the mystery behind Ancient Egyptaposs hair fashion, leaving mummies with immaculate curls lasting thousands of years. Using state-of-the-art technology, researchers were finally able to reveal the pharaohs secret hair balm serum. The special formula contained beef fat, castor oil, beeswax and pine gum, with optional aromatic pistachio oil.    The Ancient Egyptians applied the serum to their hair, leaving them with perfectly preserved curls lasting over three centuries. Scientists believe the hair formula contained a dferent ingredients than those applied to their bodies.  Dr Viktor Pozhidayev, a senior researcher at the institute’s biotechnology and bio-energy department said: “We carried research on three Ancient Egyptian mummies. All dated to the first millennium BC. “It was astonishing to see their long hair being so meticulously styled, with no lock out of place.    “We had the idea that special embalming compositions were used for their processing, and decided to find out their recipe.” Researchers used mass spectrometry to discover the ingredients which had dissolved overtime, recording infrared spectrums before and after treatment with solvents. The results showed the hair balm contained beef fat, castor oil and beeswax. Further studies showed the presence of abietic and dehydroabietic acids - found in pine tree resin.  Two out of three of the mummies had fragrant pistachio oil present in their hair balms. The study was published in the Journal of Analytical Chemistry. The discovery was made as part of a large-scale research conducted on mummies at the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. Using modern technology, including positron emission tomographyand computer tomography, scientists were able to analyse the mummies without breaking their cocoons.  Scientists were able to study the skeleton of a mummy who had lived over , years ago, and found that two of his feet were missing. Sergey Kartashov, of the Kurchatov institute, said: “On the computer screen we can see that some parts of body are filled with objects that were inserted during the mummication process. “These are likely to be fabric rolls, and possibly some ritual accessories. “The mummy has both feet missing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mandla maseko man set first","story":"NewsMandla Maseko: Man set to be first black African astronaut dies in road crashMandla Maseko, , was killed on Saturday in a motorbike accident, according to his familyShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMandla Maseko had beaten a million other entrants from  countries to be selected as one of  people who would travel to space \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man set to be the first black African astronaut has died in a road crash.

Now police have launched a national search to track them down, with an arrest warrant being issued for the fugitive mum. The boy’s father, Sergiy Fedirovich Bakyrey, , told The Advertiser   that they went missing while he was away working. He said: “I am very worried about Thomas’ welfare as his disappearance was without any warning and I do not know where he is.    “I know Thomas was very much looking forward to seeing me...and that he will be distressed about where I am and why he has been taken away from his home.” Extensive searches to find the pair have so far been unsuccessful and fears are growing for Thomasapos welfare.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

An interim evaluation took place in December  with minor changes being implemented in January  to address some minor issues.ldquoA more detailed evaluation was conducted in April  which provided useful feedback from students, staff and parents from all nine high schools.ldquoThe vast majority of respondents highlighted the importance of having access to a library for reading, digital, research and study.ldquoThe feedback has been analysed and options for realising the decision of previous council to identy savings is ongoing.ldquoIt will also be critical to ensure that future library provision needs to be equitable across the authority.To which councillor Anderson: ldquoFor Galashiels Academy this has not been a good experience.

Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up

existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost

said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

For some, their memories may be shaped by the time they attended Sunday School this was very popular with more than  attending in the s and s.The Sunday School was headed by Matt Patterson, assisted by Annie McSporran, and the Bible class for teenagers was led by Bob Craig in the s.The extended church building and the arrival of Jonathan and Angela Sharples in the mid-s saw the start of a toddler group, called Jellytots, which became well known to many parents and carers throughout the community.#After I retired, I was involved in the toddler group, along with Pauline Guntripp,# said Felicity Kelly. #It was a happy group, giving parents and carers the opportunity to relax with other adults while the little ones played safely.#When Iain McCallum was pastor of the church, a children’s group – the Rainbow Club – started on a Tuesday evening, with music, activities and crafts for primary school children. The music was provided by Gordon Cosgrove and Katrina Barr.For some, it will have been the youth groups that gave a point of contact with the church. These have existed under ious names – CHAOS with Sam and Jon Philips, Youth Fellowship run by Sian Galbraith and, currently, SKY , led by John Ives and the present pastor, Steve Davies.These have given young people a place to meet together and explore the Christian faith.Steve Davies indicated that the event planned for Saturday evening will aim to blend together three elements: #a historical flavour, a strong musical focus and a thanksgiving celebration#, and he added that there will be a chance to reminisce over refreshments and enjoy a display of photographs showing activities and events of days gone by.A church outing in the s.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

The first floor has a lounge and kitchenette, plus a second en-suite bedroom.The document continues: ldquoNigel has Parkinsonrsquos disease meaning that the new home will need to be designed to accommodate specic requirements in this regard.ldquoThe floor plan is designed to be accessible at all levels with the provision of a lt and wide hall and doorways.ldquoHeight, light and bright is what is achieved in this scheme along with an element of lsquowowrsquo everywhere one looks."},{"url":null,"title":"driver-given-asbo-for-his-cars-loud-exhaust","story":"Officers were in patrol in Haddington town centre last month when they spotted a vehicle with a modied exhaust.It was deemed to be ldquoexcessively noisy.PC Charlie Duncan told the townrsquos community council: ldquoThe vehicle was stopped and the driver was issued with an anti-social behaviour order and advised to have the exhaust amended accordingly."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-wallyford-railway-station-opened","story":"Opened on June , , it now handles about , passengers per year or just under , each week.John Yellowlees, from Prestonpans, a retired ScotRail employee who is now an honorary rail ambassador for the company, was at the opening and has shared his diary entry from the day with Courier readers this week.It read: ldquoThe .

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making. Itrsquos certainly an inclusive event.Therersquos even a hugely popular vintage farm machinery section, a huge draw for farming and non-farming visitors alike and which makes an impressive vista across the showground.Butyou think itrsquos all about prize turnips and tractors, yoursquod be wrong. Such is the reputation of the Haddington Show it attracts some prestigious performers.One of the most sought-after tickets is for the remarkable pop-up opera shows: a touring version of Scottish Opera who perform in a mobile lorry, complete with seating and stage. Theyrsquoll be singing highlights from three operas during the show and tickets are on a first-come first-served basis on the day.Other notable entertainment is from the Broke FMX stunt motorbike team. Theyrsquoll be performing acrobatic stunts that will have the audience holding their breath as the UKrsquos top ranked freestyle motocross riders reach heights of  feet and jump gaps of almost  feet.For something a little less heart-stopping but no less thrilling, donrsquot miss The Drakes of Hazard.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement.

But it completely goes against the ethos.\"The person who made these comments has actually nothing to do with the Citizens Assembly. Shes not involved in organising it, shes not involved in any of the advisory boards. Shes just someone who has advocated for Citizens Assemblies because shes been inspired by the Irish example.\"Professor David Farrell of University College Dublin, research director on the first Irish assembly, also told the paper that perceived bias was ldquoa serious risk to the new project.He said: ldquoI think theres a serious riskthere isnt some buy-in from most of the parties that it could undermine it. Thats a serious risk.\"In both of the Irish processes, pretty much all of the parties were able to buy in - and in some cases quite reluctantly in the beginning. But I think that was so important.ldquoYou can see it with social media commentary already that there are people who are seeing this as a stitchup which is what you get early on. The best way to reduce that criticism is to say Look, we have some buy-in from all parties.\"We had much the same when we were talking about abortion because that would have been similarly an extremely controversial topic.\"So whats really important is that its seen to be independent, objective, fully transparent.\":Citizens Assembly hit by recruitment delay amid Unionist calls for boycottDr Escobar told the Herald: ldquoWhat I really want to highlight is that there is a distinction, and itrsquos an important distinction, between public leaders like Joanna, who are advocates and supporters for this kind of methodology for involving the public, versus those who are actually impartial organisers who will have the responsibility to deliver this important process, and shersquos not part of that.\"I donrsquot think that thatrsquos a distinction that has been made properly.ldquoItrsquos all coming out as an attack on Joanna. To be honest, you know, these things very rarely get visibility, these kind of alternative forums of democractic engagement.ldquoTherefore it is important that leaders like Joanna and others come into that space and speak to their own supporters, which I think is what Joanna was saying when she said she was hopeful this is going to help the path to independence.ldquoBut the problem is that there is a public perception that this is just an SNP thing. But actually the Assembly is going to be independent from government.ldquoItrsquos important we are not mixing those who are advocates and public leaders who are calling for this, because they hope itrsquos going to help in their own cause, but that is not necessarily the agenda of the assembly, and certainly the organisers are a dferent sort of group.He went on: ldquoI do think that comments like that, because there is no public perception of the distinction between Joanna and the people actually involved in developing the Assembly, I think itrsquos true that these comments at this stage can make things much harder for people to really find some legitimate ground the Assembly to do its work properlywith public trust.ldquoBut, Joanna, you know, in that sense I donrsquot regret saying that. It does make it harder, until it will begin to distinguish between those who are speaking about the Assembly and calling for it, and those who are actually going to deliver an impartial process.Askedhe was concerned he had been misquoted, he said: \"Speaking to the Scotsman I never mentioned Joannarsquos name, but obviously it was between the lines.\"I did say last week there were unhelpful comments that are making things ten times harder because we are not yet at the stage [of]a mature public conversation about what the Assembly could accomplishgiven the chance.ldquoIt just comes across as very personal, but then again Irsquom not that naive not to understand how things come out.ldquoUnless the Assembly has the trust of everyone across the ideological spectrum then itrsquos not going to work. Itrsquos important that people like Joanne speak up, but itrsquos just about understanding that shersquos not speaking up for ious assemblies, shersquos speaking up from her elected politician position and public leader position rather than anything to do with the actual delivery of the Assembly.\"I welcome contributions from politicians, but itrsquos just about how they choose to frame it.In a series of tweets this morning, Ms Cherry said she stood by her comment, and said it was part of the ldquojoy of democracy that others might disagree.However she also called for people to approach the Assembly with an ldquoopen mind.A short positive thread on #CitizensAssemblies #She told the Herald: \"Of course Irsquom always interested in independence. Thatrsquos hardly a revelation. But the Citizens Assembly is about looking at policy issues which interest everyone regardless of their stance on Independence. The remit at present is wide.\"There are all sorts of future challenges the assembly could look at. Having pioneered this exciting initiative it would be surprisingI wanted to undermine it and I donrsquot.\"If there is a threat to the integrity of the CitizensAssembly it comes from those boycotting it andmisrepresenting its purpose.

These are not bugs that glow in the dark.Using a mix of biotechniques and genetic breeding, the start-up develops high-performance strains of black soldier fly and selects traits such as protein content, growth rate, fat composition and temperature tolerance depending on clientsrsquo needs.The animal feed is then made from the highly-optimised fly maggots, helping to avoid environmentally damaging soy which has been blamed for deforestation and high carbon footprint.The black soldier fly larvae are particularly effective, thanks to an apparently insatiable appetite and astonishing ability to turn almost any kind of organic waste ndash from agricultural leftovers to faeces ndash into high-quality protein, helping to solve two environmental issues at once.While the fly larvae are currently on the agricultural menu, the start-up could also move into developing more efficient ieties of mealworms and crickets for human consumption, making the protein source more affordable.In the case of mealworms, laboratory adaption could help provide an alternative to environmentally devastating palm oil production ndash mealworms have been found to have healthy fatty acid properties similar to palm oil, but with the potential for faster and more efficient production.According to Farrugia, a key benefit of super insect-based animal feeds and fishmeal is that it has the potential to be produced in Scotland ndash avoiding the need to important soy-based feeds mainly from America.Meanwhile, there could also be spin-off benefits for healthier farmed products. ldquoFor example, more salmon are being farmed, and therersquos a need for more fishmeal, he adds. ldquoBut the limit for fishmeal is capped so each fish gets less, which means it takes in less Omega .ldquoWe now need to eat twice the amount of salmon now as we did  years ago to get the same Omega . So, wersquore looking at ways of adding Omega  to the insect product.The start-up, based at Edinburgh Universityrsquos Roslin Innovation Centre, is one of  businesses which was last year selected as part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos poundm challenge fund, Unlocking Ambition.Half were established businesses which have spent the past year being guided by mentors linked to Scottish Enterprise, while the remaining  young start-ups, including Beta Bugs, were introduced to the Royal Society of Edinburghrsquos Unlocking Ambition Enterprise Fellowship programme.:Mad cow disease confirmed on Scottish farmAmong them is a revolutionary robotic lawnmower business, which has introduced ground-breaking mapping technology to enable machines to work across large areas of land, such as golf courses and parks.Joan Kangro, the founder of Kingdom Technologies Ltd., says the robotic lawnmowers have been designed with multiple sensors and cameras to enable them to operate safely in public spaces.ldquoOther robot lawnmowers use reactive safety measures, sothey bump into an obstruction they will go in a new direction.

This is close to where the heart gives out. .But then a Loganair plane passes noisily overhead, and real le intrudes, as it must: on board are two policemen, come to investigate the disappearance of Ivan, a withdrawn local man who has done some work for Dr Alexander. Ivan is later found dead, from natural causes.Dr Alexander had given up his Glasgow practice for ious reasons and, together with his we Maggie, a former anaesthetist, their four boysand their gaggle of pets , had made the long journey to Eday, where he had been appointed as the local GP. The island lies off the Orkney mainland, watched over by Westray, Sanday, Stronsay and Rousay.He wasnrsquot bowled over by the GPrsquos house and surgery when he first encountered them, however. The house was largely dilapidated, with a grubby bathroom the surgery was equally desolate, with a torn examination couch and a computer and keyboard covered in dust.It says much for him that he didnrsquot have an immediate change of heart andto Glasgow and their ldquobeautul west end home. But remain he did.One of the very first patient files he opened was a poignant one: an elderly lady, Agnes ndash Nessie, who was born in , and who lived almost her entire le on Eday, moving only briefly to mainland Orkney, after the Great War. Her medical history and, indeed, her le history were contained in that file.Amidst descriptions of island le, andof the islanders themselves, a key moment in the book occurs when Maggie, newly pregnant, has to be rushed to hospital in Aberdeen after serious complications arise, forcing Dr Alexander to look after their four sons while continuing to see to his many patients.These and other events happened exactly  years ago. The good doctor retired in  and now, aged , lives on another island, Bute. But in this -page book, which details his first year as Edayrsquos GP, they are as fresh asthey happened yesterday.ldquoI suppose it did surprise me, that I could remember so many details, he says. ldquoWhen I started out on the book, the heart of the story was Maggie having to go away. Irsquod been having an email exchange with my agent Laura [Macdougall, of United Agents], who had been looking for somebody who had done the kind of job that I had done. She asked me, what could I write ldquoI thought the best place to start was the really emotional aspects, and then seeI can build from there. It was remarkable what I could remember once you put yourself back into the place.ldquoIt was quite an emotional experience, a powerful one, to write about Eday after a gap of  years, to unwrap things you hadnrsquot thought of.ldquoOne of the boys said it was fascinating to read about their le from somebody rsquos perspective. They think, lsquooh, thatrsquos how dad saw us at that timersquo, and it made me think about how I responded to them as kids.ldquoObviously, in the book there are regrets and there are achievements, nice things as well, but it was quite testing at times, just to write some of the simplest things.Dr Alexander and his family remained on Eday until . They went to Stromness, where he served as one of the GPs, and eventually, on Kirkwall, he became the medical director at Orkney Health Board after that, he was Associate Medical Director at NHS  before going full circle and working at his local GP practice on Bute.His book certainly has a strong sense of place. ldquoThatrsquos what struck me most particularly about the physical location, because you can just see so many things on it. One thing I didnrsquot mention in the book was the Stone of Setter, which is right in the middle of Eday and is one of the tallest standing stones in Orkney. These things are all over the place. You canrsquot escape the fact that there was a Neolithic presence. You canrsquot escape the geology, because it keeps erupting in front of you. It really is quite a remarkable place.ldquoIrsquove gone back regularly to Orkney, managing almost annually, but have only once been back to Eday since we left. When Maggie and I last went, we had a look-round and tried to find folks, and chat to them. That was probably the hardest part, not being able to find them, because obviously a lot of them have died, or moved off the island.ldquoWe subsequently tracked down a couple of people, though. Some of the kids are still there: we were able to meet the ones who had been at school with our kids, but most of the folk who created that environment, which almost had a s feel to it, most of them have moved on.Had Eday changed much from the time when he was the sole local GP  ldquoPhysically, it doesnrsquot look as though it has changed much, he says. ldquoMaybe therersquos a little less obvious crofting, with its stacks, its stacks of hay and barley and peat ... that seemed to have disappeared a bit, from what I could see.Can he envisage having been Edayrsquos GP for the last  years  ldquoThe challenge, he says, ldquowould have been keeping up to date. That would have been the real issue, Whereas now, [no GP] really stays in the one place exclusively, so they can get as wide a training as possible.For a first-time writer, he has done an excellent job with his account. In reference to that passage where he is enjoying nature just before he sees the Loganair plane coming in to land, he says: ldquoI wanted to try to capture the feel of the peace,you like, of the place, but also the speed which with reality can intrude.ldquoYou had to get used to that. If you couldnrsquot live with that, then you had to move on, you had to go back to at least a town environment, where somebody  could take over and be on call.ldquoI loved it, but I was brought up with it ndash we were used to being on our own we were used to seeing the road blocked with snow, and not fussing.Close to Where the Heart Gives Out: A Year in the Le of an Orkney Doctorhardback , Michael OrsquoMara Books."},{"url":null,"title":"kirsty-strickland-snp-must-stop-public-spats-ranks-focus-main-goal-independence","story":"The Conservative Party has been torn apart by Brexit.

It is characteristic of our politics that sides were picked long before any details of the case were aired in courtWhile the two former friends largely avoided the media frenzy that would have been provoked by a public war of words, their allies and supporters were far from quiet.The ision between the two big beasts of the SNP gave cover to those elected representatives who were already growing frustrated with the top brass.The timing of a second independence referendum and the strategy for securing one has been an issue that has caused unrest within the ranks. There are those who are anxious for another vote as soon as possible. They say the SNP leadership has been too meek in its approach and has failed to capitalise on the shambolic Brexit process.In the Halcyon Days before Twitter, party disagreements would be confined to smoke-filled meeting rooms or whispered briefings to hungry journalists. Now, as is the nature and curse of social media, we say exactly whatrsquos on our minds.These debates and disagreements between the politicians are being played out on Twitter and in the media. When we consider the speed with which the disunity spread it is dficult to see how some will manage to find their way back to a place of restraint.It is the proposed reform of the Gender Recognition Actthat has provoked some of the most open and often hostile warring among SNP politicians.

Letrsquos focus on getting independence. #priorities\"Politicians will rightly speak up about issues which they care about and those issues will not always align, even within members of the same party. At this moment the SNPrsquos overriding priority should not be a futile quest to achieve universal agreement, but to gently remind its representatives of the political crisis we face. Social media spats in this moment of all moments look indulgent and counterproductive.A recent Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times showed that in the event of a Boris Johnson premiership, support for independence could rise to  per cent.

A painting at the Scottish Football Museum depicts a munitionette from Beardmore munitions factoryOne week later a game was played in Glasgow which had to be abandoned after the crowd stormed the pitch and mishandled the players.Mr McBrearty said: ldquoThe male spectators didnrsquot like what they saw. The general male attitude was that women shouldnrsquot take part in football, itrsquos a manly game and in the newspaper reports thatrsquos what comes across.The breakout of the First World War brought opportunity to Scotlandrsquos female footballers who filled the jobs, and football boots, of men sent to the front.Mr McBrearty said: ldquoThe huge conscription of young men saw womenrsquos football teams formed through the factories and there was a real change in attitudes.These munitionettes didnrsquot face criticism from the male press because their charity games contributed to the war effort, but when the men came home they were expected toto more ladylike pursuits.Women continued to play, forming local teams and leagues but records are fragmentary.Karen Fisher said: \"Whats surprising is just how much football was being played that has been ignored ndash it wasnrsquot hidden. A way to resist something is to ignore it and this is what was happening here.\"Mr McBrearty said: ldquoWomen had to fight massively for recognition. Thatrsquos why itrsquos brilliant that the players now whorsquove achieved so much are very aware they are standing on the shoulders of giants."},{"url":null,"title":"french connection for cycling club","story":"Two cyclists will fly the flag for Inverurie at its Pyrenean twin town this month during the world#s most gruelling and famous bike race.Pete Lowson, founder and chair of the Inverurie Cycling Club “Team Ecosse Northboats” , and club member, Lucy Ritchie, will be inBagneres-de-Bigorre, as it celebrates the arrival of the th stage of the annual Tour de France cycle race on July .Pete is flying to France especially to share in the area’s biggest day of  but Lucy’s visit the day before will be all-too brief.Lucy will be almost half-way through taking part in one of the toughest cycle challenges on the planet, to raise awareness of gender equality in cycling.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmAn on-going dispute between Highlands and Islands Airports Ltdand air traffic controllerswill see Kirkwall airport closed to air traffic on Monday July .

She explained: “I have a number of constituents, particularly those in the islands, who are required to travel to the mainland for medical treatment which is not provided in their home area.#As well as having to cope with side-effects from treatments, such as chemotherapy and operations, many of these constituents may require support for anxiety, depression or to face possible diagnoses while visiting mainland clinics.“In addition there are a number of constituents with mobility issues, permanent and temporary, who would feel great relief at being able to travel with an escort that they trust, without having to bear the extra financial burden.“With many NHS boards now refusing or unable to financially support escort travel I feel strongly that it would provide an invaluable service to vulnerable passengersthey were able to bring escorts with them at a reduced cost.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table. The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our communities and the airlines operating from our airports. We would encourage Prospect to revisit the offer and bring this dispute to an end.”The new strike dates will see Inverness Airport closed to traffic on July , Kirkwall and Sumburgh airports closed on July  and Stornoway Airport, Benbecula Airport and Dundee Airport closed on July .Prospect has said the work to rule previously announced will also continue.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A week does not seem to pass without someone appealing for a gentler, kinder style of politics. Well,my own experience this week is anything to go by it will be a long time coming. Indeed it is probably a forlorn hope. I am just back from attending the first meeting of the ninth session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg. It was an eventful experience and one that, unlike my colleagues, I am able to contrast and compare against the eight years I served in the Scottish Parliament. While the parliaments are dferent in a iety of waysthere was enough in my first week to give me a taste of what to expect. Sadly I can testy the nature of political discourse has deteriorated signicantly. Thus far it is not the behaviour of the parliamentarians that is especially dferent, but the relationship between politicians and the public that has changed. Politicians the world over and from all political colours can be pompous, ignorant, isive and rude – and courteous, inspiring, witty and magnanimous – or a combination of both – but that has always been the case. What I found this week was that in my  years away from professional politics as an elected servant of the people, the mood of the public appears to have changed dramatically for the worse.• : Outrage after new MEP Anne Widdecombe compares Brexit to emancipation of slavesIn my past le as a Tory MSP, I witnessed all sorts of stunts by opponents and colleagues, and took part intentionally or inadvertently in a few myself, but I cannot recall anything other than a handful of letters of complaint, never mind abusive language, in that time. Now there is an instant reaction that, courtesy of the internet, reaches elected members in a wide iety of forms – from text messages, emails,tweets and presumably Facebook posts . Some of it is vile, and the quantity surprised even an old dog like me.One particular example was the opening of the European Parliament itself, where the -plus members were told to stand for its “national anthem” before proceedings officially began. The Brexit Party MEPs had been sitting down at that point but had agreed amongst ourselves thatasked to stand we would do so with our backs to the dais.For us it was a quiet and dignied way of showing our rejection of the idea of a European superstate with its own flag, embassies, diplomatic corps, army – and an anthem that had already been rejected by prime minister TonyBlair and in referendums on the proposed EU constitution by the French and Dutch.As a statement, it did not require brightly coloured T-shirts with offensive slogans rejecting the UK’s democratic choice, or placards for MEPs to hold up in chamber– or causing a commotion or storming out in protest. It was just a silent rejection of an example of empire-building that has caused Europeans of all nations, but especially the British, to say we’ve had enough. After this short moment we then turned, sat down and participated in the remaining proceedings.Within minutes the messages were pinging into our phones, the emails were arriving and the media, receiving and witnessing the same, only wanted to talk about that one “disrespectful” event. For all but a few exceptions the Liberal Democrats’ “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts were ignored unless we made a point of asking why. • : MPs step up plans to block no-deal Brexit amid leadership contestEmails calling me a iety of epithets that would peel the nish of my mother’s front door soon reached my inbox. A suspicious swarm of similarly worded emails then flew in – berating me in emotional terms that would make those of a gentler disposition wish to seek solitude in a dark room.Former BBC politics journalist Gavin Esler tweeted we “shamelessly copied” the Nazi Party in s Germany who turned their backs on a Jewish speaker in the Reichstag – insinuating we share some political DNA them. This was somewhat ironic given the anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy was one of Hitler’s favourites and played to him on his birthday. More importantly Esler’s reaction completely ignored the lineage that turning one’s back is a form of political protest and signalled the double standards of so many of those criticising it on this occasion.As City lawyer Alex Deane pointed out, British POWs turned their backs on Japan’s Emperor Akihito in  as he passed down the Mall with Her Majesty the Queen. In  and  members of the public – co-ordinated by campaign groups including Hope Not Hate and Prayers for Peace – turned their backs on English Democratic League rallies held in Bradford city centre. In  some members of the public turned their backs on the funeral cortege of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as it passed on its way to St Paul’s Cathedral. Likewise, later that same year hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs on a speech by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a funeral of two officers killed on duty. More recently women turned their backs on Canadian premier Justin Trudeau protesting against his “fake feminism” and the same protest has been used against President Trump. Were those people borrowing their form of protest from the Nazis, did those protests receive condemnation from our liberal intelligentsia or be ridiculed by BBC staff, past and present, as my colleagues and I were  As the week moved on so did the media attention – but not the faux-outrage of social media victims. Quite correctly the media wanted to know what we thought of the EU’s backroom dealing to agree the candidates for ious positions including the parliament’s own president, president of the European Commission, the president of the Council of Ministers and president of the European Central Bank. While we pointed to the democratic shortcomings of that process, that is just one symptom of the EUs centralised and secretive government, the communications parading the personal upset over our back-turning just kept coming – without any reference to the EU elite’s disrespect to their own people.A gentler, kinder style of politics  If it ever existed I don’t think it’s ing soon.

And the former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned he will use Northern Ireland legislation to be debated in the House of Commons today as his latest bid to give MPs the chance to block no-deal.Mr Johnson insisted yesterday he is not bluffing over his commitment to leave the EU on  October – with or without a deal.The Tory leadership frontrunner said the EU had to “look deep into our eyes” and realise that the UK was prepared to walk away.Asked in an interview with the Sunday his commitment to the  October deadline was a bluff, Mr Johnson said: “No ... honestly. Come on. We’ve got to show a bit more gumption about this.”His campaign received the support of Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who said Mr Johnson was “better placed” than Jeremy Hunt to “deliver what we need to do at this critical time”.Mr Javid, who is widely believed to have his sights set on becoming chancellor under the new prime minister, called for an emergency budget for a no-deal Brexit.“Trust in our democracy will be at stakewe don’t make October  a ‘deal or no deal’ deadline,” he said.“To prepare that, we are agreed on the need for ramped-up no-deal preparations, including  a budget.”Mr Hunt also insisted he was not bluffing about being willing to walk away without a deal, although he told the Sundayit was “not the most secure way of guaranteeing Brexit” because MPs would try to block it.Former Tory leadership hopeful Sam Gyimah said more than  of the party’s own MPs could vote against a no-deal Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, the former education minister said there are a “signicant number” of Tory MPs who are looking at legislative options to block a no-deal Brexit.He added: “I think it is about , -plus. But what they will be looking to do is stop a prime minister from proroguing Parliament in order to deliver no deal, and tocreate options for the new prime minister so that no deal is not the only option we face on October .”Mr Gyimah warned no-deal was “the most successful way to have a second Scottish independence referendum [and] break up the UK”.He said he was not prepared to vote for a motion of no-confidence in the government over Brexit, but Mr Grieve confirmed he would do so “with great reluctance”.Speaking on the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics programme, he said: “We are going to have in the course of the next hours an important bill on Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland and Brexit go very closely together.“The chances are thatBrexit goes through as No Deal it’s going to be the end of the Northern Ireland Union with the UK, with serious political consequences flowing from it.“So that’s a bill which is a perfectly legitimate place to start looking at how one might make sure how a Brexit deal is fully debated.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, the Justice Secretary, David Gauke, said he would resign rather than serve under a prime minister who took the UK out of the EU without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

A long ball played over the top saw Jones hold off the challenge of Richard Arthur, before coolly slotting past Wood.Shetland captain Richard Arthurwith the officials and opposition captain before the match.

However, they were unable to truly test Paul Pritchard in the home goal, either in the remaining half an hour of play of five minutes of injury time.Shetland will now battle for bronze on Friday afternoon when they meet Isle of Man in the third-fourth place play-off match.Manager Main said after the match: #I#m very, very disappointed in regards of the result, but obviously very proud of the display we put on here in front of , people.#We took ten minutes or so to get into the game, but from there and they#re on I think we were certainly competing and then in the second half I thought we owned it and chasing that second ball.#We pushed hard, created chances, their goalkeeper pulled off a couple of great saves and on another day we may have made a decision by the referees.#It will be a tough one to take that, but once again we can take plenty of positives from it. We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away.

Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle.

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself. I thought it was too late to start but the apprenticeship has opened new doors for me, and I really enjoy the work I do and am proud of the new skills I’ve developed,” he said.“This award is really just the icing on the cake for me and it means a lot to be recognised for my hard work.”The  Electrical Awards took place recently at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, in Belfast.

It also has a few surprising facts even long time locals may not have been aware of!For example, did you know that in  the original Gilford Castle, owned by Sir Richard Johnston, was attacked by a band of insurgents who styled themselves ‘Hearts of Oak’ During the battle the Rev Samuel Morell, a Presbyterian minister, who had joined the defence, was killed.Were you also aware that during the First World War both Dunbarton House and Bannvale House were transformed into branches of the Ulster Volunteer Force hospital in Belfast  Dunbarton House was utilised as a -bed convalescent home for officers whilst Bannvale House provided nursing care for overseas sick and wounded soldiers.The illustrated booklet includes a handy map for those interested in taking an historical stroll around the town.The evening promises once again to provide an ideal opportunity for friends, old and new, to get together over a cup of tea and reminisce about times gone by.Copies of ‘Gilford Heritage Trail’ will be available to pick up at the event, and following the launch, can be obtained in Gilford Community Centre, Banbridge Tourist Information Centre and other local venues.The Heritage Trail booklet was funded by the Department of Social Development ‘Areas at Risk’ programme, and supported by Banbridge District Council.‘Drive for Drew’: Orange lodges rev up for fundraising event Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new moderator for dromore presbytery","story":"The Rev David Bruce has been appointed as the new Moderator of Dromore Presbytery.

This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the miami dance hall days are back","story":"SHOPPERS and workers on Great Victoria Street did a double take this week as the writing team and cast from the Miami Showband Story struck up a few classic numbers outside the Grand Opera House.Martin Lynch and Marie Jones along with showband man George Jones and West Belfast Miami member Des Lee entertained city centre shoppers ahead of the show’s premiere on August .Penned by Marie Jones and Martin Lynch, the team that wrote the George Best musical Dancing Shoes, the Miami Showband Story will take audiences through the joyous dance hall days of the s through to darker times and the atrocity of the murder of Fran O’Toole, Brian McCoy and guitarist Tony Geraghty on July  .The production will entertain audiences on a ten-night run at the Grand Opera House before embarking on a four-week tour of Ireland concluding at Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre in September.For ticket information visit www.goh."},{"url":null,"title":"my successor as pm has to deliver a seamless irish border says theresa may","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again.

By , the local authority must recycle % of all its waste.Confirmation that the new centre is due to open in July came at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee when it was also revealed that new restrictions are to be introduced governing how much waste people can dump daily.Over recent years, modern civic amenity sites have been developed in Ballynahinch and in Castlewellan and councillors have been told that the new facility in Downpatrick will be one of the most up-to-date of its kind.Increasing numbers of people use the existing Cloonagh Road facility which council officials have been keen to replace for a number of years, but had dficulty securing an appropriate site.Last week, councillors agreed new rules and regulations governing how much waste can not only bd taken to civic amenity sites in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch, but how often.Council officials are keen to have the same rules applying across all amenity sites which is not currently the case, but this is set to change when the new facility at the Flying Horse Road opens shortly.One of the key changes will be the drive to reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste taken to the facilities which officials are confident will have a positive impact on budgets as less waste will need to be processed.A communications plan is also being devised ahead of the opening of the new Downpatrick facility and a period of grace will initially be in place until people become accustomed to the new rules governing their use.Commercial waste will be accepted at the new Flying Horse Road facility, but there will be no access for horse boxes and high sided trailers, with a restriction on the size of vehicles entering the facility.Ratepayers will not be permitted to take wheeled bins to the recycling centre with people also urged to sort their waste before arrival. In addition, new daily limits are to be imposed.They are no more than eight bags of non-recyclable and recyclable waste, five bulky items,  kilograms of rubble, one trailer of grass and two mattresses.

Commercial vehicle tyres will not be accepted with a  litre limit on old paint tins per visit.Restrictions also apply to the amount of plasterboard and doors with people permitted to dump old kitchens only once every six months. Bathroom waste is restricted to ceramics, taps and shower glass with tiles classed as rubble waste.Oil tanks and drums are not permitted at any of the districtrsquos household recycling centres, alongside fluorescent tubes and liquid waste.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran welcomed the opening of the new facility.ldquoThere has been a need for this new centre for some considerable time and hopefully this investment will ensure people do not have to queue up to use it, he said.ldquoA large facility with increased skip capacity is exactly what is needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Noel helps Saray join record books with Everest expedition  ","story":"DROMARA adventurer Noel Hanna has been stopped in his intrepid tracks mdash by an international incident between Iran and the US.He had planned to scale the highest volcano in Asia this month but the Iranian air strike against an US drone last month meant that diplomatic relations would be volatile in the coming weeks and months.The  year-old had planned to led a team of climbers up Mount Damavand in Iran, which stands at ,m.ldquoAfter the Iran drone strike and the US threatening to retaliate we were advised not even to think about it, said Noel.Noel spoke to the Recorder about his latest venture up Mount Everest when he led the first successful ascent of the worldrsquos highest mountain by a black woman.He and South African businesswoman Saray Khumalo made global headlines when they reached the top of the ,-metre high summit on May .It was Ms Khumalorsquos fourth attempt and Noelrsquos ninth successful ascent of Everest.Noel explained that he was asked to take Saray at the last moment when she became aware that another black African woman was also planning to climb Everest.ldquoSeveral months before the expedition started she came to me about doing Everest in .

from strong links with the wider community.ldquoIn addition, they have a shared education partnership with Saintfield High School allowing pupils to avail of the wide range of facilities on offer at a

composite classes allowed their children to develop skills well beyond that expected of their age and older children are afforded meaningful leadership opportunities.Mr Hanna said parents at the meeting were keen to point out the ldquosuperb provision of extra-curricular provision activities, including ious musical and sporting opportunities.Mr Hanna said the school would work closely with the Education Authority and CCMS to seek a solution which would ldquoallow the long tradition of Catholic provision to continue in the school.Fr McHugh praised the loyalty and support of the

The second thing has been watching people grow in their faith and use their gts for the Lord as well as seeing how amazing they become under God’s transformation”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Phyllis is keen to acknowledge the role that her husband, David has played in her le and work.She said: “He was already a member of the congregation although it took me a while to find him! I must say the best thing that ever happened in my le was marrying David. He has become a real partner not only as my husband but in the ministry as well and I really couldn’t have done this job without his support over the years.”Phyllis admitted that she will miss the ‘fantastic’ staff team at West Church.She said: “I will miss the day to day things of ministry, particularly visiting people at home and in hospital. Those relationships are very special and precious. People make le what it is so often through the relationships you build with them. It is a privilege to be part of people’s lives and to have them trust you enough to share their inner-most thoughts and confidences.“I would love to thank all of the congregation who have made me part of the family at West. They have given me such joy and a peace in my work every day as I spend time with them.”The retiring Deaconess had particularly warm words for Rev. Daniel Kane, who has led the Ministry Team at West Church for  years.She said: “Daniel has been the best boss any Deaconess could ever have. He is a great man of vision but more than anything he enables staff to grow in their faith and to use the God-given gts with which they have been supplied.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
