Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Doubts cast on August rate rise after inflation holds steadyWage growth (excluding bonuses) slowed to 2.7 per cent while the figure including bonuses remained stuck at 2.5 per cent in the three months to May, according to the latest figures by the Office of National Statistics.However, the economy is predicted to have grown by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, up from 0.2 per cent between January and March.History of the Bank of England base rate                                                    Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said: \u0027The Monetary Policy Committee held off raising rates in May because it wanted to see evidence that the weak patch in economic activity at the start of the year was just a blip.\u0027The official data and business surveys released since then suggests that growth did indeed recover in Q2. \u0027With little slack left in the labour market, robust growth is likely to lead to a further increase in wage inflation.\u0027Alongside the MPC\u0027s ambition to return interest rates to a level from which they can be cut to help in the next downturn, we think that provides reason enough for the MPC to raise interest rates in August.\u0027          Living costs are set to rise as a result of Brexit, say economists  But while there seems to be agreement over an improvement of the economy up to now and positive expectations about wages in the coming months, some economists were concerned about housing affordability and the rise in the cost of living.While six out of nine saw wages improve in the next half year, three saw housing affordability worsen.When asked what they thought Brexit would bring, higher trading and living costs were the most likely outcomes cited by five and four out of nine economists respectively.Three also expected Brexit to weigh on the pound, meaning weaker exchange rates for holidaymakers.James Smith at ING said: \u0027Overall, the recent dataflow has suggested the economy has regained some poise after a particularly weak first quarter. \u0027With wage growth still performing reasonably well, it looks like the Bank is gearing up for a rate rise in August.\u0027But what comes thereafter is less certain. The retail sector is still struggling, whilst noise surrounding Brexit is only likely to ramp up as we head into the autumn. \u0027That could make it trickier for the Bank of England to hike rates further before the UK leaves the EU.\u0027 At Thursday\u0027s meeting, the Bank is also likely to increase its inflation forecasts, with a weaker pound and higher oil and energy prices pushing up the outlook and further justifying the need for a rise. £150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/21/4EA1D39500000578-0-image-m-20_1532724788875.jpg","title":"Jabong sale 2018 need know Big Brand Sale","story":"What is Jabong?Jabong is a lifestyle and fashion e-commerce web portal based in India.Based in Bengaluru, India and founded in 2012 by Praveen Sinha, Manu Jain, Arun Chandra Mohan and Lakshmi Potluri, the portal sells a wide array of footwear, apparel, beauty products, fashion accessories, fragrances and other lifestyle and fashion products.The Internet portal has seen rapid growth in recent years and was acquired by e-commerce giant Flipkart in July 2016 through its Myntra unit. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/09/4E9CDBCD00000578-0-image-a-12_1532680043999.jpg","title":"Aer Lingus pilot gets heated exchange air traffic control","story":"    An Aer Lingus pilot got into a heated exchange with an air traffic controller after he was made to circle around New York\u0027s JFK airport for an hour on Sunday after takeoff The flight from HAIL!

Some sell for nearly £6,000 – more than the price of many pedigree dogs.But there is a dark truth behind the trade – one condemned by welfare organisations including the RSPCA and the Kennel Club.Many of the dogs, they say, are born on unscrupulous and unregulated puppy farms, and suffer devastating ill health because they are created by repeatedly getting runts to breed together, thereby obtaining ever smaller puppies.The sister of a young doctor and his lawyer girlfriend who...Don\u0027t be lazy, you\u0027re coming for a walk! Adorable video...Share this articleBoth organisations have expressed serious concern about the exploitative trend, issuing startling warnings about the dogs’ physical frailties, which include weak bones that break easily, dislocated knees, lung problems and eyeballs that are too large for their sockets.It is a reality that a horrified Elaine, 64, and David, 70, discovered only too late.The couple had deliberated for years about getting a puppy and Elaine had admired a so-called ‘teacup Yorkie’ owned by a family member. The retired shop supervisor was delighted to discover one of the dogs was available for £550 through an online breeder near their home in Blackpool.          Short life: Teacup Yorkie Daisy, who died six days after being boughtFirst impressions were highly favourable. Daisy was handed over by an immaculately dressed woman in a spotless bungalow in Stockport, which had a Mercedes parked on the drive. Daisy came with official-looking papers from the Kennel Club, along with details about her immunisations.But within six days Daisy being taken home, she suffered kidney and liver failure, and died. Gradually, the truth about Daisy’s short and tragic life became clear.The Oxleys discovered through the police that they had been conned. Daisy had been shipped, along with other tiny dogs, to the UK from an Irish puppy farm.The immaculate house Elaine visited was, in fact, rented as a front for unsuspecting buyers and the Kennel Club papers were fake.‘I was gobsmacked to be told all of this,’ Elaine, 64, says. ‘They seemed like such nice, dog-loving people. The house appeared to be a family home, very clean, the puppy was in a pen that had clean bedding down when we got there. The woman even gave us a blanket that she said would smell of Daisy’s mother to comfort her.‘They were such good con artists who didn’t care about anything apart from making money.’Although the trade is legal, few of those involved are willing to discuss their part in it.Caroline Kisko, secretary of The Kennel Club, said the dogs are created through a ‘sad and appalling’ practice of repeatedly breeding the runt of a litter with another runt to guarantee tiny pets.‘They just breed the tiniest with the tiniest and so the animals just keep on shrinking,’ she said.‘People who buy these animals are making a wealth of sadness for themselves and that dog. Traditional small dog breeds have come about over more than 100 years, with love and dedication. These teacup dogs are about making money and nothing else.‘Why do dogs need to be able to sit in a teacup? You have to ask why.’Lisa Richards, from the RSPCA, added: ‘Breeders should prioritise welfare over appearance. It is very concerning to see people breeding dogs to fit in with the latest trend or fad. Dogs are intelligent, sentient creatures and should not be treated as a fashion accessory.’Lovepup advertise micro-dogs and teacup puppies. They come with a 30-day health guarantee, but common ailments such as knee dislocations and heart murmurs are not covered.Rolly Teacup Puppies, a company based in the US which ships teacup puppies to Europe – but not directly to the UK – offers a year’s guarantee, but again excludes ‘common conditions’ such as a hole in the skull and dislocating kneecaps.           The wide-eyed dogs often struggleThe company has nearly half a million followers on Instagram. A spokesperson said standard dogs cost from £2,900 to £4,500, with ‘premium’ pups costing up to £5,800. The price does not include delivery from the United States or Korea, which involves a transatlantic flight and customs checks.The firm also claims British customers are visiting their shops near Atlanta in the USA and in Korea to pick the animals up in person.The sad result of breeding increasingly delicate pets is already becoming clear, according to the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.One teacup poodle, nine-month-old Charlie, was ordered online for a reported £6,500 from South Korea by a wealthy family in Jordan. The dog was flown to the family’s dog trainer in Britain but a week later began limping. An X-ray revealed she needed surgery costing £3,000, which led to her being abandoned.A spokesman for the charity said: ‘Our vets found that Charlie had a fracture on her heel, a large break in a femur and evidence of an older fracture to the same leg that was healed. It was decided that it would be best to amputate the leg. Since having the operation she has been so much happier and lively, and we’ve been able to rehome her. Whether the leg issues were due to an accident in the home of the dog trainer – he said another dog had sat on her – or she had been treated badly by her breeder, we’ll never know.’One North West-based breeder, who did not wish to be named, said they stopped selling teacup puppies years ago after one of their ‘morkies’ – a Maltese crossed with a Yorkshire Terrier – was accidentally crushed by its owner’s son.          Distress: Miniature pups found abandoned and unwell‘That was heartbreaking,’ the breeder said. ‘These dogs are so tiny, it’s like having a hamster. Owners use them as toys but they’re animals. That’s why we stopped breeding them.’Both Lovepup and Rolly Teacup Puppies said they only worked with reputable breeders and did not support or work with puppy farms.Preloved said ‘it meets and exceeds’ the minimum standards set by the UK’s Pet Advertising Advisory Group.A Rolly Teacup Puppies spokesperson said: ‘Our puppies live their life to the fullest. We only work with a selected number of breeders that are ethical and are against inbreeding and are not a part of the puppy mills scheme.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/23/11/4E60E67E00000578-0-image-a-8_1532341899355.jpg","title":"Round world yacht race won woman time","story":"    Australian Wendy Tuck has become the first woman skipper to win the clipper Round The World Race  Worldwide manhunt is launched for \u0027cowardly\u0027 speedboat...Share this article‘I am really happy, it still hasn’t sunk in just yet, it is pretty amazing.’Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, who was in Liverpool to watch the climax of the race, said: ‘What we have had is two phenomenal women in what has been, in the past, a male-dominated sport, who will hopefully, go on and inspire other women to get involved.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/23/4EA8C16B00000578-0-image-m-16_1532816444989.jpg","title":"Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton speaks marriage split coach Scott Gardner","story":"    Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton has opened up about depression and marriage split She has won two Olympic golds in cycling, competed on Strictly Come Dancing and ridden at the Cheltenham Festival, but nothing has been a bigger challenge for Victoria Pendleton than battling depression.In an exclusive interview with Mail on Sunday Sports Editor Alison Kervin today, Pendleton, 37, gives a harrowing insight into her mental illness ordeal, which was sparked by a failed bid to climb Everest.She joined TV presenter Ben Fogle for an attempt on the summit to help raise funds for the Red Cross in May. Despite a \u0027magical\u0027 start, her body gave out at just over 6,500m (21,300ft) and doctors ordered her to return to sea level and recover in hospital for days on end, which is when the depression hit.\u0027It was horrible,\u0027 she recalled. \u0027The worst feeling.

And his youngest son, Matthew, 23, is also a part-time carer for his two brothers.The experience of adopting, the Pattersons say, has enriched their lives. But, they admit, it hasn’t always been easy. While Pam and Gerald’s friends are playing golf and heading off on luxury holidays in their retirement, the couple still need to organise a babysitter when they want to go out.More cruelly, the family have had to face insulting comments from passers-by, from doctors and even from their own relatives, one of whom asked why they were ruining their lives and the lives of their biological children.\u0027We must right a historic wrong\u0027: Women forced to give up...Share this articleTheir answer is simple, as they make clear today in an uplifting interview with The Mail on Sunday: they wished to care for children who might otherwise have languished in the care system.One of the most common genetic abnormalities, Down’s is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome, most commonly a chance occurrence at the time of conception. As well as the familiar facial features, those with Down’s syndrome – one child in 1,000 born in the UK has the condition – often have varying degrees of physical and mental disabilities.With the help of modern medicine, they can live to the age of 50 to 60, often meaning that they need a lifetime of care.Yet Pam and Gerald’s family insist they can neither understand the fuss people make about the condition, nor the praise people heap on them for doing what they describe as ‘no big deal’.Pam and Gerald already had two biological children, Emma, then six, and Chris, then two, when in 1985 they adopted James, their first Down’s child. He was just seven months old.They were fully aware of the task ahead of them. Pam and Gerald had spent much of the 1970s volunteering at the Gateway Club in Birmingham, which caters for children with special needs. Even so, the decision to adopt a disabled child left some friends and family reeling.‘One family member asked why we were ruining our lives,’ Pam, 60, reflects. ‘They felt we’d ruined our biological children’s lives, too. Some of our friends, whose lives had never been touched by special needs, couldn’t understand why we’d done it either. But we chose to adopt knowing that what we were taking on we were taking on for ever – and my older two had no problem.’Pam has long held a special affection for Down’s children. ‘At school I helped at a special school instead of doing sport, which I hated,’ she smiles. ‘It’s so rewarding. You get what you put in. They achieve because you put in the effort.’Today, James has very little speech but, according to his mother, has a sunny disposition and lives in the moment. ‘We could all learn a lot from him,’ she reflects, no doubt referring to the many critics she has faced down over the years. Pam recalls the time a GP raised needless concerns about her daughter Alice, whom she adopted at 12 weeks old in 1989. ‘I’d taken her to the doctor while we were on holiday in Cornwall,’ says Pam. ‘He asked if we knew she had Down’s and then said, “Do you realise what you’ve taken on?” He was really rude.‘I told him I’d come for an ear infection, not a moral discussion. They’re my children and you’d fight to the death for them.’Today, Alice is a gold medal-winning gymnast representing Great Britain all over Europe with the British disabled display team.Molly, whom she adopted at the age of three in 1996, was a bigger challenge. Visually impaired, she had never been to playgroup and she wasn’t walking. ‘She screamed and pulled hair. Yet today she has the most fantastic body language.’Then, In 2012, the couple agreed to take Riley. While her own children were always supportive of their adopted siblings, they were initially reticent about the three-year-old who was oxygen-dependent, had heart problems and was on a lot of drugs. Pam says: ‘The agency had been looking for a family who could take on a child with Down’s syndrome but who could also deal with the fact he might not make it. We were older but we thought it wouldn’t matter. We were at home anyway so we might as well be at home with one more.’Today, Riley’s progress is nothing short of miraculous. His heart has been repaired and he’s expected to live well past his teens.‘There aren’t many people who would adopt a child with special needs but it’s so rewarding,’ says Pam’s niece, Jenny Bull, a paediatric nurse. ‘In fact, I’d rather have a child with Down’s. I’ve grown up with them and never knew any different. Down’s is my normal.’She says her adopted daughter Isabel needed nothing more than patience. ‘She didn’t sit up until she was 11 months old and didn’t walk until she was two-and-a-half years old,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t an issue. I knew she would get there.’When the little girl was three, Jenny adopted identical twin boys, Tomas and George. ‘They aren’t verbal but they’re two little monkeys,’ she says. ‘I do get more stares when I’m out with all three of them, but I just ignore that.’If the joy has been considerable, so has the sacrifice. Says Pam: ‘We knew we wouldn’t have a retirement like our friends are having. They go off on holiday, they sit and read the papers. They play golf. We have to arrange a babysitter for nights out. That’s how we roll it’s our lives. I don’t understand how people find it odd. But it’s not odd to us.’Indeed, simply finding enough money for their brood has been hard and she says that the children must rely on disability living benefits.In addition, Pam sometimes worries about what will happen to her children when, eventually, she and Gerald die. Some adults with Down’s syndrome can live alone but Pam hopes her adopted children will continue to live in their family home with carers. She neither expects nor wants her biological children to move in and care for them. ‘They have partners and children of their own. I wouldn’t want them to take them on. It was our choice.’But until then she and Gerald will continue to care for their adopted children and who knows, maybe even adopt another?‘I’d adopt another one tomorrow but, now I’m older, I can’t give them the commitment they need,’ she says. ‘Look, to us, it’s not out of the ordinary. We’re not saints, we’re not perfect. It’s just our lives and what we have chosen to do and we wouldn’t change it for the world.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/12/4EA37BD400000578-0-image-a-6_1532777311231.jpg","title":"RAF aircrafts refuel mid air instead","story":"    A £10.5 billion fleet of military jets bought to refuel RAF aircraft in mid-air cannot fill up planes used to support British Special Forces operations.

If a moustache is worn, the upper lip is to be unshaved and the moustache is not to extend below the edge of the mouth.\u0027Beards may be permitted on religious grounds or when specially authorised on medical grounds.\u0027For occupational or operational reasons, where a hazard clearly exists, personnel with beards may be ordered to modify facial hair to enable the correct wearing of a respirator or breathing apparatus.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/22/4E9A8B9A00000578-0-image-m-62_1532726569582.jpg","title":"Workers dunk ginger biscuits tea disapproved colleagues","story":"    Dipping your digestive in a cup of tea is a definite a no-no, according to a study of office habitsLegacy of the Mail\u0027s war on plastic: Figures show 5p charge...Riding an electric bicycle is just as healthy as pedalling a...Share this articleMore than a quarter of workers say biscuits are their favourite office snack, the report by McVitie\u0027s reveals – but practice at home may be deeply annoying in the workplace. While 71 per cent of us confess to being \u0027dunkers\u0027, one in five admit they\u0027d disapprove of a colleague who dunked a biscuit in a meeting. Leaving crumbs on someone\u0027s desk was found to be the biggest faux-pas (38 per cent).

It was as if it had just landed,\u0027 he recalled.\u0027The pilot had made a skilled water landing after they lost power to the last engine while trying to land at Vis airfield, a place where many crippled bombers headed for after being shot up over Europe during the war.           Accompanying articles mentioned that the body of the co-pilot, US Army Air Force Second Lieutenant Ernest Vienneau, was still inside the wreckage.

A massive sell-off would be expected to create a spike in yields, raising the cost of borrowing for the US government. The spike above in mid-May represents a seven-year high, but soon stabilizedThe third possibility is that Russia predicted a move in the market, and hoped to take advantage. If so, such a market move has yet to materialize.If the Treasuries dump was an attempt to drive up the cost of US borrowing, it failed. The 10-year yield rose only 11 basis points from the end of March to the end of May.\u0027The market now has the answer to what would happen to Treasuries if a major holder decided to sell everything,\u0027 Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets jokingly told Chappatta.

Some sell for nearly £6,000 – more than the price of many pedigree dogs.But there is a dark truth behind the trade – one condemned by welfare organisations including the RSPCA and the Kennel Club.Many of the dogs, they say, are born on unscrupulous and unregulated puppy farms, and suffer devastating ill health because they are created by repeatedly getting runts to breed together, thereby obtaining ever smaller puppies.The sister of a young doctor and his lawyer girlfriend who...Don\u0027t be lazy, you\u0027re coming for a walk! Adorable video...Share this articleBoth organisations have expressed serious concern about the exploitative trend, issuing startling warnings about the dogs’ physical frailties, which include weak bones that break easily, dislocated knees, lung problems and eyeballs that are too large for their sockets.It is a reality that a horrified Elaine, 64, and David, 70, discovered only too late.The couple had deliberated for years about getting a puppy and Elaine had admired a so-called ‘teacup Yorkie’ owned by a family member. The retired shop supervisor was delighted to discover one of the dogs was available for £550 through an online breeder near their home in Blackpool.          Short life: Teacup Yorkie Daisy, who died six days after being boughtFirst impressions were highly favourable. Daisy was handed over by an immaculately dressed woman in a spotless bungalow in Stockport, which had a Mercedes parked on the drive. Daisy came with official-looking papers from the Kennel Club, along with details about her immunisations.But within six days Daisy being taken home, she suffered kidney and liver failure, and died. Gradually, the truth about Daisy’s short and tragic life became clear.The Oxleys discovered through the police that they had been conned. Daisy had been shipped, along with other tiny dogs, to the UK from an Irish puppy farm.The immaculate house Elaine visited was, in fact, rented as a front for unsuspecting buyers and the Kennel Club papers were fake.‘I was gobsmacked to be told all of this,’ Elaine, 64, says. ‘They seemed like such nice, dog-loving people. The house appeared to be a family home, very clean, the puppy was in a pen that had clean bedding down when we got there. The woman even gave us a blanket that she said would smell of Daisy’s mother to comfort her.‘They were such good con artists who didn’t care about anything apart from making money.’Although the trade is legal, few of those involved are willing to discuss their part in it.Caroline Kisko, secretary of The Kennel Club, said the dogs are created through a ‘sad and appalling’ practice of repeatedly breeding the runt of a litter with another runt to guarantee tiny pets.‘They just breed the tiniest with the tiniest and so the animals just keep on shrinking,’ she said.‘People who buy these animals are making a wealth of sadness for themselves and that dog. Traditional small dog breeds have come about over more than 100 years, with love and dedication. These teacup dogs are about making money and nothing else.‘Why do dogs need to be able to sit in a teacup? You have to ask why.’Lisa Richards, from the RSPCA, added: ‘Breeders should prioritise welfare over appearance. It is very concerning to see people breeding dogs to fit in with the latest trend or fad. Dogs are intelligent, sentient creatures and should not be treated as a fashion accessory.’Lovepup advertise micro-dogs and teacup puppies. They come with a 30-day health guarantee, but common ailments such as knee dislocations and heart murmurs are not covered.Rolly Teacup Puppies, a company based in the US which ships teacup puppies to Europe – but not directly to the UK – offers a year’s guarantee, but again excludes ‘common conditions’ such as a hole in the skull and dislocating kneecaps.           The wide-eyed dogs often struggleThe company has nearly half a million followers on Instagram. A spokesperson said standard dogs cost from £2,900 to £4,500, with ‘premium’ pups costing up to £5,800. The price does not include delivery from the United States or Korea, which involves a transatlantic flight and customs checks.The firm also claims British customers are visiting their shops near Atlanta in the USA and in Korea to pick the animals up in person.The sad result of breeding increasingly delicate pets is already becoming clear, according to the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.One teacup poodle, nine-month-old Charlie, was ordered online for a reported £6,500 from South Korea by a wealthy family in Jordan. The dog was flown to the family’s dog trainer in Britain but a week later began limping. An X-ray revealed she needed surgery costing £3,000, which led to her being abandoned.A spokesman for the charity said: ‘Our vets found that Charlie had a fracture on her heel, a large break in a femur and evidence of an older fracture to the same leg that was healed. It was decided that it would be best to amputate the leg. Since having the operation she has been so much happier and lively, and we’ve been able to rehome her. Whether the leg issues were due to an accident in the home of the dog trainer – he said another dog had sat on her – or she had been treated badly by her breeder, we’ll never know.’One North West-based breeder, who did not wish to be named, said they stopped selling teacup puppies years ago after one of their ‘morkies’ – a Maltese crossed with a Yorkshire Terrier – was accidentally crushed by its owner’s son.          Distress: Miniature pups found abandoned and unwell‘That was heartbreaking,’ the breeder said. ‘These dogs are so tiny, it’s like having a hamster. Owners use them as toys but they’re animals. That’s why we stopped breeding them.’Both Lovepup and Rolly Teacup Puppies said they only worked with reputable breeders and did not support or work with puppy farms.Preloved said ‘it meets and exceeds’ the minimum standards set by the UK’s Pet Advertising Advisory Group.A Rolly Teacup Puppies spokesperson said: ‘Our puppies live their life to the fullest. We only work with a selected number of breeders that are ethical and are against inbreeding and are not a part of the puppy mills scheme.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/16/4E58DD7900000578-0-image-m-10_1531843148774.jpg","title":"Beaming pride devotion meet family whove adopted NINE children Downs syndrome","story":"Left to right: George Bull, 3 , James Patterson, 32, Jenny Bull, 33, Gerald Patterson, 62, Isabel Bull, 6, Alice Patterson, 28, Pam Patterson, 60, David Bull, 35, Riley Patterson, 10, Molly Patterson, 26, Leigh Bull, 61, Matthew Bull, 23, Timothy Bull 28, Roger Bull, 65, Tomas Bull, 3Added to the remarkable group are David, 35, and Timothy, 28, who were adopted by Pam’s brother Roger Bull and his wife Leigh, who also foster four-year-old Marie.Meanwhile, Roger’s daughter, Jenny, 33, adopted six-year-old Isabel and more recently three-year-olds twins, George and Tomas. And his youngest son, Matthew, 23, is also a part-time carer for his two brothers.The experience of adopting, the Pattersons say, has enriched their lives. But, they admit, it hasn’t always been easy. While Pam and Gerald’s friends are playing golf and heading off on luxury holidays in their retirement, the couple still need to organise a babysitter when they want to go out.More cruelly, the family have had to face insulting comments from passers-by, from doctors and even from their own relatives, one of whom asked why they were ruining their lives and the lives of their biological children.\u0027We must right a historic wrong\u0027: Women forced to give up...Share this articleTheir answer is simple, as they make clear today in an uplifting interview with The Mail on Sunday: they wished to care for children who might otherwise have languished in the care system.One of the most common genetic abnormalities, Down’s is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome, most commonly a chance occurrence at the time of conception. As well as the familiar facial features, those with Down’s syndrome – one child in 1,000 born in the UK has the condition – often have varying degrees of physical and mental disabilities.With the help of modern medicine, they can live to the age of 50 to 60, often meaning that they need a lifetime of care.Yet Pam and Gerald’s family insist they can neither understand the fuss people make about the condition, nor the praise people heap on them for doing what they describe as ‘no big deal’.Pam and Gerald already had two biological children, Emma, then six, and Chris, then two, when in 1985 they adopted James, their first Down’s child. He was just seven months old.They were fully aware of the task ahead of them. Pam and Gerald had spent much of the 1970s volunteering at the Gateway Club in Birmingham, which caters for children with special needs. Even so, the decision to adopt a disabled child left some friends and family reeling.‘One family member asked why we were ruining our lives,’ Pam, 60, reflects. ‘They felt we’d ruined our biological children’s lives, too. Some of our friends, whose lives had never been touched by special needs, couldn’t understand why we’d done it either. But we chose to adopt knowing that what we were taking on we were taking on for ever – and my older two had no problem.’Pam has long held a special affection for Down’s children. ‘At school I helped at a special school instead of doing sport, which I hated,’ she smiles. ‘It’s so rewarding. You get what you put in. They achieve because you put in the effort.’Today, James has very little speech but, according to his mother, has a sunny disposition and lives in the moment. ‘We could all learn a lot from him,’ she reflects, no doubt referring to the many critics she has faced down over the years. Pam recalls the time a GP raised needless concerns about her daughter Alice, whom she adopted at 12 weeks old in 1989. ‘I’d taken her to the doctor while we were on holiday in Cornwall,’ says Pam. ‘He asked if we knew she had Down’s and then said, “Do you realise what you’ve taken on?” He was really rude.‘I told him I’d come for an ear infection, not a moral discussion. They’re my children and you’d fight to the death for them.’Today, Alice is a gold medal-winning gymnast representing Great Britain all over Europe with the British disabled display team.Molly, whom she adopted at the age of three in 1996, was a bigger challenge. Visually impaired, she had never been to playgroup and she wasn’t walking. ‘She screamed and pulled hair. Yet today she has the most fantastic body language.’Then, In 2012, the couple agreed to take Riley. While her own children were always supportive of their adopted siblings, they were initially reticent about the three-year-old who was oxygen-dependent, had heart problems and was on a lot of drugs. Pam says: ‘The agency had been looking for a family who could take on a child with Down’s syndrome but who could also deal with the fact he might not make it. We were older but we thought it wouldn’t matter. We were at home anyway so we might as well be at home with one more.’Today, Riley’s progress is nothing short of miraculous. His heart has been repaired and he’s expected to live well past his teens.‘There aren’t many people who would adopt a child with special needs but it’s so rewarding,’ says Pam’s niece, Jenny Bull, a paediatric nurse. ‘In fact, I’d rather have a child with Down’s. I’ve grown up with them and never knew any different. Down’s is my normal.’She says her adopted daughter Isabel needed nothing more than patience. ‘She didn’t sit up until she was 11 months old and didn’t walk until she was two-and-a-half years old,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t an issue. I knew she would get there.’When the little girl was three, Jenny adopted identical twin boys, Tomas and George. ‘They aren’t verbal but they’re two little monkeys,’ she says. ‘I do get more stares when I’m out with all three of them, but I just ignore that.’If the joy has been considerable, so has the sacrifice. Says Pam: ‘We knew we wouldn’t have a retirement like our friends are having. They go off on holiday, they sit and read the papers. They play golf. We have to arrange a babysitter for nights out. That’s how we roll it’s our lives. I don’t understand how people find it odd. But it’s not odd to us.’Indeed, simply finding enough money for their brood has been hard and she says that the children must rely on disability living benefits.In addition, Pam sometimes worries about what will happen to her children when, eventually, she and Gerald die. Some adults with Down’s syndrome can live alone but Pam hopes her adopted children will continue to live in their family home with carers. She neither expects nor wants her biological children to move in and care for them. ‘They have partners and children of their own. I wouldn’t want them to take them on. It was our choice.’But until then she and Gerald will continue to care for their adopted children and who knows, maybe even adopt another?‘I’d adopt another one tomorrow but, now I’m older, I can’t give them the commitment they need,’ she says. ‘Look, to us, it’s not out of the ordinary. We’re not saints, we’re not perfect. It’s just our lives and what we have chosen to do and we wouldn’t change it for the world.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/16/4E98375D00000578-0-image-m-47_1532706242680.jpg","title":"The photo smiling Ellie Soutter taken cousins wedding","story":"    Ellie Soutter, a rising star of snowboarding, was found dead in the French resort of Les Gets last week.

They picked up her scent at the house and police then began searching in nearby woodland.Jeremy said: \u0027It was 11.15pm when they found her. There was no note, nothing. She was somewhere you can hardly access. She must have just kept walking and walking. Police struggled to get there.\u0027He said Tony will scatter Ellie\u0027s ashes on one of her favourite mountains in Les Gets.Ellie moved to Les Gets in 2009. She attended the local primary school, followed by an international school and then the local college.By 2015, her sporting commitments meant she was home schooled for the final two years of her education.Jeremy said: \u0027She wasn\u0027t just sporty. She was very bright too. She got top academic results which is really something considering all the sport she was doing. \u0027But Tony never pressured her. This was not some parent\u0027s dream. This was coming from her. She loved the sport and Tony supported her in any way he could. Financially, emotionally.\u0027The outpouring of affection and grief has been overwhelming. There\u0027s no way she understood what she meant to so many people.\u0027There are so many ifs and buts. Too many to contemplate. Until Wednesday we were just a family like any other other, believing something like this happens to other people not us.\u0027           On the podium: Ellie won medals at the Freeride Junior Tour where she finished in third place.

That was her happy place. I don\u0027t think this has to do with her snowboarding.\u0027She would call me even after we were no longer together and ask for help in the form of talking about things. I wouldn\u0027t use the word depressed. She was just sad sometimes. And she wanted to speak to someone who knew her. So we\u0027d meet for a coffee and talk. But this time she didn\u0027t call me. She didn\u0027t call anyone.\u0027She had had an unstable period but she\u0027d got through that. So I was so shocked when I heard what happened.\u0027Tony had called me at about 4pm asking me if there was anywhere she might go.\u0027After a few hours we were getting concerned. I got a call at 1am from a friend to tell me that the police had found her.\u0027I\u0027m close to her dad still. We are good friends. He was an incredible father. Devoted everything to her. He\u0027s an extraordinary man.\u0027When Ellie and I were dating we always said we\u0027d look out for each other\u0027s families if anything happened to either of us. I\u0027ll do that.\u0027Oscar described Ellie as \u0027very determined\u0027.He said: \u0027She was a really fantastic person. She was very determined in everything she did.\u0027They began dating in May 2015. In September they visited the UK and then Paris together.They also travelled to New Zealand together competing. Their relationship lasted for almost two years.                                                    School friends expressed their shock at her death.One 18-year-old girl wept as she said: \u0027No one can understand why she would do this. She seemed so happy. It\u0027s such a big shock. She had plenty of friends, she was going really far with her sport, she had so much.\u0027Olly Edwards, a family friend, said: \u0027My wife Jo and I have know Ellie since she was little. She was a cheeky, happy and smiley child with a lot of heart.\u0027She achieved a lot in her short life and her father is very proud of her. Tony is one of the very best fathers on this planet and he has been overwhelmed by all the love and support. She will be sorely missed.\u0027Speaking from the hotel he owns in Les Gets, Peter Rhodes, a close friend of Ellie\u0027s father\u0027s, said: \u0027I\u0027ve know on Ellie since she moved here eight years ago. She was so full of life. Ellie was a great kid. We just don\u0027t know why it happened.\u0027She was completely integrated into life here. She was bilingual and had as many French friends as British ones.\u0027Tony\u0027s life revolved around her.

A massive sell-off would be expected to create a spike in yields, raising the cost of borrowing for the US government. The spike above in mid-May represents a seven-year high, but soon stabilizedThe third possibility is that Russia predicted a move in the market, and hoped to take advantage. If so, such a market move has yet to materialize.If the Treasuries dump was an attempt to drive up the cost of US borrowing, it failed. The 10-year yield rose only 11 basis points from the end of March to the end of May.\u0027The market now has the answer to what would happen to Treasuries if a major holder decided to sell everything,\u0027 Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets jokingly told Chappatta.

My internal disorientation is mirrored by the world’s perhaps it is even caused by it. We are surrounded by confusion. I am afraid of what will happen. Round every corner, down every false trail, there are monstrous dangers that threaten to consume us. Will we ever find a clear path to lead us through?I have never been able to find my way. If I once possessed a sense of direction, I have long surrendered it to the reassuring blue thread of the map on my smartphone. But I never had one, really. Turn me loose in a city without a map and panic rises, as if I were a child who had lost the grip of a parent’s hand in a crowd.Conversely, I cannot even lose myself effectively. One night in Rome, I set myself the task of trying to do it. I was living, for the month of February 2016, in a building in the Borghese gardens, and one evening, leaving behind my partner and his son, who were engaged in some task in which I played no role, I set forth with the express purpose of aimlessness. I would simply walk, I thought, taking random turnings when it felt right to do so. But all I did was wind round and around, covering no real ground, re-emerging frustratingly again and again on the straight and dreary spine of the Corso. Nothing was discovered. There were no revelations, only weariness. Having no destination in mind – no church, no gallery, no park or vista or bar, as we usually had on our wintry, twilit walks that month – I felt flat and dismal.Eventually I turned a corner and came into a square in which stood a church, San Lorenzo in Lucina. Stepping inside, I came across the pale, restrained tomb of the painter Nicolas Poussin. On it was carved a likeness of his own painting, which hangs in the Louvre, of shepherds in some pastoral idyll stumbling on a sarcophagus on which is inscribed “Et in Arcadia ego”, meaning “I, too, was in Arcadia”. The phrase is ambiguous. Who is this “I”? The dead man, who once enjoyed all the pleasures of Arcadia? Or death itself, which haunts even the most beautiful landscapes? It felt, at least, that I had found an end to the walk.On the path of my life, in the middle of my life, I know little about where I have been, and where I might go. The path that lies ahead of me is a riddle. But the path that lies behind is indistinct, too: its myriad and confusing turns already half forgotten, the significance of the landmarks encountered along the way misunderstood, misinterpreted.Once upon a time, when I was a child, my parents took me to Crete. We went to Knossos, whose remains, discovered a little over a century ago, are not classical, but of the bronze age, traces of a civilisation a thousand years older than the busily literate Athens. The little writing the inhabitants left behind them, a script we know as Linear B, was deciphered in the early 1950s. It was found to consist mostly of lists of goods: the dull unromantic stuff of bureaucracy. It did not unlock the hearts and imaginations of the people who had lived surrounded by an exuberant luxury of faience and glass and crystal, dashingly elegant frescoes and a swirling vigour of painted pottery.I can recall moments of this trip with sharp clarity. I remember my father observing that the buildings had been heavily reconstructed, so that, he implied, our experience was a little compromised, less authentic than it might have been. I remember a huddle of giant pithoi, terracotta storage jars so tall that they loomed over me. I remember walking down a stairway into the heart of the building. Here was a bath to be filled with pure water where a queen might bathe, or so we were told. There was a stone throne with a narrow curving back that looked like something out of Narnia, standing in a room painted with gryphons and waving, coiling flower stems. Another room was painted with dolphins flipping through turquoise waters.I can remember the guide saying that the myth of the labyrinth started here: the story that Minos, king of Crete, ordered the inventor Daedalus to build a labyrinth to house the half-bull, half-man Minotaur. That the Athenians were forced to pay the Cretans a regular tribute of seven boys and seven girls, who would be left in the labyrinth to be consumed by the monster. That one year, Theseus, the son of the king of Athens, came to Crete as part of this tribute. That with the help of King Minos’s daughter Ariadne, he killed the creature and found his way out of the perplexing building. That Theseus and Ariadne escaped over the sea, but instead of marrying her as he had promised, the Athenian prince left her behind as she slept on the island of Naxos. That when Theseus sailed within sight of Athens, he forgot to lower the ochre sail and hoist the white fabric that would signal to his father that he was alive, so the old king, in his grief, threw himself off the rocks and died. And that the god Bacchus came to Ariadne on Naxos, and fell in love with her.The guide said that out there on the broad terrace, Minos, or some Cretan king a shade more real, may have sat and watched acrobats twist and leap in the air, cascading over the horned heads of bulls, just like in the fresco of bull leapers here on the palace wall. (Though it turned out the fresco was a reproduction the original was in the museum in the city.) Perhaps the bull acrobatics – if the frescoes showed us what really happened at Knossos – were the reason that stories began about the biformed Minotaur.The guide admitted that there was nothing you could exactly call a labyrinth at Knossos, but that the intricacy and complexity of the building, with its winding corridors and bewildering floor plan, may have been the basis of the legend, as memory dimmed into myth in the centuries after the palace was wiped out by earthquake, fire and war. I remember how much I wanted these narrow rooms and passages to be labyrinthine, to trap and contain me, to be magical, to be a code, to be something that could be unlocked. I wanted to lose myself in them. This was where it began, my longing for the labyrinth. Even here it seemed just out of reach: a rumour, a trace, a clue.We also went to the museum at Heraklion, the city on whose outskirts Knossos lies. I remember the guide who showed us around. She must have been about the age I am now, neatly dressed in a formal brown suit, while we sweated in short sleeves and sandals. At the end of the tour she turned to me and gave me a little envelope containing three postcards – my reward for being an attentive and interested child. One was of the bull leapers fresco. The second was of another fresco, this time of three beautiful women in blue dresses, gesturing to each other with infinite delicacy. The last was of an intricately worked golden pendant, of two bees curving around a drop of honey.I never quite forgot about the guide and her gift to me. The postcards were, together, a talisman, a key to a certain place that became harder to visit, in my imagination, as I became older. One day, some years after I left university, I found the postcards again, quite by accident, hidden away in my bureau, in an old cedarwood box: the acrobats, the beautiful women, the bee pendant. In an envelope, too, a piece of paper bearing the name and address, in old, faded ink, of Sofia Grammatiki, who had guided us around the museum two decades before.On a whim, I decided to send her a letter. I didn’t really expect a reply. Some months later, though, I got one. It turned out that her son was living in her old flat in the city. She had moved away into the island, to the Amari valley. It pleased her that her tour, and her small gift, had meant something and that I had gone on to study classics. She herself, she wrote, had studied classical philology in Athens many years ago, before returning to Crete and becoming a high school teacher of Latin and ancient Greek, often earning a little extra in the holidays touring visitors around.Over the course of the long correspondence that followed, at first by letter and then by email, it turned out that we shared an obsession with labyrinths. Of course she knew all about the Knossian labyrinth of myth, but she was also knowledgeable about the labyrinths and mazes of later literature and landscapes, for she had walked the maze at Hampton Court and the great 13th-century labyrinth picked out in the stone floor of Chartres Cathedral. She used to speculate on why they appealed to her so. “The great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges has compared the labyrinth to the boundless ocean, the desert wastes and the disorienting wilds of the forest,” she wrote. “These are, yes, confounding and frightening places. And yet the labyrinth is never so terrifying. A maze or a labyrinth has always been designed by a person. This means that another person has always the possibility of breaking its code. To be inside a maze or a labyrinth is to be bewildered, confused or afraid. But it is, nonetheless, also to be inside a structure. It is to be lost, but only up to a point. It is also to be held within a design and a pattern.” In one email I asked Mrs Grammatiki whether she had ever had the kind of recurring dreams that I’d had – in which a door would spontaneously appear in an apparently familiar building, usually my flat in London, or my childhood home. In these dreams, which I still have, I push open the door and wander through room after room of ancient stacked-up furniture and cobwebbed bric-a-brac, exploring spaces that cannot possibly exist within the flat’s footprint, and resemble the warehouse of some careless and untidy seller (or collector) of antiquities. Sometimes I dream of whole wings and enfilades of rooms, each leading to the next or of a single twining, corkscrewing passage that winds round into a centre. In these dreams, I feel a mixture of pleasant surprise (so much space I hadn’t known about!) and dread. I was, therefore, less confident than her about the essentially benign nature of labyrinths. I think they have the capacity to terrify. The Minotaur lives there, after all.After this, she wrote back: “You are right to make this connection between the labyrinth and the world of dreams. For me it is very strong. Borges wrote that a library is a labyrinth. This is also true – the rows of bookshelves running on for miles, with paths and passageways between them, the classification of the texts working as a kind of cipher that the reader must decode in order to find what she wants. That is only the superficial idea, however. Borges meant that literature is itself a labyrinth, and that every library contains the possibility of infinite places and infinite existences. Open a book in a library and you can disappear into a world, its cities, and its landscapes. All books, in turn, are labyrinths that express the winding shapes of their writers’ imaginations. Each writer builds the labyrinth, and then leads the readers through the myriad possibilities of their tale with a thread like that of Ariadne, guiding them down the paths of their story, wherever it might take them.”For Sigmund Freud, the unconscious resembled the dark corridors and hidden places of a labyrinth. Navigating the chaos of that maze – achieving mastery over it, mapping it, finding one’s way out of it – was the work of psychoanalysis, he told an interviewer in 1927. “Psychoanalysis simplifies life. We achieve a new synthesis after analysis. Psychoanalysis reassorts the maze of stray impulses, and tries to wind them around the spool to which they belong. Or, to change the metaphor, it supplies the thread that leads a man out of the labyrinth of his own unconscious.”The Minotaur’s lair in Chaucer’s The Legend of Good Women is “crinkled to and fro”, and “shapen as the mase is wroght”. To find his way through it, Theseus must use the “clewe of twyne” that Ariadne gives him. The word “clewe” derives from Old English cliwen or cleowen, meaning a rounded mass, or a ball of thread. Eventually it became our word “clue”. It lost its material significance, and retained only its metaphorical meaning. But still, there it is, hidden but present: the clewe is in the clue (and the clue is in the clewe). Every step towards solving a mystery, or a crime, or a puzzle, or the riddle of the self, is a length of yarn tossed us by the helping hand of Ariadne.In Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film The Shining, Jack Torrance, his wife, Wendy, and their son, Danny, move to an isolated hotel, the Overlook, so that Jack can take up a job as its caretaker when it closes for the winter. There is an enormous hedge maze in the hotel’s grounds, and a model showing its complex design on display inside. In one spine-tingling sequence, Kubrick transports the viewer from watching Wendy and Danny rushing joyfully towards the maze, to an image of Jack, inside the hotel, glowering balefully over the tabletop model, in which his wife and child can be seen as curious miniaturised figures. Watching these few seconds of the film, one has the destabilising sensation of being simultaneously above and within the structure. There is a third labyrinth: the hotel itself. It is “such an enormous maze”, says Wendy anxiously, when the couple first arrive, “I feel like I’ll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in”. Breadcrumbs, as we learn from the story of Hansel and Gretel, are not the most effective signs to leave in the confusing expanses of a maze or forest.Young Danny, however, is a true labyrinth-walker. There are famous tracking shots of him riding his trike in loops through the various floors of the hotel, the wheels smooth on the rich rugs of the palatial halls and then bumping and rasping on the parquet. He explores the building’s every inch and discerns its hiding places – as well as, it turns out, its bitter memories and hauntings. Ariadne-like, Danny is alert to the dangers of the place, and at a crucial moment gives his mother a knife, in the same way that the Cretan princess gives Theseus a sword. Danny and his mother will need it, because Jack has become a monster. The boy will finally outwit his murderous father in the snow-filled hedge maze by faking his own footprints, walking backwards into them, allowing them apparently simply to stop, then darting into a side alley and covering his tracks. His deranged father, by now a wild Minotaur, is deceived by these false clues. In his last moments, trapped and defeated in the maze, he simply bellows.The film itself is a labyrinth, for it attracts interpreters who wish to decipher its apparently arcane and secret meanings. There are those who believe that it is an allegory of the Holocaust, others who contend it is really about the genocide of the Native Americans, others who believe it is an occluded confession by Kubrick that he faked footage of the moon landings, others still who say that it contains references to the precise date of the Mayan apocalypse. It is not hard to see why. Kubrick loads his scenes with details, with “clues”: there are significant-seeming objects and numbers and curious visual anomalies (disappearing pieces of furniture, changing props). I find it striking how similar the Overlook appears in its decor, its stately halls and long corridors, to Knossos as reimagined by its 20th-century excavator, Arthur Evans: all those geometric friezes and lofty pillars all those deep‑red chambers.The narrator of Henry James’s story “The Figure in the Carpet”, a critic for a literary journal called The Middle, is convinced that a novelist, Hugh Vereker, has buried an “exquisite scheme”, a “little trick”, in all his works. If only he tries hard enough, he believes, it can surely be decoded. In an encounter between the novelist and the critic at a country-house party, Vereker teasingly tells the young man: “To me it’s exactly as palpable as the marble of this chimney.” The critic asks: “Is it a kind of esoteric message?” Vereker replies: “Ah my dear fellow, it can’t be described in cheap journalese!”His expression reminds me of an exchange at the start of James’s novella The Turn of the Screw, which begins, like Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose, with a prologue that claims the story has been transcribed from an old manuscript. In this case, the narrator remembers an occasion, many years earlier, when friends of his at a country house party were in the mood for telling chilling stories. One of their number, Douglas, recalls that at his home in London is a manuscript, written by a governess he used to know, detailing certain disturbing events that occurred while she was caring for two children on behalf of their absent . It is this story, written “in old, faded ink”, that will form the main narrative of the novella. One of the friends asks whether the governess had been in love with . “The story will tell,” the narrator says. But he is sharply contradicted. “The story won’t tell,” says Douglas, “not in any literal, vulgar way.”In “The Figure in the Carpet”, the narrator and his friends become consumed by the project of discovering the “secret” of Vereker’s books. One of them claims to have cracked the code, and is about to write an article that will “trace the figure in the carpet through every convolution”, but he dies before he is able to do so. The narrator finds himself trapped in Vereker’s puzzle, “shut up in my obsession for ever – my gaolers had gone off with the key”. Vereker’s last novel is called The Right of Way: the artist forges ahead, leaving the interpreters flailing around in the labyrinth.Borges once said, of James and Kafka, “I think that they both thought of the world as being at the same time complex and meaningless.” For them, no pattern. The story will not tell.You are, on the whole, with James and Kafka. But still, is it not possible to live in the complex and meaningless world? The labyrinth is something that you cannot help entering. Once inside it, you have no idea where you are, you feel lost, you are robbed of a sense of direction, but perhaps that does not matter. You will never see the whole design, but you can live with that. There are terrors within the labyrinth but there is also love. The centre may not be where you think it is or where you want it to be. But humans desire pattern and shape and design. They spin thread, they tell stories, they build structures. There is meaning to be made, meaning to be excavated.In her last email to me, Mrs Grammatiki wrote this: “I sometimes imagine that Daedalus, when he designed his labyrinth, must have re-created the ridges and convoluted folds of his own brain in the form of a building, as if it were a self-portrait. Do you not find that an image of the human brain resembles a labyrinth? And if Daedalus’s labyrinth is a diagram of the brain, it is therefore also a symbol of the imagination. It represents the manner in which humans make associations, one thought following another in a long procession, from the edge to the centre to the end. Stories have this comfort to them: they have a beginning and an end. They find a way out of the labyrinth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05e1f1079450fcb79d379bd1b2779ab852ed0f6/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d8209b65014daf8077acbc227754e2","title":"susanna clarke made in bradford","story":"The author on not fitting in, marauding gangs of dogs – and escaping into the hills with hunky King ArthurIn the beginning what made me a storyteller was not so much a place as the lack of a place.My father was a Methodist minister. Methodists had a custom where every four or five years each congregation dismissed their current minister and got a new one – the idea being that they didn’t get stuck with one they didn’t like. What it meant for my brother, my sister and me was that every few years we had to leave home and start again.In the early 1970s we moved to Wibsey, a village on the outskirts of Bradford. Yorkshirefolk, I found, had a strong sense of identity and were intensely proud of their birthplace. The organist at the church explained to me that since I wasn’t actually from Yorkshire I would have to prove myself good enough to live there. I was 13. He was an elderly man and this was his dry northern humour.My brother and I went to school in a bleak council estate, Buttershaw. Ten years later it would achieve fame as the place that produced the playwright Andrea Dunbar who wrote Rita, Sue and Bob Too. At school I brushed up against the life that Dunbar described – no money, little future, casual sex. A sweet, pretty girl lent me her diary to read. She wrote about getting fresh with one of her mother’s boyfriends. She was, I suppose, 14.As a dull, unadventurous daughter of the manse it seemed unlikely that I was ever going to fit in at Buttershaw comprehensive. So I set about systematically disappearing. I made a sort of ghost of myself to walk the corridors and sit in the classrooms. Meanwhile I stayed in my head and told myself stories about the characters I saw on television. My arrival in Bradford had coincided, fortuitously, with the start of Arthur of the Britons, an ITV TV series in which King Arthur was reimagined as a Celtic warlord fighting guerrilla battles against the Saxon invasion. It had two heroes who looked like rock stars, except with swords. If you were 13 it was the most perfect television programme ever made. So, while I appeared to the casual onlooker to be in 70s Bradford, I had actually gone weeks ago to live in fifth-century Wales.Then an odd thing happened Bradford and Arthur of the Britons began to merge into each other. On every wooded hill that surrounded the city – there are many – I visualised Celtic warriors on horseback picking their way through the trees. The West Yorkshire landscape became the landscape of lost ancient Britain.This was the paradox of Bradford (or perhaps the paradox of me): that while it made me feel more of an outsider than ever, I also loved it. It was – and is – full of drama.Buttershaw was filled with dogs that either had no owners or else declined to acknowledge the owners they had. From time to time they formed into a pack and raced from place to place. They were led by an enormous white alsatian. We watched them surge past from the school windows while instructions came over the tannoy not to venture out until they had gone.Wibsey teetered on a hillside, high above the city centre. The earth felt insubstantial, the sky immense. Perspectives of blackened terraces came to abrupt endings streets seemed to fall into the sky. We told each other that our weather came straight from Siberia. Once it snowed on the first of June.The most magnificent buildings in Bradford were Victorian, black with age and in various states of decay. Derelict mills were everywhere, with empty windows full of nothing but sky. We lived in the ruins of a lost civilisation. Glory and romance were in the past, almost out of reach, but there were still warriors in the woods if you believed hard enough.• The Ladies of Grace Adieu by Susanna Clarke is published by Bloomsbury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ec05656797119913f6ffad45e539d2daa8136e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4168943e3233bd671f919b2c2b2f2b","title":"brexit must vote again second referendum","story":"I recently met several people who said they were beginning to feel sorry for Theresa May. Well, up to a point, I should have thought. She apparently wanted to be prime minister from an early age, and is now a victim of what her predecessor from the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harold Macmillan, referred to as “events”.Macmillan’s celebrated remark about “events” has gone down in political history. But, as with so many famous sayings, its full meaning has been lost. When asked what he feared most, he replied “the opposition of events, dear boy”. This was a clever dig at the weakness of the Labour party in the 1950s, which was riven with deep resentment between the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites. Macmillan was not fearful of Her Majesty’s Opposition.In the present case the “event” – the referendum result – occurred before the present prime minister assumed office indeed, that event precipitated her into No 10. And May is not fearful of the opposition, but of her own party. Everywhere I go, I meet people – many of them Conservatives – who sigh for an effective opposition.May could be playing a clever game in which she declares at the 11th hour that she has done her best but has realised that, for the good of the country, the result of the referendum – conducted under false pretences – should be reversed. Unfortunately, while hoping that this might prove the case, I doubt it.At the very least, she has a ided country. With the potential post-Brexit economic horrors mounting by the day, I find it difficult to credit that a second referendum would not show that the nation had come to its\u0026nbspsenses.I myself have been hesitant about a second referendum, believing with the long-departed Edmund Burke that, as he said in his famous speech to the electors of Bristol, parliamentarians are our representatives, not just our delegates, and should be allowed to exercise their own considered judgment in these matters (it being common – indeed Commons – knowledge that the vast majority of MPs regard Brexit as an act of self-harm, not to say economic suicide).However, if our prime minister, cabinet and other elected representatives cannot grasp this Churchillian opportunity for national leadership, the only hope is that they delegate the final say, once again, to the people: by which time one can only hope that the message has got through.There is something truly ridiculous about the government preparing to stock up for a hard Brexit on 29 March 2019 – facing the prospect of wartime shortages of supplies, not least of the vast quantities of food we import daily from “the Continent” – when it is not 1914 or 1939 and the only war we are preparing for is a war on\u0026nbspourselves.All this stuff propagated by Liam Fox, Jacob Rees-Mogg and co about the wonders of the free-trade agreements we could negotiate after Brexit is pie in the sky. We already enjoy countless free-trade agreements via our membership of the EU. And, as the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman recently pointed out, being a member of a customs union is much more important than being party to a free-trade agreement.There are no customs checks within the EU, but there are under the North American Free Trade Agreement that operates between the US and Mexico. Businesses are concerned about the bureaucratic friction that, after Brexit, would impede the “just in time” flow of goods that is an integral part of the modern economy.The apparent agreement last week between the US and EU to defuse Trump’s tariff wars shows the benefit of our being part of a wider trading bloc. The American business executive David Rosen, who has had experience of dealings with Trump, says that the main reason why the mercantilist president wishes to break up the EU is so that he can weaken the bargaining power of the EU in trade negotiations. Given Trump’s behaviour, this sounds all too plausible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/032011a50fed475f15802b813575ce484d8b78b1/0_76_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260ed23d4ef479486e688252c5ef9029","title":"time to purge undesirable scots yes andy murray that means you","story":"Pinkos, nationalists and Remainers – if you’re not worried, you really ought to beIn Britain’s postwar decades, it seems that if your name didn’t appear on a government blacklist then you could never consider yourself an authentic leftie. We all purport to be shocked at how 1950s America went meekly sleepwalking into Senator Joe McCarthy’s paranoid nightmare about the land of the free being kidnapped by the red menace. In Britain, though, the establishment hunt for commie agitators and assorted other undesirables and rum characters has continued to this day.The office of prime minister wasn’t enough to spare Harold Wilson from scrutiny by MI5’s squads of social misfits and sociopaths. Trade unionists, CND activists and people caught in possession of a northern accent in London after 11pm all went into the black book. The state paranoia probably suspected butterfly enthusiasts with an unhealthy interest in red admirals and surly husbands who were partial to chicken Kiev. I wouldn’t be surprised if Bill Shankly’s name were to pop up in some document hitherto protected by a 50-year rule. He was working class, Scottish, loved the Reds and proclaimed that football was like socialism. MI5’s moon-howlers probably awarded Mick McGahey an entire firing squad all to himself in the event that he ever became NUM president.Unsurprisingly, the Soviets chose instead to concentrate on less obvious targets such as the indolent Bullingdon types who inhabited Oxford and Cambridge. Never having been exposed to anyone resembling an authentic working-class person and believing that poverty ended with the Liberal reforms of 1906, some of these chaps were ripe for the plucking once they discovered that not only did poor people still exist but there were many of them and they lived quite near by. Even the prewar House of Windsor was negotiating free passes with the Nazis and making plans to flee to Canada before good old George VI put some backbone into them. Yet despite the lengthy rap-sheet of our ruling classes in treachery and betrayal, it’s always leftie sympathisers who take the hit.Countless miners all over the UK were blackballed from all future employment after 1984 when Margaret Thatcher condemned them as “the enemy within”. The Scottish judiciary conspired with their brethren in the police to hand down draconian sentences to striking miners charged on the flimsiest of evidence. Many of them never worked again. Until very recently, police forces in Scotland were deploying illegal means to spy on troublesome journalists, while some of the largest companies in the UK construction industry have been blacklisting trade union types and other truculent characters for decades.Last week, following the release of papers by the National Archives, we also learned that Thatcher had a secret list of “subversive Scottish nationalists” drawn up in the 1980s. Civil service departments colluded with our “security” services to compile a list of 1,420 “subversives” in Whitehall who were known to harbour unclean thoughts about an independent Scotland. These were the days when suspected tartan-facing mandarins were hiding copies of Scottish newspapers inside their copies of Playboy. They were subsequently denied promotions or moved to departments where the potential for damage was considered to be limited.The current Tory administration at Westminster makes Thatcher’s government look like a gang of Scargillites. Thus, it makes sense that a similar list of dangerous Scottish nationalist scrotes must exist to which new names are being added with every passing week, especially as the prospect of an independent Scotland is much closer now than it ever was in the 1980s.There must be thousands of names on it by now. Obviously Alex Salmond and his successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, must be on it. Indeed, if I were Salmond, I’d be keeping an eye out for any sudden changes in the personnel of his production team at Russia Today. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage will surely have discussed this at some length as they exchanged billets-doux with the Kremlin before the EU referendum.The members of the rock band Mogwai, Andy Murray, assorted lieutenant-colonels in the Tartan Army, Loki the indomitable Scottish rapper: all of them must be on it. If I were them I’d also be keeping a beady eye on the Glasgow comedian and celebrated anti-Trump protester Janey Godley, as well as Craig and Charlie Proclaimer. The Tory MEP David Bannerman has even taken it upon himself to reveal the fate of Remainers who find themselves on the undesirable blacklist: he wants them tried for treason.The sinister web of dark money draws from a deep well of manipulation in Britain’s wretched and ignoble political history. Also to be found there are the agents provocateurs who sowed ideas of sedition during industrial upheaval in the 18th century MI5’s infiltration of the NUM during the 1984 miners’ strike the Diplock courts used in Northern Ireland during the Troubles and the useful C-list idiots in England who all tried to persuade Scots to remain in a suicidal and corrupt United Kingdom. They all have one thing in common: to ensure that pesky stuff such as democratic accountability and the possibility of the wrong type of government can never threaten the ancient privileges of the British elite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

The pizza is amazing. The atmosphere is great. Everyone who walks into the restaurant feels at home. Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

It was certainly fitting afterwards as Manchester United were comprehensively beaten by Liverpool on the latest leg of their US pre-season tour.Xherdan Shaqiri marked his first appearance for Liverpool with a stunning overhead kick and also set up Daniel Sturridge for a cool finish, while penalties from Sadio Mané and Sheyi Ojo added to Mourinho’s problems in the International Champions Cup.The United manager had another dig about the strength of his travelling squad, plus his opponents, before kick-off in the magnificent setting of the ’Big House’. “It’s Liverpool first team versus Manchester United kids,” he said. “For the last two years they have not been able to beat us, today they will think they have a chance.” It was a bit of a stretch considering United started with Alexis Sánchez, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera as captain and Eric Bailly, a late replacement for Chris Smalling, who injured himself in the warm-up, but his prediction about the game itself was prescient.Liverpool, with Mohamed Salah and Mané starting for the first time together this pre-season, were the sharper and more dangerous side throughout. The Egypt and Senegal internationals showed an understanding that United struggled to match with Mata and Sánchez often isolated, although the Chilean forward was a threat whenever he did receive possession. He was less than happy with a series of fouls from behind, however, berating the referee on several occasions.Klopp’s team created three decent openings before taking the lead. Dominic Solanke saw a back-heel flick blocked at the front post and Lee Grant, the United goalkeeper, twice saved from Salah headers. The first was an excellent save from a flick off the back of Salah’s head that seemed destined for the roof of the net.Liverpool edged ahead when Salah, oozing confidence, was felled inside the area by a clumsy challenge from Demetri Mitchell. Mané drove the resulting penalty low and hard beyond Grant’s right hand. During the drinks break that followed in the sweltering heat Mourinho came on to the pitch to complain to referee Ismail Elfath, possibly about the clear penalty, but his team levelled in style only three minutes later.Andreas Pereira enjoyed a strong, disciplined game in the centre of United’s midfield and capped his display with a superb free-kick, swept into the top corner from 25 yards, after Mitchell had been fouled. The flow of the game remained unchanged despite a raft of Liverpool substitutions in the second half, however, with Klopp’s team continuing to dominate. Shaqiri was highly impressive, setting up Sturridge for a fine finish into the bottom corner with his first touch of the game.A second penalty decision, awarded when Herrera was wrongly adjudged to have tripped Andy Robertson, gave Ojo the opportunity to roll a confident penalty past Joel Pereira. Shaqiri then put a stunning overhead kick beyond the United keeper to give the scoreline an accurate reflection of Liverpool’s superiority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd8ed6301158beab387caa104119ed6a620d20a/0_41_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4728d60c3adb689ea2e399141784f64","title":"jurgen klopp praises xherdan shaqiris stunning liverpool debut","story":"Jurgen Klopp admitted he was surprised by Xherdan Shaqiri’s Liverpool debut as the £13m summer signing scored a stunning overhead kick and set up Daniel Sturridge’s goal in the 4-1 defeat of Manchester United.\u0026nbspThe Switzerland international only joined his new team-mates on their US tour on Tuesday having been given an extended break after the World Cup. Shaqiri replaced Mohamed Salah at the interval in the International Champions Cup fixture and delivered an impressive second half display, capped by a superb final goal in Liverpool’s comprehensive win.“That’s not normal after four days in the club, adapting that well to the style of play,” the Liverpool manager said. “We wanted to help him a little bit with the position so that it’s not too complicated. We gave him a lot of freedom, offensively playing natural, plus offering runs in behind, which is what he did especially around the Sturridge goal.Klopp added: “For Shaq, in the moment he signed he wanted to stay immediately at Liverpool and train with us. I think it was a week after he finished the World Cup, so I said: ‘No, no, no. Go’. He came back a few days ago and he was really excited. For him it was very good moment in his career, having already had a real experience at Bayern, at Stoke and at Inter. Those were important moments in his career and now we have him and he can play together with a few really nice football players.”The Liverpool squad flew home immediately after the United game and will start a pre-season training camp in France from Monday.

We left Ireland for Manchester when I was 12, and I was happy to go.My family were wheeler-dealer class. They were their own bosses and very glamorous. We lived in a beautiful, big townhouse in Arklow, in Ireland, that we couldn’t afford to heat. My father had a business fitting bar furniture and my mother is an antiques dealer. One night my father woke me up because he’d come home with a horse. Two days later I asked my mother where it was and she said it had run away. She’d sold it.Realising I’d become a gay icon felt like home. In the early part of my career I used to play in Paris with Moloko and it would always be this dry, trip-hop audience of mostly music journalists. Then one day I turned up and it was wall-to-wall men with their tops off, hanging from the ceiling, sweat pouring everywhere. I thought: “This is it! I’ve found my niche.”I can blag it at Irish dancing. But there was no Gaelic, no Irish songs, no Irish dancing in my childhood. My parents were modern Irish. I’m more into it than them.

Being a parent has driven me to use time more economically. I’ve been fighting the system for a long time. I’ve never operated like a so-called “music professional”. I work hard to bring beauty to life, but at the moment the people close to me in this have never been further away.

No surprise there. What was a surprise was the reaction of Nikesh’s co-workersI’ve been thinking about this old boss I once had. He had a habit of asking me if I knew different people of South Asian descent. Once, in a staff meeting, he told us all a story about how in the 70s, he had been in court for a minor offence. There had been two Indian women on the jury. He looked at me. “You probably knew them,” he said.“No,” I replied. “I don’t know every single South Asian person in the world, I’m afraid.”I left that meeting shaking. This was the latest in a long line of questions about different brown people. The week before he had asked if I was related to a Bengali work acquaintance. “No,” I had replied. “I’m not.”Back in the office, I was fuming. My colleagues filtered back into our little room and raised their eyebrows at me. One of them sniggered. “Wow,” they said. “That was… er, interesting.”“It was way worse than that,” I replied. “It was racist.”“Oh no,” they said, their tone changing, their shoulders stiffening. “Oh, definitely not. He’s just old fashioned and harmless. Don’t worry about him.”I was shaken by that comment. Just so we’re clear: I was the only person of colour in the organisation. And while everyone in the staff meeting was a bit embarrassed for me, no one seemed to understand how humiliating it was to be othered in that way. To imply you’re related to every South Asian also comes with the implicit assumption you speak for your entire community, that you are all one unit. It has the effect of stripping away iniduality. Because it does sound harmless and old-fashioned. But at the same time, it sounds ridiculous and othering and shines a spotlight on you as the only person of colour in the room.I was more disappointed in my colleague who wanted to downplay the comment that it doesn’t matter that my feelings were irrelevant because it was totally OK for our boss to be old fashioned and out of touch. And no attempt should be made to educate him.I left the job not long afterwards.I’ve been thinking about that boss recently because at events, time and again, I’m asked: “What can I do? How can I be a better ally? How can I combat ignorance and racism?”I always say, you could ensure you’re not being dismissive of said ignorance and racism when it’s close to home. We all have a duty to call these things out when we see them. Especially when the people are those in our circles, who we see, eat with, give presents to, hang out with and visit. Start there. Of course, we’re all entitled to our different beliefs, but if you think what’s being said is ignorant and harmful, then say so and say it in a way that you feel you would be receptive to if someone were to pull you up on something similar.I get things wrong all the time. We all do. Before sitting down to write this, I made a joke about my uncle’s outfit that he took offence to even though I meant it lovingly. He explained to me, calmly, the way in which I had made him feel bad – and I apologised.How we choose to bring these things up is important to bear in mind. Because I think about that boss and how easy it was for my colleague to dismiss him as old fashioned. Saying that strips what he has to say of threat and harm, regardless of whether I felt it.And I was the one the comments were directed to. I think about him because we’ve all come across someone like him, who continues to say these things because no one corrects him, his words go unchecked and his opinion is dismissed as irrelevant. It does him harm, too. To not be corrected. And it does me a disservice, to assume that, sitting there, being asked repeatedly whether I know every single person of South Asian descent on the planet. It’s not enough to smile and shake my head and think: “Oh, how old fashioned.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e84484bed792f8878c0ba186610bd0281aefdca/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f2ceb35f9538603a90f5c337a09c334","title":"underworld iggy pop teatime dub encounters review","story":"(Caroline International)The joyous product of a recording session for Trainspotting 2, Iggy Pop’s EP with Underworld finds rock’n’roll’s chief hedonist in reckless and reflective mode There are few, if any, opening shots in rock more magnificent than that fired off by Iggy Pop in 1973. “I’m a street-walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm,” he snarled – probably shirtless and bleeding – at the start of Search and Destroy.The track was a glam rock meditation inspired by the Vietnam war, and Search and Destroy – and Iggy himself – somehow came to encapsulate a central contradiction of rock’n’roll: how destructive nihilism could simultaneously express joie de vivre – gloriously damaged, but joie de vivre nonetheless.“If I had wings, I wouldn’t do anything beautiful or transcendent,” he offers, an impossible 45 years later, on Bells \u0026amp Circles – the first track on an entirely unexpected EP recorded with electronic heroes Underworld. Although released in the dead of summer, Teatime Dub Encounters is a short set too inviting to dismiss as an addendum to two already fabled careers. It’s an encounter that has dragged Iggy out of semi-retirement when he had vowed never to record another album, or tour, again.“No!” he continues louchely on Bells \u0026amp Circles, as Rick Smith’s percussive undercarriage chunters along, “I’d get my finger into everything I wanted.” Iggy goes on to mourn smoking on aeroplanes, and hoovering up lines of coke on tray tables while propositioning the cabin crew. In passing, he also regrets the passing of liberal democracy. “Sunlight, on my wings,” interjects Karl Hyde, Underworld’s enduringly impressionistic singer, trying to crowbar the dial back towards more beatific vibes.Teatime Dub Encounters began as an attempt by the two opposite ends of the original soundtrack to Danny Boyle’s 1996 film Trainspotting – Iggy Pop, with Lust for Life, and Underworld, with Born Slippy (Nuxx) – to cook up something for the sequel, 2017’s T2. As Iggy told Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh over cream tea and scones in a recent interview for Q, Underworld essentially ambushed Iggy while he was staying at the Savoy last year. He was on tour with his last album, Post Pop Depression – at the time, suspected to be Iggy’s final word set to music. “I’m tired of people looking at me all the time,” he said then of his winding down. “What I enjoy most in my life are my secret hours.”As kismet would have it, his Post Pop Depression was released on the same day in 2016 as Underworld’s equally well-received latt erday album, Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future: two artists not content to rest on their hedonistic reputations. Time was tight. Smith had even set up half a studio in a hotel room, poised to strike if Iggy said yes. Bounced into it, Iggy went into raconteur mode and they were away, two men in their 50s and 60s and one in his 70s, Iggy essentially improvising. On these four tracks, they nod to 70s heroes Suicide on Trapped, in which Iggy sneers at mortgages – a line that dovetails nicely with the original Trainspotting’s “choose life” diatribe.Iggy also ruminates on friendship – one of the central themes of T2 – on I’ll See Big. The final track, Get Your Shirt, nods to the frontman’s perennial toplessness, but actually discusses how he has lost his shirt to The Man a few too many times. As it turned out, these songs did not fit into the film: there is too much going on.On Bells \u0026amp Circles, Iggy is quick to conform to rascal type. Consider, though, his use of the word “transcendent”. Since the heyday of the Stooges, Iggy Pop – born James Osterberg 71 years ago – has been the poster boy for a mythical recklessness. Like Keith Richards, he has ingested more raw power than is prudent, and has parlayed that margin-walking cachet into umpteen guest appearances, semi-regular doses of advertising money and a surprisingly enduring afterlife as a chuckling survivor of wilder times. The contradiction embodied in Search and Destroy was expressed once again in 1977, when the solo Iggy released Lust for Life, his best-known track. It told the rest of the world what Stooges fans already knew: that Iggy “was worth a million in prizes”, and that he could make a desperate struggle with heroin addiction sound like a lot of fun.His shop-soiled joie de vivre has now matured into a lizardly avuncularity in which he flexes his sharp mind on a range of subjects – surprisingly affecting in his candour, for one so previously numbed or dangerous. His cheetah-ish form has long been maintained by qigong. Post Pop Depression found him actually crooning, like some kind of midwestern chansonnier, but bits of Teatime Dub Encounters actually recall Giorgio By Moroder on Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories album – another example of a legendary figure from the annals of hedonism calmly telling his war stories.Iggy knows full well he has what it takes to be going for “transcendent”: this urbane elder statesman has always had considerable intellect, no doubt exceeding the expectations of those who assumed he would OD well before his friend and collaborator David Bowie. Iggy was always a wild man well-versed in the blues and minimalism, who – despite releasing an album entitled The Idiot – was no savage savant. His 2014 John Peel lecture took a rheumy-eyed look at the music industry under capitalism, and featured polysyllables, and his radio show has lit up 6 Music for some years now.So you might come to Teatime Dub Encounters – a most English half-smile of titles, one that echoes the rueful cosiness of another Underworld opus, Second Toughest in the Infants – for the antic misdemeanours, or for the latterday Dylanish radio drawl, but you will stay for the way Iggy confesses that he has always struggled to make friends and keep the ones he’s got – the gist of I’ll See Big. As he tells it, the young Osterberg found some other guys who had no friends. It’s the ur-myth of a lot of bands – at least, the ones formed of cranky outsiders rather than careerists.“Hey, is that me?” asks Iggy at the start of the track. Yes, you conclude, it probably is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d721a181f00a40e8e7fefdf33782d5cadb54e33/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6735fcde8f7f66b58feb6fd8c610a66b","title":"bitter learned life inside john massey","story":"John Massey, the UK’s longest-serving prisoner, talks about his four escapes and how the prison system has changedJohn Massey sits in a cafe called the Breakout, opposite Pentonville prison in north London. It’s six years since he broke out himself, scaling the nearby prison wall with a makeshift rope and hook. He was 64. Scotland Yard warned the public that the convicted murderer was potentially dangerous and should not be approached. Two days later, he was caught and sent back.But in May this year, Massey was released after nearly 43 years in jail, he was the UK’s longest serving prisoner. Today, over a breakfast of bacon and bubble and squeak, he stares at Pentonville’s walls with a mixture of relief and nostalgia.Massey’s is an astonishing story – one of criminality and violence, regret and loss, humour and chutzpah, love and loyalty. This is a man who escaped prison or breached licence conditions four times, in order to be with relatives who were very ill. He paid for it by serving more than twice his original sentence.One night in 1975, Massey was in the Cricketers pub in Clapton, east London, when a friend (also called John) became involved in a brawl with a bouncer, Charlie Higgins. Massey claims that his friend was stabbed in the eye with a broken bottle. “We were on our way out when all the trouble started. We heard these terrible, piercing screams and I looked round and thought, ‘Where’s John?’ and he was in the middle of it. We had to go in and get him. We took a few whacks with baseball bats and dragged him out. My overwhelming memory of that evening is horror. Seeing my friend’s face with his eye hanging out. People can’t do that to another human being. I was really full of hatred and, before it could fizzle out, I went and done the deadly damage.”First, Massey and another friend took the injured man to hospital. “We had a local place where we had guns stored,” he says. “As soon as we dropped him off, we got tooled up and went back.” Massey comes to a stop. Eventually he speaks: “Obviously I wish we hadn’t, but there we go.” Massey shot Higgins in the chest at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun. At the age of 26, he was sentenced to life for murder the judge recommended he serve a minimum of 20 years.Today, Massey is accompanied by his sister, Jane, 10 years younger but a dead ringer for her brother. She listens as he talks about the murder, and how he has changed over the years. “You mellow as you get older, and obviously you have regrets,” Jane says. “He was young and stupid. It was a moment of madness and you can’t turn back the clock, unfortunately.” She often thinks of the life he could have had – as a cabinetmaker or teaching carpentry in college, “because his woodwork is second to none”.Their father was a well-regarded builder, known locally as Jack the Plasterer, who also ended up in jail for stealing lead from a church roof. Massey’s mother struggled to raise their six small children alone, and young John was taken into care. “I remember it clear as day,” he says. “My mum was walking along a country road in Henley-on-Thames. We got to this house and a skinny, tall woman came out with a starched wing collar. They had a little discussion and took me into the garden, and there was this brand new shiny red tricycle with a little boot on the back. So I’m riding merrily around the garden and next time I turn around, my mum’s gone. I screamed blue murder.”From a childhood in care, Massey moved to an approved school (because he was badly behaved), then to a borstal, because he’d started stealing, and finally prison. Despite his skill as a carpenter, he was more committed to crime and became an armed bank robber.When he was sent to prison, Massey’s two oldest sisters, Jackie and Sue, who had no criminal record, were sentenced to three years for harbouring him in their homes. Jackie’s young son was severely disabled, while Sue had three children, and Massey felt he owed them. Then, a few months into his sentence, his younger brother Terry killed himself. “It battered our family,” Massey says. “I could have saved him if I’d been there. You can’t say goodbye, and it hurts for the rest of your life.” He promised himself that, if his family were in trouble, he would, somehow, be there for them.Having lost one son, Massey’s parents were terrified John would kill himself in jail. Instead, he says, he felt emboldened. “I thought, ‘I’m not going to kill myself, but it would be legitimate for me to die in combat, as it were.’ So I fought back, which was kind of stupid, but it got me peace in the end.”The violence dished out to prisoners in the 1970s and 80s was extraordinary, Massey says. “In 1975, the whole British penal system was based on brutality and ignorance. They only employed ex-squaddies as screws: hobnailed boots, bulging muscles with tattoos. Everything was force.” Football violence was then at its peak and Massey says the guards reminded him of hooligans. “When people get a kicking at football, it’s hysteria – you can’t stop it. It was like that. All you can do is curl up in a ball and try to weather the storm.”Shortly before Massey’s 20 years were up, in 1994, he was told he would not be released. He had hardly been a model prisoner, but he felt he had done his time, acknowledging the murder and the huge suffering he had caused Higgins’ family. He decided to take matters into his own hands. When he was granted a home visit to see his father, who was recuperating from a stroke, he slipped away from the two officers sent to guard him the four of them were in the pub – his father in his wheelchair, the prison staff playing pool – when Massey escaped through a toilet window. He headed to Spain via a car boot, a contact’s private plane and a night at the George V hotel in Paris. (After his first restaurant meal out of captivity, Massey called over the maitre d’ to tell him the food was fine but required a little more cinnamon.)In Spain, Massey lived as a free man for nearly two years. “All the family came over regularly. One Christmas we had nephews, nieces, grandnephews, grandnieces – it was wonderful.” His girlfriend gave birth to a son, whom they lost to cot death at four months. They began drinking heavily. “I went a little bit crazy. We both did.”One day, they were in a bar in Fuengirola and his girlfriend was crying. “It was deserted except for three guys at the corner table. She went to the ladies to clean herself up. She had to pass these three English guys, who were making comments, pissed. They said, ‘Who’s upset you, darling, that cunt over there?’” Massey says one of them hit him on the head with a bar stool and that he fought back. He was convicted of grievous bodily harm. It didn’t take the Spanish authorities long to discover he was on the run. The British wanted him back, but the Spanish refused to deport him back to a life sentence (there is no equivalent in Spain). After a year of legal wrangling, he was returned to the UK.Massey has nothing but praise for the Spanish justice system. “They’ve got a completely different attitude. Once a year, they choose a few prisoners out of the whole population and pardon them as a gesture of goodwill. You’d never get that in a million years over here. And you’ve got conjugal visits, so you can increase your family while you’re doing time. If your wife’s been nicked with you, you can even stay in the same cell. Anything they can do to keep the family together. Over here, it’s the opposite. If you were born in London, they’ll put you up in Durham.”Massey claims the Spanish agreed to deport him only on the proviso that he could not be returned to a life sentence. “I had to go to the biggest court in the land, in front of three judges. They decided they could circumnavigate their constitution by putting a provision in the extradition warrant.” He has no copy of this warrant, and is desperate to get hold of one if Massey breaches his current licence conditions – if he is late for an appointment, or argues with his probation officer – he could still be recalled to prison on a life sentence. “And I cannot get within 100 miles of getting a copy. They block me at every twist and turn, because if I got it ratified, everybody would get what I got.”Massey was finally released from Sudbury prison in Derbyshire to a probation hostel in 2007. A few months later, he was told his father was dying in hospital. When he asked for an extension of his curfew to stay with him, it was refused. He stayed at the hospital anyway, until his father passed away four days later. Massey gave himself up and was sent back to prison.It was another two and a half years before he was granted open conditions again, at Ford prison in Sussex. Then, in May 2010, he discovered his sister, Carol, was terminally ill. Refused permission to visit her in hospital, he walked out of the gates and stayed with her until she died two weeks later. This time, he did not give himself up but went to live at his mother’s house in Camden, north London, waiting for “the knock on the door”. It eventually came 10 months later, and he was returned to jail – this time, the closed, category B Pentonville.Is Massey as anti-authoritarian as the prison authorities say? “I’m not anti-authority. I’m not an anarchist. I believe in the rule of law, otherwise there would be complete chaos. I’m anti-hypocrisy.” What does he mean? “Well, I said to one prison governor, ‘What if a member of your family had just been in a road accident and was in intensive care, and your boss says, “Hold on, I can’t spare you”?’ And he said, ‘I’d say, bollocks, I’m leaving.’ I said, ‘Exactly! So what d’you have me down for?’”In June 2012, Massey was told his mother had an aggressive brain tumour and was near death. If he were to reach her in time, this escape had to be more audacious than the previous three. And it was: at 64, he went over the wall.We pay the bill and leave the Breakout. Massey looks healthier than when we first met him a few years ago. My colleague Eric and I were helping Pentonville prisoners produce a newspaper, Voice Of The Ville, and Massey turned up to a class, pale and gaunt.Today, he takes us round the back of the prison to show us how he escaped. A row of terrace houses – staff accommodation – lines one side of the wall. Massey was working in the gym and escaped using netting from a five-a-side goal to make thin but strong rope. He says he was hurt by reports that he had worked in the gym only as part of an escape plan. “They’ve always tried to say that, that I’m manipulative and scheming. But I was building a new woodwork shop where you could teach people the basics in carpentry, plumbing and electricity, and it was actually the gym that headhunted me. I renovated all the machines, otherwise it would have cost them seven grand. I never even thought about escaping, at first.”That changed when he heard his mother was ill. He knew from a stint in Pentonville in the 70s that there was a padlocked hatch in one of the toilets that led to the roof. He undid the padlock and hid in the gym. At 6pm, he opened the hatch, climbed on to the roof and went over the wall.Massey is staring at that very wall as we talk. “I released the rope too soon. It got twisted around my wrist and as I tried to loosen it, it just slipped all the way down. I fell 20ft.” He looks up at the barbed wire at the top. “It looks high now. I’m terrified of heights. But when you’ve got a job to do, it’s do or die.” He broke his foot as he hit the ground. “I almost landed at a screw’s feet. He was walking home. His eyes were like saucers. ‘John, what the fuck are you doing?’ ‘Sorry, mate,’ I said, ‘I ain’t got time to rabbit’ and I flew for the next wall and straight over. Just froze, he did.”Massey spent a couple of days with his mother, then moved to Kent, where he was caught. “I was in a house where the people had just gone on holiday, thinking I was safe. I was watching Wimbledon on the telly when the doors burst open. So I must have been grassed.”As he talks, a woman emerges from a house behind the prison’s wicket gate. “What are you doing?” she asks Massey.“I escaped from here in 2012 – oldest prisoner ever to climb that wall.”She looks closely at him. “‘Oh my goodness,” she says.“I know your face,” Massey says. “You were on A wing?”“Yes, I’m a psychologist. Hello, John, you all right?”“I’m not on the run. I was released a few weeks ago.”“That’s good to hear,” she says.He shows her his copy of the local paper, which has a story about his release. “Nice to see you out,” she says.‘Nice to see you.”Has she got time for a group photo? “No, I’d better not,” she says. “Take care of yourself, John.”She leaves. For a moment, it looked to me as if Massey might get arrested for trying to break into Pentonville prison.When Massey was recaptured, the prison authorities were furious. He was sent to the high-security Belmarsh jail, where he says he was given a tough time. “One governor said, ‘You have upset a lot of people, Massey.’ I said, ‘It’s nothing personal. I just wanted to see my mum.’ The governor said, ‘You ruined a lot of lives.’ Some people got the sack because my escape was made during a security audit.”One morning, Massey claims, he was in the exercise yard when two men in paramilitary uniform approached him. “They’re the dedicated search team, the elite squad. They called me in for a cell search. When I got back, there were eight of them standing outside my cell. As soon as they got me in, they steamed in, hit me from behind first, then got me on the floor and carried on. They must have been beating me for five minutes. If it wasn’t for my experience and my fitness, at my age, I don’t think I would have survived.”When asked to comment, a Prison Service spokesperson said: “A complaint by Mr Massey was investigated by HMP Belmarsh, the police and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, and no further action was taken.”Still, Massey says prison is not as violent as when he was first locked up. He was regularly beaten then, and chemically coshed. “Once, a doctor broke a needle in me when I was struggling – like a horse needle. It doesn’t knock you out, it just immobilises you. I remember lying on the floor of this padded cell, staring up at the ceiling. I couldn’t drag my eyes off it.” What was the justification? “Unmanageable. They wanted me in body belts, and if you were struggling, everything had to be done by force.”These days, he says, the brutality tends to be more psychological. Mental health problems, self-harm and drug addiction have all increased. Ironically, Massey believes this is due to the introduction of a zero tolerance policy on drugs. He talks about a particular category A prison in the 70s: “The governor was an Old Etonian sergeant major type. He’d walk around the prison. That was when people were having a bit of puff. So he’d open the cell door and there’d be six or eight people sitting in a cell laughing, the music’s on, having a good time, nobody wanted to fight. He’d open the door and go, ‘Mmmm, smells interesting! Have a good evening, chaps.’ As long as you weren’t smashing the gaff up or hurting people, he didn’t give a rat’s arse. He ran a smooth prison.”That all changed when mandatory drug tests (MDTs) were introduced in 1994, Massey says. “That’s when heroin started creeping in, because cannabis stays in the system for 28 days and heroin only three. They started going for heroin at weekends, when there are no drug tests. So there aren’t enough smackheads outside, and you want to start creating them inside? Now they want to stamp on the heroin, so inmates are on synthetic psychedelic drugs like spice that don’t show up on MDTs. They lost the war on drugs when they started it.” If government ministers really want to know how to run a safe prison, he says, they should ask people like him. “Who’s the expert: the man who’s done 43 years, or the man who’s done the fast-track and read the textbook?”Now that he’s been released, Massey has no intention of being recalled. He thinks he would have struggled to adapt to the outside world without the occasional taste of life on the outside: “Having the odd break kept me sane.” When he is allowed to leave his hostel, will he move in with his sister? God, no, Jane says. “It’s brilliant having him out, but that wouldn’t be good for either of us. It’s important he has his own little flat, because I don’t want to get on his nerves and he doesn’t want to get on mine. He’s a messy bastard and I’m tidy.”As for Massey, of course he has regrets, and none bigger than the night he took the life of Charlie Higgins. “When you can see the immensity of what you’ve done, the hugeness of what you’ve lost and destroyed, it smashes you to bits.” He also has regrets about the way he behaved in jail. “There comes a time when you start getting bitter and resentful, and you’re making them right about the need to lock you up.”The one thing he has no regrets about is escaping to see his family when they needed him – even if the consequence was an extra 23 years. “Soon after I saw Mum, she started losing her memory, so I got in at the right time. I had a few precious moments with her, and they can never steal those off me.” He is loving life on the outside. He is down at his local gym every morning, where by chance he works out alongside former head of the Crown Prosecution Service and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer. He recently spent an hour with Starmer, telling him his story – and why he’s desperate to remain a free man. “I’m as determined to stay out of jail as any man could be. I’m not going to live as long as I served, and I’ve got a lot to repay people.”• If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a23478bd2f4ebe462e6b4ac715d6f2297fff009/0_127_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54b21c87c29e4d444d58bd7d5afe1a3a","title":"housing renting mortgages loans home ownership first time buyers","story":"Government should help millions get on the housing ladderYoung people struggling to buy their first home should be offered loans by the government to help them pay the deposit, according to a new report which warns that reduced home ownership and the recent surge in private renting is damaging family life.The idea has been put forward by the Housing and Finance Institute (HFI) as one of several initiatives it believes necessary to increase the number of homeowners by one million by 2035. As with the current system of student loans, the HFI suggests the loans could be repaid as a proportion of salary once the recipient has reached a certain income threshold.Alternatively the money could be repaid under a simple repayment arrangement, although at a low interest rate and over a long term. The loans would be written off after 40 years or at state retirement age, whichever comes first.With six million more people now living in short-term rented housing than 15 years ago, the HFI says urgent action is needed to boost home ownership, as evidence mounts that a good and stable family home has beneficial effects on people’s health, their sense of economic stability, and children’s educational attainment. Natalie Elphicke, chief executive of the HFI and a former adviser to the government on housing, said: “The 15-year experiment of expanding the private rented sector on a huge scale has failed. It has left too many people facing exorbitant rents for poor-quality homes, with severe detrimental effects on their living standards and future opportunities. The evidence is compelling. It is time for a rethink.“It is high time we introduced a strategy that incorporated both social housing and home ownership as priorities, instead of peddling the usual narrative that one is good and the other bad. We need a fresh perspective to ensure we don’t just provide more and more homes, but that we provide good homes for all generations We need to move away from the current emphasis on the private-rented sector.“The younger generations face triple difficulty in that they have less access to social housing, less access to home ownership and pay the highest rents compared to their pay. We need radical new measures to help the younger generation and to regain a balanced, fair housing market.”The report, co-written with the housing association Radian, suggests poor-quality homes and high levels of private renting  are also having a negative effect on labour market mobility, with fewer people moving for work than in previous decades.“This fall in housing mobility has damaged the economy as fewer people are moving for work, especially younger people,” it says. “It also means younger people are losing out on the wage boost that comes with labour market mobility.”It also says prospective first-time buyers could be offered a “first home deposit tax allowance” under which the mortgage interest on their repayments could be deducted from tax – effectively reinstating the old Miras mortgage interest tax relief system. The authors say that, while this would mean an additional short-term cost to the Treasury, it would boost personal savings over a lifetime while reducing inequality, and produce longer-term gains to the exchequer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e76c8e021337349161defe2953fc86102da05a/246_165_4427_2657/master/4427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597dfe78e8eb5c19056324a655d19855","title":"jos buttler ipl test india england","story":"• “I feel like I have learned a hell of a lot”• Buttler says Adil Rashid is bowing as well as he has seenWith all the arguments about the recall of Adil Rashid, Jos Buttler’s presence in the Test team slips under the radar. After two satisfactory matches against Pakistan his inclusion is no longer a topic of debate despite the fact that he has barely played any red-ball cricket either.Increasingly, Buttler has a safe pair of hands on and off the field. In the recent ODI series he has had the best view of Rashid’s fine form from behind the stumps. Speaking at the launch of the Specsavers Test series Buttler said: “He is bowling as well as I have ever seen him bowl. I am excited for him.”After his IPL experience with the Mumbai Indians and the Rajasthan Royals Buttler is familiar with India and the Indian cricketers. “They are a fantastic team – in all conditions now. Australia is a huge series for England but in this day and age India are not far behind.”Virat Kohli has suggested the series might be more cordial because of the IPL connection. “Not on the pitch but maybe at the training ground or in the lunch room‚” said Buttler. “Moeen played with Virat at RCB and I saw them getting on well. I have played with Hardik Pandya so you are open to having a chat. But I’m sure there will be moments in the series when those things will be forgotten. It will be highly competitive.”Buttler always highlights the benefits of the IPL experience. “I feel like I have learned a hell of a lot from watching guys train and go about their practice and the way they react to pressure moments in a game.“Someone like Kohli is immensely talented but you see his mentality of getting to the top, likewise with other players, David Warner and Steve Smith at Sunrisers. It is the hunger to do it day in day out in training that really shines through in those top players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b309659696a91d46fed762ec1494266e6107139/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0f6269979705a6832d37026a9720fe","title":"kirsten wild ride london classique marianne vos wiggle high5","story":"• Dutch rider temporarily lifts gloom for Wiggle High5• Team announced this week they are to shut downKirsten Wild powered to victory in a sprint finish on the Mall to win the RideLondon Classique just days after her Wiggle High5 team announced this would be their final season.Wild left her move characteristically late but overtook her Dutch compatriot in the final few metres of the 64.1km Women’s World Tour race.

This was Doyle’s third Group One win in little more than a month, and his second in eight days after an equally well-judged ride on Sea Of Class in the Irish Oaks. Doyle’s talent and intelligence in the saddle have long been apparent and he has now added the self-assurance that comes only with repeated success at the highest level.There were several moments on on Saturday when a rider with less confidence might have tried to force the issue, to make up for the slow start when Poet’s Word was sitting behind all but one of his six rivals for much of the race.The most significant of these was Crystal Ocean, a stable companion at Sir Michael Stoute’s yard in Newmarket, and ridden by William Buick, Doyle’s closest friend in the weighing room. Buick, unlike Doyle, had been able to settle his mount in an ideal position just behind a strong pace, ready to strike in the straight.Doyle would need to deliver his challenge late and his task was further complicated when Coronet, the horse he was following, started to drop away and effectively handed Buick another couple of lengths to play with.Crystal Ocean hit the front at the two-furlong pole with Doyle in headlong pursuit. Poet’s Word edged closer with every stride but it was only in the final few yards that he managed to push his nose in front. Poet’s Word had set off as the 7-4 second-favourite behind Crystal Ocean at 6-4 and while Doyle said that he was confident “from a furlong out that he was always going to get there”, it was a race that gripped the spectators until the final moment.“He’s a true warrior,” Doyle said. “Everything he does, he’s so professional and he responds really well.Buick gave Crystal Ocean the ideal ride for a proven stayer up against a slightly speedier opponent, while Stoute, who was winning the King George for a record sixth time, also deserves huge credit for getting both horses to the starting gate in prime condition barely a month after wins at the Royal meeting.“They are two wonderful, brave athletes,” said Stoute, who first took the race with Shergar in 1981. “There’s nothing between them really. It’s a race we’ve always loved to come and compete in and win. It’s a midsummer championship at a wonderful racecourse.”Stoute, typically, offered no hint of where Poet’s Word or Crystal Ocean might race next, though the winner is the new favourite with most bookmakers for next month’s Juddmonte International Stakes at York.“It’s a pity there was a loser,” he said. “That’s how to sum it up. Doyle could have done a little bit better and got a dead-heat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8673eb2ee57332ed76ef341bb3b98fde03151b6/0_66_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a78cbbb2cd1d60ef5ec5a385eb47ff9","title":"andrew morris texas british politician immigration","story":"Andrew Morris, 32, says his first-hand experience of US immigration and universal healthcare can help him win listenersTexas is traditionally portrayed as a fiercely patriotic state. The kind of state that revels in all-American, conservative politicians. On the face, it doesn’t seem the sort of place where a liberal British politician could win office.But Andrew Morris, a 32-year-old originally from Yorkshire, is bidding to do just that.Morris, who moved to Texas 10 years ago, is running for a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He’s retained his northern English accent – if it has developed a slight transatlantic lilt – and he says that makes him a curiosity when he turns up on doorsteps making his progressive pitch for more school funding, more investment in healthcare, and higher public sector wages.“I think it captures people’s attention a little more because they want to hear what this strange-sounding guy has to say,” Morris says.“I make it part of my pitch – I just make a joke about it. I go off on a segue about how I’m possibly more patriotic than a lot of my audience because I chose to move here, and who else in the audience can say that kind of thing?”Morris was born in Rotherham before moving to Warrington and later Brighton, following his father’s career. When he was 17, the family moved to Australia, and it was there that he struck up a pen-pal correspondence with his now wife, a native Texan. In 2008, Morris moved to Texas on a student visa, and he became a passport-holding citizen two years ago.As an immigrant himself, he is not afraid to talk about a more inclusive approach to immigration and undocumented immigrants – which is anathema to many in the south.His background, however, sometimes means people are more receptive to his ideas.“Hearing from someone who has gone through the immigration process, they are really open and really curious about what I think of the whole situation,” Morris says.“I have some insight into how expensive it is, how long it is and how opaque of a process it can be. I have a sense about the challenges that immigration reform entails.”Morris co-founded a group backing Bernie Sanders during the Vermont senator’s run for president, and he is running as a progressive in Texas House district 64. One of the things he will be able to focus on as a state representative is education: specifically classroom size and teachers’ pay. Another area Morris says he is particularly able to speak to is healthcare. He is a proponent of Medicare-for-all – which would provide free healthcare to everyone in the US – and says his first-hand experience of living in countries with universal healthcare helps him allay people’s suspicions.“There’s no reason why the US, with all of their riches and all of the opportunities that it has, should trail everyone else among the most economically developed countries in the world. Nowhere else do you become bankrupt because of a medical condition,” Morris says.“I use my experiences in the UK and Australia to show that the level of rhetoric, especially from the conservative side of the political spectrum, isn’t based in any sort of reality.”“There are more Democrats than Republicans. But what I saw in previous cycles was that the Democratic candidate didn’t really run a campaign or organize effectively,” Morris said.“That’s what going to be different about this cycle – the energy and enthusiasm that a lot of people have, especially because of the current White House occupant. There’s something different about this cycle that will encourage more Democrats to come out.”If Morris does win, he’ll serve a two-year term in the Texas state house in Austin alongside 149 other representatives. At a time where there is tension between the US and the UK, perhaps a Brit in Texas could help to repair relations a little."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488233a79ddc4f8c9c221dfb85387854bd0a433f/0_0_6361_3816/master/6361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb4a16456aab4ccd5e463caa5ed4304c","title":"zimbabwe restive election leaders zanu pf","story":"Monday’s election is looking closer than the ruling Zanu-PF party would like. Could it be the first liberation movement in the region voted out of power?After the music and the singing and the long weeks of campaigning, after the shouts of “power to the people” and “Viva”, President Emmerson Mnangagwa made a final appeal to the people of Zimbabwe on Saturday.“We are reaching the end of a long road and are at the beginning of a new era,” Mnangagwa told the crowd in the national stadium on the outskirts of Harare, the capital. “What is wanted now is one push to have the most thunderous victory in the history of this country.”Early on Monday, polls will open in the first election since Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule was ended by a military takeover nine months ago. The vote will determine the future of the former British colony for decades.The poll pits Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old stalwart of the ruling Zanu-PF party, who succeeded Mugabe, against Nelson Chamisa, a 40-year-old lawyer and pastor who leads the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Zimbabwe’s main opposition.The most recent published survey put Mnangagwa, a dour former spy chief and aide of Mugabe known as “the Crocodile”, three points ahead of Chamisa. Zanu-PF’s internal polling suggests a wider margin, but one which is still too close for the ruling party to be comfortable.Saturday’s rally was supposedly the climax of the Zanu-PF campaign – but it cannot have reassured party strategists. Even with the considerable organisational power of the party fully deployed, the stadium was far from full, applause was desultory, and hundreds were pouring through the exits before the president’s speech was over.The opposition is confident of victory. At a noisy rally last week in Chitungwiza, a satellite town of Harare, Chamisa told supporters the stakes were high. The “elderly” Mnangagwa should step aside for a new generation and a new style of politics, Chamisa told the Observer as he came down from the podium. “Zimbabwe does not need a big man,” he said – a reference to the autocrats across Africa who rule for decades – but “a big idea”.Chamisa’s words have a resonance and relevance in his own country and beyond. In Ethiopia, a new 42-year-old prime minister’s spectacular reforms and promise of multiparty democracy has inspired many more living elsewhere on the continent.Across southern Africa, it is striking how many parties which came to power decades ago after winning liberation struggles against colonial powers or white supremacist regimes remain in charge many decades later.In Zimbabwe, Zanu-PF has long claimed a right to rule based on its victory in the brutal wars of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet this heritage is a double-edged sword as the party tries to distance itself from the disastrous economic legacy of Mugabe’s misrule. Election videos have featured images of the guerrilla war but not of the former dictator, who led the party through the conflict before taking power.Party loyalists argue that the dictator betrayed Zanu-PF and its principles. Constantino Chiwenga, the vice-president, said that the ruling party was “bigger than one man”.“Iniduals come and go. Zanu-PF is the people’s party. We fought for the liberation of this country. We have always had the masses at heart,” Chiwenga told the Observer at a rally in a dusty, desperately poor settlement on the outskirts of Harare.A 61-year-old former general who led the military during the takeover last year, Chiwenga, like Mnangagwa, has been accused of involvement in widespread atrocities perpetrated by security forces in the 1980s.The vice-president promised the small and subdued crowd free healthcare, a metalled road, better schools and sanitation. Zimbabwe’s once-famed infrastructure is crumbling and its economy is shattered. In the dusty shacks behind the neat lines of supporters, life is grim. “Life is horrible. Crime is bad. We have nothing: no school, no clinic, no jobs. They make promises and do nothing, “ said Joy Moyo, 28. “In November, when Mugabe went, we felt good, but so far nothing has been done. I’m very worried for my daughter. What will she have when she grows up?”Such sentiments are widespread, but so is unease about the voluble Chamisa and the ided MDC. “Who knows anything about them? This young man, he talks so much,” said Memory Chila, 45.Previous elections during Mugabe’s rule were marked by systematic violence and intimidation of the opposition, as well as vote-rigging. Though the ruling party has benefited from a biased official media, support of traditional leaders and the manipulation of state handouts, few deny that these polls have been peaceful. Some MDC candidates call the calm “uncanny”.Hundreds of international observers and media have been accredited, in a further break with the past.Ministers deny the government’s desire to hold “free and fair” elections is rooted in anything but a fervent enthusiasm for democracy. Experts point out that whoever rules Zimbabwe will never get the huge loans needed to refloat the economy, attract investors, or satisfy the huge expectations of an increasingly restive population without the goodwill of the international community. This is contingent, as one observer puts it, on an “election that at least meets some basic standards”.The most urgent question now is how the government will react if early indications show the opposition is close to victory on Monday, or if it becomes apparent during the count that Chamisa has won.Some diplomats in Harare believe Mnangagwa will concede gracefully . But few analysts think Zanu-PF or the military will give up power easily.“It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Zanu-PF will be the first liberation party voted out in this region … but it would be surprising. The party would be much happier dealing with the fallout of a flawed victory than defeat,” said Derek Matyszak, an analyst with the South-Africa based Institute for Security Studies. This opens the possibility of a protracted period of instability and protest as all sides appeal for overseas support – and to the streets.Mnangagwa evoked a very different future in his speech on Saturday: a stable, prosperous, secure Zimbabwe ruled by the party that has held power for nearly four decades. “We will all build a united Zimbabwe together. Zanu-PF knows the history of the nation and Zanu-PF is going to continue the destiny of the nation,” he told the crowd in the stadium. But some were already drifting away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84186f6b31184a375e995ecaea283f6ec8ff946d/0_9_1882_1129/master/1882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=856b66c7f66cda682d80422953f3e1e1","title":"cambodian election hun sen vote","story":"Vote set to extend strongman Hun Sen’s more than three decades in power with the only credible opposition dissolved Voting is under way in Cambodia’s general election amid criticism of a crackdown against dissenters by long-serving prime minister Hun Sen, who is set to hold on to power after nearly 33 years in office. The election is the country’s sixth since 1993 when it emerged from decades of war, marked by death and destruction at the hands of Pol Pot’s genocidal regime. Rights groups have denounced the election as a “sham”, following months of intimidation by Hun Sen and the ruling party Cambodian People’s Party and the dissolution last year of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party.Officials manned polling stations in Phnom Penh where 12 parliamentary seats are up for grabs. Hun Sen and his wife Bun Rany arrived early in the morning at a polling station in in Kandal province. Smiling, he greeted voters before casting his ballot and holding up his ink-stained finger as cameras flashed. Nineteen political parties are running against Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party, but none are strongly critical of the government. The opposition CNRP, appealing to younger voters and those seeking change, narrowly lost the last general election in 2013. Authorities arrested CNRP leader Kem Sokha and charged him with treason in September. Two months later, the supreme court dissolved the CNRP, which held 55 seats in Cambodia’s 123-seat National Assembly, after finding it guilty of trying to overthrow the government. Just two days before this election, authorities shut the websites of some independent media. But the government has insisted that the vote will be free and fair.“This election is about the Cambodian people’s will and power,” government spokesman Phay Siphan said in an interview. “People are highly determined to keep peace and stability.” Relations with the West, particularly the United States, are strained, pushing Cambodia closer to China, the single largest investor in Cambodia. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a Cambodia Democracy Act, paving the way for sanctions to be imposed against Hun Sen’s inner circle. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the Cambodian government to guarantee democratic rights. “He calls upon the government to uphold international human rights standards and in particular to ensure guarantees for civil society actors and political parties to exercise their democratic rights,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres.

There were waves in the pools but only for 20 to 30 seconds,” he said, adding that there was no damage to the hotel.The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) reported that in the four hours after the quake, the islands had experienced 66 aftershocks.  BMKG Mataram head Agus Riyanto said the earthquake was also felt in neighboring Bali.The agency said 10 people had died, while 40 were injured. Dozens of buildings have been damaged. In East Lombok, the agency recorded eight fatalities, 10 severely injured and 10 having sustained minor injuries. North Lombok recorded two deaths and 13 injured. The BMKG received a report that the quake had caused a landslide on Mount Rinjani, resulting in the closure of Rinjani’s hiking path. The hike is very popular with western tourists.The epicentre was 130km north-east of the island’s main city of Mataram and was very shallow, which would have amplified its effect. People living near the epicentre felt a strong jolt.“The earthquake was very strong ... and everybody in my house panicked, we all ran outside,” said Zulkifli, a resident of North Lombok, close to the epicentre.“All my neighbours also ran outside and the electricity was suddenly cut off,” he said.Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismic activity hotspot. This earthquake was due to movement in the Flores plate, experts said.It is frequently hit by quakes, most of them harmless. However, the region remains acutely alert to tremors that might trigger tsunamis. In 2004, a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, in western Indonesia, killed 220,000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean, including 168,000 in Indonesia.The latest earthquake was on land and did not trigger any waves or tsunami but authorities issued a yellow alert, suggesting there was a possibility of casualties.A 6.4 magnitude is strong enough to cause injuries and damage to buildings, but largely depends on how densely populated the affected area is. In February, an earthquake of that strength hit Taiwan, killing 17 people and injuring hundreds more. In 2016, 1.248 million Australians visited Indonesia. Bali was the main destination, but Lombok has become increasingly popular.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been contacted about whether there are any reports of of Australian casualties"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f79151913fa52747182acd0beee4761c85666c5/0_85_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50034c7d2fb57b9b96de683121a7d61d","title":"imran khan pakistan election victory analysis","story":"It’s not hard to see why Imran Khan’s stunning victory in the Pakistan elections attracted global media coverage. The story of a cricketing hero and former playboy turned political superstar and scourge of the establishment that spawned him was too good to miss.Given Pakistan’s history of army coups, Khan’s rise to power seemed like a modern parable foretelling the triumph of people’s democracy over the dark-suited, sunglassed forces of “deep state” military control, manipulation and repression.For the British, Pakistan exercises an abiding fascination, rooted in the Raj’s disastrous part in its bloody 1947 birth and in continuing, close ethnic and cultural ties. For the Americans, self-anointed heirs to empire, Pakistan plays the dual role of indispensable ally and duplicitous villain in their endless Afghan drama. For many in India, Islamabad is the nuclear-armed bogeyman next door. For expansionist China, Pakistan is a key link in its grandiose Belt and Road trading franchise, reliant on Beijing’s loans, investment and goodwill.How the untested Khan, wholly lacking in governmental experience, will approach these complex issues and historical burdens is open to question. What is clear is that he has changed radically since his hell-raising West End days. Launching his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, meaning “movement for justice”, in 1996, a newly earnest Khan, now 65, made doing God’s will and fighting corruption his main aims in life.“Far from being the Islamic welfare state that was envisaged, Pakistan is a country where politics is a game of loot and plunder,” Khan wrote in his memoir, Pakistan: A Personal History. His new party, he said, would strive to “end exploitation and ensure a society based on honesty, merit and integrity”.Khan espoused a conservative religious outlook, favouring sharia law and controversially backing radical anti-blasphemy laws. His criticism of US drone strikes earned him the nickname “Taliban Khan”. And he rediscovered his family’s Afghan roots and Pashtun tribal identity. Coincidentally or not, this won him support among conservatives.Likewise, courting populist opinion, Khan turned against Pakistan’s western-educated ruling class, despite graduating from Oxford university. Colonialism had wrought lasting damage across the subcontinent, he wrote, by destroying self-esteem. “The inferiority complex that is ingrained in a conquered nation results in its imitation of some of the worst aspects of the conquerors, while at the same time neglecting its own great traditions.”Twenty years spent clambering up Disraeli’s greasy pole may have mellowed Khan a little, but not entirely. Observers say he remains a passionate, volatile man with authoritarian instincts.But the conciliatory tone of Thursday’s victory speech, in which he called for national unity, surprised and relieved critics. Khan said\u0026nbsphe would seek improved relations with India and Afghanistan, where a nascent peace process is inching forward.He even offered an inquiry into opposition allegations of vote-rigging. Although the row over the “stolen” election will rumble on – minor parties say they plan street protests – Khan’s offer seems to have drawn its sting. The main opposition, the PMLN, has dropped its threat to boycott parliament and accepted defeat. An editorial in Dawn newspaper, headlined “Time to move on”, declared Khan and the PTI had demonstrated “genuine national political appeal”. For that reason, it said, “he ought to be given the political space to try and turn his ideas into reality”.Whether Khan can do so, while maintaining a calm, unifying approach, is now the biggest question in Pakistani politics. Two immediate problems stand out. One is how to prevent the economy imploding under rising debt and devaluation pressures. The other is how the new government can escape the embrace of the overbearing military, which will expect payback for its campaign “assistance”.Pakistan’s generals are accustomed to exercising sole control of foreign and security policy. Challenging them can be a career or even life-ending experience. So if Khan, for example, wants to break with the US, befriend India, or talk to terrorists, he had better watch his back. Whatever the popular storyline says about democracy redux, the hidden hand on the new prime minister’s shoulder is real. It will be hard to shake off."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3579626.1532774459!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may to have extra chance to pitch plans to eu leaders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAustrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May shake hands prior to a meeting in the hotel Sacher in Salzburg, Austria on Friday. Photograph: Kerstin JoenssonAP. British prime minister Theresa May has received a boost after Austria agreed that Brexit would be among the topics for discussion at an informal meeting of EU leaders.Downing Street said Austria’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz had agreed that Britain’s departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country, which currently holds the EU presidency, on September 20th.It means that Ms May has an extra opportunity to discuss Brexit with leaders of the EU 27 and to convince them to support her plan after a week in which ministers have been deployed to various capitals to woo senior politicians.The next meeting will be a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels in October, by which time it is been hoped a final Brexit deal will be hammered out.Ms May was dealt a blow by Brussels on Thursday as its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected the customs proposals that form a key plank of her White Paper.A Downing Street spokesman said: “Following their dinner at Downing Street three weeks earlier, the prime minister and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz had a positive conversation ahead of the Salzburg Festival.“The prime minister updated on the White Paper, and chancellor Kurz confirmed that Brexit would be on the agenda for the informal European Council which Austria would host on September 20th.”Ms May also pitched her deal planning to her Czech and Estonian counterparts, Andrej Babis and Juri Ratas, during talks at the Salzburg Festival. She attended the music event before heading off to Italy for the start of her summer holidays.Ahead of their meeting, Mr Kurz said it was important to “avoid a hard Brexit”.The news came as the head of a pan-European dairy co-operative warned that a no-deal Brexit could send prices soaring and create problems getting products to consumers.Ash Amirahmardi, UK managing director of Arla Foods, spoke after ministers last week raised the spectre of foods and medicines being stockpiled as part of contingency planning in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place on customs.Mr Amirahmardi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that 16 per cent of UK dairy products are imported, and of those 98 per cent were from Europe.  “If we have barriers at our ports then that is what is going to lead to increased prices and potentially supply issues.”He added that World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs, which would come into play if there was no Brexit deal, on dairy products are “penal” and that stockpiling produce is “not something that is really practical for the dairy industry”.He said the average person in the UK consumes the equivalent of three pints of milk per day, adding: “One of the reasons they do is because of the nutritious benefits of it, but it is also accessible in terms of prices.“Any increase in the friction of movement of products will inevitably lead to higher costs and therefore one of our concerns is to make sure consumer prices are accessible post-Brexit.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.UK weather: Strong winds and flood warnings as temperatures plummet after heatwaveWar Horse director Marianne Elliott says lack of female role models made her doubt she would succeedCalls for tighter rules after regulator approves foreign ships dumping palm oil in British waters for three yearsRussian oligarchs are deserting Britain\u0026#39s public schools, as the economic reality of the new Cold War starts to bitePrince Harry to tackle knife crime in next projectBBC to chronicle the \u0026#39life and loves\u0026#39 of Princess Margaret in new documentaryPeer acted as paid adviser to King of Bahrain during the Arab SpringMPs risk damaging public trust by voting to remain anonymous while under investigation, Britain\u0026#39s sleaze watchdog warnsIndonesia earthquake: At least 10 dead as tourist island of Lombok shaken by 6.4-magnitude tremorRail and ferry security checks are a \u0026#39pale shadow\u0026#39 of airport measures, warns influential think tankFor sale: vintage car, one careful owner...the QueenFemale skipper sails into history as youngest to finish world raceSecond backbench MP investigated in bitter row over Labour\u0026#39s new anti-Semitism codeEurotunnel, ferry and plane passengers hit with lengthy delays amid heat and thunderstormsComment: How do we cut illegal immigration?

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. UK weather: Strong winds and flood warnings as temperatures plummet after heatwaveWar Horse director Marianne Elliott says lack of female role models made her doubt she would succeedCalls for tighter rules after regulator approves foreign ships dumping palm oil in British waters for three yearsRussian oligarchs are deserting Britain\u0026#39s public schools, as the economic reality of the new Cold War starts to bitePrince Harry to tackle knife crime in next projectBBC to chronicle the \u0026#39life and loves\u0026#39 of Princess Margaret in new documentaryPeer acted as paid adviser to King of Bahrain during the Arab SpringMPs risk damaging public trust by voting to remain anonymous while under investigation, Britain\u0026#39s sleaze watchdog warnsIndonesia earthquake: At least 10 dead as tourist island of Lombok shaken by 6.4-magnitude tremorRail and ferry security checks are a \u0026#39pale shadow\u0026#39 of airport measures, warns influential think tankFor sale: vintage car, one careful owner...the QueenFemale skipper sails into history as youngest to finish world raceSecond backbench MP investigated in bitter row over Labour\u0026#39s new anti-Semitism codeEurotunnel, ferry and plane passengers hit with lengthy delays amid heat and thunderstormsComment: How do we cut illegal immigration?

Previous dry years mean the water table is low and wells have run dry. The drought has struck 20 provinces, with the worst affected in the north and west.More than 50,000 have already been driven off the land to the city of Herat.Families fleeing the drought last week told the  the crisis was likely to drive more Afghans abroad to seek a better life.The drought comes on top of worsening violence in the country\u0027s long-running conflict and a struggling economy.Large numbers of livestock have died and families have little to eat, while the harvest is expected to fail totally in weeks.One farmer called Ghulam told the  he was facing catastrophe and would consider joining a militant group if it meant his son would not starve.“ I can assure you that some nights, none of these families have even bread to eat, and they go to sleep hungry.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/16/beano-comp.jpg","title":"the beano anniversary characters dc dennis menace minnie minx bash street kids dandy","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Two million kids use The Beano’s website, which is the number of kids who read the comic itself back in the\u0026nbsp1950s.’\u0026nbspDavid Pollock hears an incredible story of resilience and reinvention from that hotbed of rebellion,\u0026nbspDundeeClick to followThe Independent OnlineImagination running wild: Big Eggo the ostrich first appeared in 1938, to be followed by those characters which were to become familiar to generations of avid readers“Whenever we come up to a major anniversary, people always ask us how much longer The Beano can keep going, whether we think we might actually make it to the next birthday,” says Mike Stirling, the title’s editorial director. “But this time things are different – in 2016 we revitalised ourselves with the creation of Beano Studios, and sales of the comic are increasing. I wouldn’t says that makes us cocky, but there’s a certain satisfaction in knowing that no one’s going to be asking the question this time!”He says this with a touch of the impudence of The\u0026nbspBeano’s Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx or one of the Bash Street Kids, a stable of characters who have become intergenerational household names in the UK. Yet if the enthusiasm of the guy in charge echoes the spirit of the comic, this only emphasises one of the key reasons for\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspBeano’s unlikely but very much ongoing success.As well as the embrace of other technologies which Beano Studios was designed to bring about – the free website and app have been hugely successful, and the 2017 animated series Dennis \u0026amp Gnasher: Unleashed! has become CBBC’s top-rated animation, as well as being sold to other countries – it’s the fact the people in charge know and speak to their pre-teen audience so well that keeps readers coming back.Bolstered by this multimedia success, The\u0026nbspBeano’s last set of ABC figures recorded an almost 8 per cent rise it now sells more than 37,500 copies a week, or 1.86 million copies a year. In a comic market which has dropped by approximately 10 per cent in the same period, these figures are somewhere in the region of miraculous, yet simple testimony to publishers DC Thomson’s knowledge of their market. “Online traffic has grown 900 per cent in the last year,” says Stirling. “Two million kids use the site, which is the number of kids who read the comic itself back in the 1950s.”Such new technologies are a world away from what was available in 1938, when the Dundee-based newspaper and publishing company had already enjoyed much success with its line of adventure comics and two recent cartoon creations for the Sunday Post newspaper the still-enduring Broons and Oor Wullie strips. Into this environment of near-guaranteed success, DC Thomson’s head of children’s publishing RD\u0026nbspLow authorised a batch of new titles, including one which featured the adventurous ostrich Big Eggo on its cover.Although many of the characters we most associate with the title hadn’t been developed yet, Stirling says its rebellious tone was baked-in from the beginning. “Dundee was always a rebellious city, in a political sense, and because of all manner of quirks of fate thrown at it. At one point early in the 20th century it was known as She Town, because women ran the city’s jute industry, in which they were very exploited.“They rebelled against this treatment, though. That’s tied up with the 1911 schoolkids’ strike, when children fought for better conditions across the country – this was especially pronounced in Dundee, because they’d seen their mums do the same when they’d been sent on day release from school to work in the jute mills. I don’t think it’s any surprise that some of the generation of kids who were involved in these strikes also went to work for DC Thomson, and were of the same generation who started this rebellious new comic.”It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, that The\u0026nbspBeano as we know it today began to come together, starting with the introduction of creator David Law’s mischievous Dennis the Menace in 1951, and on into Minnie the Minx, Rodger the Dodger, the Bash Street Kids, Beryl the Peril and more. The list of creators working on the title, all of them dead now, is a titanic roll call of Britain’s great humour cartoonists, including Dudley D\u0026nbspWatkins, Leo Baxendale, Ken Reid and more.“Feeling like an underdog or an outsider in some way is a pretty universal feeling, the only weirdos are those who don’t,” says Iain Sawbridge, chief marketing and content officer at Beano Studios, which is based on Fleet Street in London. “The introduction of Dennis in 1951 made The\u0026nbspBeano one of the first brands to really show children behaving like children in popular culture, a version that was anything but the beautifully behaved, seen-but-not-heard simulacra of childhood portrayed in the post-war years.”In Sawbridge’s view, the Beano\u0026nbspsuccess is partly down to the fact that much of the entertainment industry still hasn’t found a way of replicating what The\u0026nbspBeano got right more than 60 years ago. “The reality is, the media industry doesn’t ‘think kid’ enough” he says. “So children aren’t always getting the entertainment experiences they deserve in broadcast or digital environments, and the digital world where older kids now spend most of their time isn’t made for 6 to 12s.“Gaming, YouTube and social media are largely designed for 13 and over, and yet children now spend more time online than on television. Why aren’t there more places made for them, with content they love and environments that are safe? That’s why we created beano and our YouTube channel, to complement The\u0026nbspBeano comic.”What made The\u0026nbspBeano stand out at the beginning as the most exciting entertainment product available to children, says Stirling, is what has kept it alive even after its stablemate the Dandy – launched in 1937 – has gone (although the hardback Dandy annual is still a bestseller). “The\u0026nbspBeano was the first comic to have all kids as their main core of characters, and this core has lasted until today,” he says.The mantra of the title these days, and its digital offshoot, is to be “So Beano”. “It’s about looking on the bright side of life, trying to find a laugh in every situation, offering something cool that kids can talk about in the playground,” says Stirling. “We’ve distilled all the principles of the comic and applied them online. We look at the world from a perspective of what we call ‘four-foot thinking’, a kid’s-eye view, at the absurdity in situations, and the injustice in them. Kids are very honest about how they observe things, they can see the emperor has no clothes.”Sawbridge points out that audience research via school visits, and readers’ emails and responses, as well as interaction with a group of designated young “Trendspotters” around the country, is part of what drives content on the site – which blends strips with videos and more bitesize, online native content – and in the comic. Beano researchers have spent 600 hours face to face with children in the last 12 months, he says, which is only a more advanced way of doing what the title’s early creators did the Bash Street Kids came about because DC Thomson’s offices overlooked the yard of the local school, and the creators noticed how the kids interacted before feeding this into the strip.This interaction, he says, has brought about a new character for the 80th-anniversary edition named Mandi. “She was co-created between us and one of our partners, the mental health charity Young Minds, deliberately to address the everyday issues experienced by kids today which can cause stresses or anxieties that can affect mental health. Whenever she appears she will be experiencing some of these issues for instance, in her first appearance she’s getting her first mobile phone, and the good and bad that come with that, which is something a lot of kids will be experiencing this summer.”After the anniversary issue – which is guest-edited by David Walliams – appears this week, there are plenty of other plans in the works, including a return for the Dennis and Gnasher Fan Club, a forthcoming live-action Minnie the Minx series aimed at young teens, and further plans to bring characters like Bananaman to the screen. It’s all about simply keeping with the times.“It’s school holidays and we’ve had this incredible weather, so we’ve found that more kids have been playing outside over summer,” says Stirling. “They’re returning to what we might call ‘traditional play patterns’ – but kids don’t lose these, they always have them, they just reinvent them for themselves. I think as a parent it’s sometimes difficult to accept this, you have this misty-eyed view of what you did or didn’t do as a child, but kids of different generations all essentially want the same things. Part of that is taking a bit of time and attention, and we want to present Beano as a friend to them, so parents know that they can trust it as a safe place for their kids to go online.“You know, we tell kids to grow up, or we say pejoratively to people ‘you’re acting like a five-year-old’,” he continues. “But why not? It’s a brilliant time in your life, you’re free-thinking, you’ve got a wild imagination, you’ve got no limits and very few rules. Them we get into a system when we’re given a list of things we can’t do, but I think we need to try and retain an element of how we thought when we were six or seven.“Keep that optimism, keep that hope, and you’ll feel happier throughout your life. People might say that’s naivete, but once again it comes back to how children can spot that the emperor’s new clothes are fake. They have a way of thinking which is pure.”The Beano’s 80th anniversary on Monday 30 July will be celebrated by a special birthday edition guest-edited by David Walliams. Celebratory exhibitions around the country include ‘Beano: A Manual for Mischief’ at V\u0026ampA, London, until 12\u0026nbspAugust, and ‘Bash Street’s Back at the McMenace!’ at the McManus Gallery, Dundee, until 21\u0026nbspOctoberbeano at 80Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

rainfall over the last few weeks combined with record breaking temperatures is having a dramatic effect on the normally green rural landscapeMichael Gove\u0026nbspis to summon\u0026nbspwater company chief executives to explain why they have failed to meet leakage targets\u0026nbspas the country struggles to cope with the dry summer.The environment\u0026nbspsecretary said customers expect a reliable and resilient water supply following reports of low levels in some reservoirs and the introduction by North West supplier United Utilities of a hosepipe ban from August 5.It comes as farmers were also due to meet with Government officials for a drought summit to discuss the effect of the heatwave on the country\u0027s food supplies.Water company shareholders collect £6.5bn in idends and interestWater industry must fix its leaky performanceEnglish homes face loss of water supply \u0027because of drought\u0027The first half of the summer in the UK has been the driest since 1961 with Friday\u0027s wet weather and storms the first rainfall in weeks.United Utilities has been accused of wasting 430 million litres of water every day from leakages but claims that reducing leaks is a top priority.The\u0026nbspGMB\u0026nbspunion said earlier this month that its research showed that the firm was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u0027 worth of water to go down the plughole every day.Mr Gove said that water\u0026nbspcompanies have much more to do to tackle leakage, adding: That is why I have repeatedly made clear that companies must improve and recently wrote to them to outline my expectations during this period of dry weather.Next week I will ask the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to a meeting at Defra to discuss how they are going to address this serious issue and improve their performance.Irrigation water shortages, a lack of fresh forage for animals and growing conditions for cereal crops are among issues that will be discussed at separate talks chaired by National Farmers\u0027 Union president Minette Batters.She will sit down on Wednesday with officials from Defra and rural agencies after a July that has seen England receive just 15 per cent\u0026nbspof its long-term average rainfall.Ms Batters described the situation as hugely challenging for all sectors of farming, warning that the thunderstorms and showers some areas are receiving won\u0027t mitigate the many issues farmers are experiencing.There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests, she said.This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It\u0027s a timely reminder that we shouldn\u0027t take food production for granted.Farming is one of the most affected industries when it comes to managing volatility.Those due to attend the summit alongside Defra include the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and farming charities RABI and Farming Community Network, the NFU said.Last week the Environment Agency said it had responded to 44 significant environmental incidents since the end of June, including moorland fires, algal blooms, dry boreholes, low river flows and fish rescues.Historic sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales Crop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales The last month of dry, hot weather followed the driest June since 1925, the Environment Agency said. It has seen the water level in many reservoirs fall dramatically.While only one water company is currently planning a hosepipe ban, continued dry weather into the autumn could see a risk of further restrictions and impacts on the environment, the National Drought Group said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6406121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg","title":"brexit referendum final say petition vote eu remain leave theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.Politicians backing campaign say British people deserve right to have say on final terms of dealClick to followIndy PoliticsFinal Say: More than 340,000 people back The Independent\u0027s campaign for a vote on government\u0027s Brexit dealHave you backed our campaign?

This vote must include an option for an exit from Brexit.Vote Leave chief leaks \u0027fake news\u0027 report on misuse of dataOdds on second referendum and no-deal Brexit tumbleThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“I congratulate The Independent for joining this campaign. It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines. It should be your #Finalsay.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Have you backed our campaign? Click here to sign our petition.Regardless of how you voted in the Brexit referendum, you deserve a say on the final deal.That’s why we’re launching the Final Say campaign, to win for the British people the right to make that all-important decision on the Brexit deal. Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns – again, on both sides – were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.A full account of The Independent’s view is available here.In 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it’s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal – before it’s too late.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/18/theresa-may-final-say-3.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/18/theresa-may-final-say-3.jpg","title":"final say brexit latest young voters second referendum remain poll","story":"Created with Sketch.Pro-EU\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsphave questioned whether this demographic shift could \u0027tip the scales\u0027\u0026nbspin a fresh pollClick to followIndy PoliticsFinal Say: More than 1.4m additional young people could vote in new Brexit referendumMore than 1.4 million young people would be eligible to vote in a fresh\u0026nbspreferendum compared with\u0026nbspthe 2016 Brexit poll, raising questions about the potential impact of this new\u0026nbspcohort of voters.Analysis of the census data shows the group\u0026nbspwho have come of age since the EU referendum now outnumbers the Leave side’s 1.26 million majority over Remain.Pro-EU MPs\u0026nbsphave questioned whether this demographic shift could “tip the scales”\u0026nbspin a fresh poll amid growing speculation over the possibility that Theresa May’s plans could lead to Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.It comes after\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplaunched its Final Say campaign for the electorate to have a vote on the prime minister’s Brexit deal, which gained more than 300,000 signatures in the first 48 hours.Pollsters generally agree that between 70 and 75 per cent of under-25s voted to stay in the EU in 2016. YouGov places the figure at 71 per cent, while former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft puts it at 73 per cent.Recent polling also shows that\u0026nbsp70 per cent of undergraduates think they would be worse off after Brexit, while 67 per cent\u0026nbspwould support another vote.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable\u0026nbspsaid: “The referendum two years ago was influenced by the Conservatives’ resistance to open up the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds.

It is more of a 5050 chance.He added: “If you are going to get a second referendum, it is going to be because the government has lost control of the House of Commons – or after a general election.“It would be more likely if Labour changes its position or if the government decides it needs it to get out of jail.\u0026nbspThat is the only way the Brexiteers and the Anna Soubrys of this world would be able to agree.”A string of senior politicians have backed the Final Say campaign, including former prime minister Tony Blair, former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg and prominent\u0026nbspConservative MPs Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve.Labour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna and Ms Moran, the Lib Dem education spokesman,\u0026nbsphave also lent their support.It comes as Ms May’s attempts efforts to bypass Brussels and deal directly with European nations\u0026nbspfloundered, as Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, poured cold water on a key part of the prime minister’s Brexit plans.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/26/15/rtx3pq99.jpg","title":"steve bannon movement ukip brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.Party pledges\u0026nbspto share experience with the new groupClick to followIndy PoliticsFormer White House chief strategist is setting up a group to boost the fortunes of the European far rightUkip has pledged to work with\u0026nbspSteve Bannon’s new European alt-right movement, forging what critics have branded an “unholy alliance” to bring down the EU and fuel populism across the continent.Mr Bannon, a former investment banker who founded the website Breitbart, has pledged to bolster the continent’s far right with a new foundation called The Movement that would dole out resources to eurosceptics and anti-EU populists.The former chief strategist of Donald Trump has rattled Brussels after stating his intention to\u0026nbspcreate a “supergroup” in the European parliament after next’s year’s EU elections, with extreme right-wingers taking as many as a third of the legislature’s seats.Though Ukip MEPs will not be able to participate directly in the parliament because of Brexit, a spokesperson pledged that the party would share experience with Mr Bannon’s project to give it a leg up, stating they expected the group to have a “large impact” on European politics and hoped for “a new army of eurosceptic MEPs”.Mr Bannon’s move into Europe also appears set to have an impact on the dynamics of Brexit talks, with one source close to Brexit negotiations telling The Independent that Brussels has been spooked by the alt-right project.As a result, EU officials are increasingly resistant to calls for the Article 50 negotiating period to be extended, so as to avoid eurosceptic Britain participating in the European parliament elections scheduled for next May.The EU is said to fear that such an outcome would see Ukip, which won the 2014 European elections in the UK, return to the parliament and bolster the numbers of Mr Bannon’s new anti-EU group.Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel“They really don’t want to see Farage back with Bannon for the sake of a few extra weeks,” one source close to talks said.Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign told The Independent the British eurosceptic party were “desperately trying to make themselves relevant again” by joining forces with Mr Bannon.“Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel,” she said.“Having been forgotten over the last two years, Ukip are desperately trying to make themselves relevant again. But they’ve got their work cut out for them: nobody wants to hear the verbal sewage coming out of a group whose only claim to fame is their rent-a-gob ex-leader.“Now they want dark elements of the far right in America to help plot their nasty agenda. The dangers stirred up by this kind of right-wing populism are obvious, but terrifying for the many people who fear history might be repeating itself.”A spokesperson for Ukip’s EFDD group told The Independent: “Steve Bannon certainly seems to offer a different perspective, and with his experience of American politics he could exert a large impact on the European scene which is currently going through quite a change.“Ukip MEPs wish to leave the EU in March 2019 and have no desire to return to its facade of democracy in Brussels. The MEPs will however be happy to share their experience with a new army of eurosceptic MEPs from a liberated UK.”Far-right, eurosceptic\u0026nbspand right-wing populist parties are currently scattered across a wide range of groups in the European parliament, including the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) – as well as parties with no group.\u0026nbspSuch parties are expected to make gains at EU level next year, as they have done in national elections since the last European parliament contest. Finding agreement between them to join a single group could be difficult, however, with many parties extremely cautious of their domestic image and loathe to ally with foreign parties that are seen as more extreme at home.\u0026nbspSome of the parties might turn their noses up at uniting under the leadership of an American organisation, too, as many have an anti-American political outlook.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/26/09/Israel-Gaza-airstrike.jpg","title":"gaza israel conflict what happening palestinian idf border jerusalem west bank","story":"Created with Sketch.United Nations has urged both sides to \u0027step back from the brink of war\u0027\u0026nbsp– your questions answered about latest flare-up in violence\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineA fireball exploding in Gaza City during Israeli bombardment on July 20  Q. Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Both have argued against strengthening the Palestinians’ international political clout until a peace settlement\u0026nbspis reached in the intractable Arab-Israeli conflict which agrees on the formation of an independent Palestinian state.\u0026nbspThe permanent Palestinian observer to the UN, Riyad Mansour, confirmed news of the Group 77 decision in a phone interview on Tuesday with The New York Times.\u0026nbspThe Palestinian mission to the UN was granted observer status in 2012, which made it eligible to join important bodies such as the International Criminal Court and Unesco.The Palestinians have used their membership of both agencies to further their push for statehood as well as file complaints about alleged Israeli human rights abuses\u0026nbspand settlement expansion in the West Bank.\u0026nbspPalestinian protesters clash with Israeli troops: in picturesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesThe move to give the Palestinians the chair of such a large delegation comes at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, sparked by the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, and a new, significant stumbling block in the peace process in the form of US president Donald Trump\u0027s\u0026nbspadministration.\u0026nbspMr Trump’s decision to fulfil an election campaign promise last December by recognising the contested city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked protests across the Muslim world.\u0026nbspIt also led the Palestinian Authority leadership to sever diplomatic relations with the US, declaring the White House could no longer be an “honest broker” between the two parties.\u0026nbspThe stalled negotiations do not sit well with Donald Trump, who has made Arab-Israeli peace – which he describes as “the ultimate deal” – a foreign policy priority.\u0026nbspIn an effort to force the Palestinians to the table, at the beginning of the year the US cut $65m\u0026nbsp(£49m) of an earmarked $125m\u0026nbspin funding to the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Unrwa.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You should see a picture of the council house where I started out.The self-made billionaire added: Look, these are extremely big numbers, but Im 65 and Ive been doing this for 25 years. With exception of 2008, weve been successful every year.So you kind of get used to it.Ratcliffe was knighted in the Queens Birthday Honours list on June 2, 2018.He received the honour for services to business and investment.The billionaire has approached Roman Abramovich to buy Chelsea Football Club.But his advances are understood to have been rejected by the Russian oligarch.However, in July fresh reports emerged linking him with a takeover of the club.The Secret Footballer Twitter account claimed that Jim Ratcliffe is closing in on purchasing the Blues for £2billion.Sources close to Chelsea though were quick to rule out any sale.Jim Ratcliffe divorced ex-wife Amanda Townson in 1995 after a ten-year marriage.They had two sons and Ratcliffe also has one daughter with his second wife, Alicia.He lives in Chelsea and Hampshire and, in May 2017, submitted his fifth plan to build a luxury home at Thorns Beach, near Beaulieu - to replace an existing two-bedroom bungalow. Ratcliffe is reported to have completed the 2007 London Marathon and is a keen skier.He has owned two superyachts, and in 2012 he took delivery of the 78-metre Hampshire II, which he still owns.A keen adventurer, Ratcliffe has made expeditions to the North and South Poles as well as a three-month-long motorbike trek in South Africa."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422824175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the met office can stick advice where sun doesnt shine let us enjoy the heat while it lasts","story":"You get a lovely chill from the cotton. OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what sort of relationship do they want with us after all this is over?Talking about, and planning for, no-deal is not the “bravado” sneered at by Simon Coveney, deputy to pipsqueak PM Leo Varadkar. It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day. Especially on days when Irish politicians are wheeled on to pressurise us to shift even further towards Brussels’ fixed position.We have compromised far too much already. The EU must now cross some red lines. Why not? No country has left before. The situation is unprecedented. The EU’s response must be too.Ireland will be hit hard if no deal is struck.It should be pleading with Brussels. It can see Theresa May has no ­further room for manoeuvre without her Government imploding.And no, Mr Coveney, Britain doesn’t need “more time”.We need the EU to finally accept we aren’t changing our minds — unlike ­Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty and despite the Remainer clamour to do so.That way lies permanent servitude, global humiliation and political chaos.HOW can anyone guarantee a convicted paedophile or rapist is safe enough to be taken off the sex offenders’ register?The number of criminals winning that right since a law change six years ago is 1,230, including 632 child abusers.They no longer report to police or tell them if they are away from home.Even some put on the database “for life” can apply after 15 years to be removed. A thriving legal industry helps them do it.Decisions are simply at cops’ discretion. But how stringent are their tests when approval rates vary so wildly?We know “life” sentences in prison mean nothing. Now we cannot even trust “life on the sex offenders’ register”.Public safety must always come before the rights of potentially dangerous perverts.SOMETIMES we despair at our cops.They couldn’t be bothered looking into shoplifting at John Keppie’s sweet store. But they snapped into action with a warning over “data protection” when he put up CCTV pictures of the suspects.What is he meant to do? How does he prevent losses from thieving teenagers without a functioning police force?The local “Reducing Crime Partnership” even attacked John’s posters as like “returning to the Wild West”.It’s already a Wild West.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will not allow Britain to enjoy frictionless trade as a non-member. So what happens next?EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier wants us to stay in the customs union, ending our freedom to strike global trade deals. But Mrs May would not survive breaching her own red line on this.Going back on her word would spark more Brexit ministers resigning from Government, making her position untenable. So what then?If Barnier and the sozzled Jean-Claude Juncker don’t like our proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice.No-deal is the only logical next step.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insists that we will be prepared for Brexit “come what may”. Good.We don’t want a hard border in Ireland. Nor do the Irish. But if the EU won’t budge, it may be unavoidable.Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s cosying up to Brussels and his anti-Brexit sabre-rattling is grossly misplaced.His country will be hit badly in the event of a no-deal.Let’s see how the Irish like that.THE Sun warned that the privacy ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard case would have a chilling impact on Press freedom and harm the pursuit of justice.Mr Justice Mann set a very dangerous precedent by suggesting those under police investigation should not be named in normal circumstances.Surprise, surprise! It took a week for us to get a legal letter citing the case to try to prevent publication of a story.A union official has been suspended for allegedly pleasuring themselves in their office and in public and uploading pictures of their activity online.The lawyers objected to us revealing the official’s name because they claimed an internal investigation was “private”.The judge’s ruling is a dangerous slide towards Press censorship, at the expense of YOUR right to know.Of course, the winners are the rich and powerful who can afford top lawyers to stop any scrutiny, regardless of the public interest.This terrible judgment must be appealed – and quickly.BRITS love to moan about the weather – usually about how wet and cold it is.But this week the complaints have been that it is too hot.

This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally it doesnt offend me.I do understand and respect peoples point of view that it is offensive. But its not my right to tell a shop they cant sell something.Kirstin Maycock, who manages the charity shop, said: We would never wish to cause offence when selling a donated item.Our team are always reluctant to commit to the rubbish bin items that are in good condition. However on this occasion the donation should not have been put out for sale and has now been removed from the shop floor and will not be sold.We would like to take this opportunity of thanking our community for their continued support.

Heres Hernandezs story.Born in 1896 near Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon in north-east Mexico, Hernandez was introduced to academia at an early age thanks to her father, who was a professor.She stayed in Monterrey and worked as an elementary teacher before marrying Pedro Hernandez Barrera at the age of 19 in Texas.After their marriage they moved to San Antonio and started a family, eventually having 10 children.Their large brood allowed them to run a family-owned grocery store and bakery.At the time life for Mexican Americans or immigrants in parts of the US was one of segregation and racial oppression.Hernandez and her husband fought against this and the poor education children would receive in comparison to American children.As a result, Hernandez and Barrera created the Order of the Knights of America - a committee which fought to improve the lives of Mexican families in the US.Her many achievements include being the first Mexican woman to work as an announcer on the radio in 1932 and meeting Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas in 1939 following her support for a group of women who had gone on strike to fight for better working conditions.While her name became more and more prominent, Hernandez went on to become a regular on Texas television where she would continue her battle for greater civil rights for her countrymen and women.At the age of 89, she died from pneumonia in 1986 and was buried in Elmendorf, Texas.Explaining its decision to pay tribute to her, Google said: Today’s Doodle illustrates Hernández doing what she did best – using her voice to elevate and benefit her community.In 1998, the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second o of Google as a message to that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.In that same year, a turkey was added to Thanksgiving and two pumpkins appeared as the os for Halloween the following year.Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.Among the Doodles published in past months were designs commemorating German scientist Robert Koch, Jan Ingenhousz (who discovered photosynthesis) and the 50th anniversary of kids coding languages being introduced.And the search giant celebrated the 2017 Autumn Equinox , which marked the official ending of summer and the coming of autumn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a private event in his constituency which had nothing to do with his role as Minister for Housing.“I put it on his diary card to be helpful though it really wasn’t my res­p­onsibility to sort things like that. Next day he was raging. He had called my line manager in a fit at 10pm. He was furious — he couldn’t find the address.“The door number was wrong, everything was a mess and he had hit the roof about his diary management. My line manager, his private secretary, knew the error had been made by another PA and it wasn’t my fault.“We tried to explain but he had no time to listen. He said, ‘I don’t care. There is an issue with diary management in this office’. I was made to feel small and undervalued. He seemed to be avoiding talking to me which created an awkward dynamic.“He had some kind of personal issue with me. In the end the other PA admitted it was her error. Even then, there was not a single apology or acceptance he made me doubt my capabilities and my place in that office. I felt bullied. I was distraught. I felt wrecked by the way he made me feel.“His inability to accept when he is wrong is a nasty characteristic. It’s typical Dominic Raab behaviour.”Rebecca said she was not the only one in the office treated cruelly by Mr Raab, who replaced David Davis as Brexit Secretary on the same day she was given her P45.She said: “There were days he would call other staff and scream at them down the phone. It reduced one of my colleagues to tears. He called her later to say, ‘Sorry, I was overworked and over-stressed’.“If he didn’t like the format of a briefing, he would just say, ‘I’m not going to read it’. I felt it was impossible to work with him. The way he spoke to others was short and sharp. He’d cut people off.”Rebecca’s claims are not the first time the Esher and Walton MP has faced a storm over his attitude.In 2011, he branded some feminists “obnoxious bigots”, claiming men were getting such a “raw deal” that it was time they “started burning their briefs”. His remarks put him at loggerheads with Prime Minister Theresa May.Rebecca went on: “He was notorious for going to the gym every day for one hour and 15 minutes. I had to fit that in no matter what. There were times when it was just not workable and I’d say, ‘I’m really sorry, I’ve had to cut five minutes off the gym because you have a really important meeting.“His reaction would be, ‘No, you don’t have authority over the diary. You ask me first and then I make that change’. I found it patronising. His responses were just rude.“His tone was aggressive. You’d be mid-sentence and he’d say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to hear from you’. Whatever your status, there is no need to be like that with anyone.”Dad-of-two Mr Raab also sometimes refused to walk to the Commons from his office.Rebecca said: “It was just a seven-minute walk, but he requested the daily use of the ministerial car.”She claims there were ­simmering tensions with the staff of other ministers in the department. She said: “If I asked Dominic to take on a commitment that others couldn’t, he’d say, ‘They all seem to think this is one big happy family. It’s not. It’s me and it’s them’. He was referring to the other junior ministers. That remark stands out.”Rebecca was suspended in April after a newspaper sting revealed she had met men via the sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement. At the time Mr Raab went on radio to dismiss the scandal as a “storm in a teacup”.Then Rebecca was dismissed for breaches of conduct — a humiliating end to a career which began when she joined the civil service at 16.Rebecca is now setting off on a round-the-world voyage. She said: “I’m excited for a new beginning. This chapter in my life has closed, and I’m ready for the next.”A source close to Mr Raab said last night: “Rebecca was dismissed according to an independent process. This is an attempt to cash in by smearing with false and malicious claims.”Rishi Sunak, who worked with Mr Raab as a junior housing minister, said: “Dom was a great colleague, supportive and collegiate. I have tremendous respect for him.”A Housing Ministry spokesman said: “We do not recognise these claims and they do not reflect the department’s experience — including those who worked directly with the minister in his private office.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was an extremely arrogant young man. The fact that he was not wearing a life jacket sums him up. He thought he was better than everyone else.“This has been his comeuppance resulting in the tragic, tragic loss of the life of a young lady. I send my condolences to Charlotte’s family.”He told how Shepherd had “a campaign of plugging in an electrical outlet and tripping all the electrics” in the school which he did not want named.He said: “For about six months we had electricians in trying to diagnose the fault and we could never get to the bottom of it until he was found with this device he had constructed to cause this chaos, and it did cause a lot of problems.“We reflect on students and I have discussed this with others, he had this arrogance about him and we felt at some point something bad would happen and tragically this is what it resulted in.“Despite everyone’s best efforts at the school to try, we weren’t able to help him behave with a bit more sensibility and turn his life around.”Web designer Shepherd, originally from Exeter, wed his childhood sweetheart after the tragedy and now has a two-year-old child.The couple have since split and he has been on the run since March and has not even spoken to his mum.He was blasted for his “cowardice” for failing to face justice at the Old Bailey.Charlotte, 24, was thrown into the river after she and Shepherd took his boat out onto the water during a first date in December 2015 after a champagne dinner at The Shard.He had been trying to impress her and didn’t even ask if she could swim. His date could be heard screaming “you’re going so fast” in her mobile phone video before the crash.Tragedy struck when she took the wheel and the boat hit a log and capsized - catapulting the pair into the freezing water.

The changes – which will be announced today following an eight-week consultation — will give “clear and consistent” guidelines and stop a potential boom of bogus claims for badges.Under the new rules, the badge will be extended to people who cannot undertake a journey without there being a risk of serious harm to their health or safety or that of any other person, such as young kids with autism.Others who will become eligible include those who cannot make a journey without suffering considerable psychological distress or have considerable difficulty walking.Minister for disabled people Sarah Newton said: “It is absolutely right that disabled people are able to go about their daily life without worrying how they will get from one place to another.“We’re taking an important step forward in ensuring people with hidden disabilities get the support they need to live independently.”National Autistic Society boss Jane Harris said the move would make a massive difference to the lives of many people.She said: “Just leaving the house is a challenge for many…involving overwhelming anxiety about plans going wrong.“The possibility of not being able to find a parking space near where you’re going can mean you can’t contemplate leaving the house at all.

There are 3,011 houses with seven youngsters – costing £27million – and 9,230 with six at cost to the public purse of £73 million.The handouts are used by the family to pay the rent on properties big enough to house their huge families – often running up massive rent bills. The average monthly payout in housing benefit to these families with ten or more children is now £744-per-month, which is more than many working families pay on their mortgages.The numbers of the jumbo-sized families with ten or more kids needing housing benefit has climbed in recent years, our Freedom of Information investigation showed. In 2013 the number was 188 and in 2014 it had reached 205.

It was full of other young people and they didn\u0027t look like me. They all looked unhappy, just different, and I couldn\u0027t understand why I was there.I entered the room and the doctor diagnosed me with anorexia. I couldn\u0027t understand it: anorexics, I thought, were skinny and I certainly wasn\u0027t.I accused him of lying and told him to stop making me fat. I wasn\u0027t anorexic. Over the next few months things got harder. I felt completely trapped and gradually more out of control.My days were spent obsessively exercising, skipping as many meals as possible and either ending the day with a massive family row or eating dinner really quickly then heading upstairs to make myself sick.I used to sit in my therapy sessions being told that my body was falling apart and I was losing the fat round my organs. But I didn\u0027t believe anyone telling me this. I thought they were just jealous I had a best friend who made me feel so good.It spiralled out of control so fast that months after my first appointment at child and adolescent mental health services my heart nearly stopped and I was admitted to a mental health hospital where I spent the next year of my life recovering.It was the hardest year of my life: revisiting past experiences, learning to talk about my feelings and learning to accept that I needed help.After that year in hospital, I had developed a handbook of coping mechanisms - including learning to talk about how I felt, challenging myself around food, and getting rid of all emotions.But my biggest frustration was that people still thought your anorexia must be completely gone if you were a healthy weight.That is not the reality. There is so much more to recovery than gaining physical weight.Recovery isn\u0027t always a straight line either. You have to learn what triggers to watch out for, and to be aware if it gets tough again.As we entered in to 2016 I was feeling positive about life. I barely thought about my anorexia and I certainly didn\u0027t let her dictate what I did.But after my grandma passed away, anorexia used it as a reason to seduce me. She pulled me in when I was feeling weak and grieving, sucking me closer and closer. After four months of battling with this relentless voice in my head I reached out for help. I got an appointment at my local mental health trust, but because I wasn\u0027t underweight there was nothing they could do for me.My story isn\u0027t unique. In fact there are countless people who get turned away for not being \"thin\" enough, or not fitting a specific criteria. It isn\u0027t right or fair that this is still happening - and it means people with eating disorders aren\u0027t getting the treatment they need to prevent them getting worse.After I came through my relapse I decided that I needed to help others, so I wrote a book, Stand Tall Little Girl, and I began doing talks about mental health."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-hope-virgo-weight_4374563.jpg?20180729012114 ","title":"not thin enough for help gps turn away anorexics for being a healthy weight","story":"The experience led her to start a petition called Dump The Scales, which calls for GPs and medical practitioners to take a new approach when dealing with patients who have eating disorders.Current guidelines, set by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), are clear.Doctors are told not to use measures such as a patient\u0027s body mass index (BMI) or how long they have been ill to determine whether or not to offer treatment, and to ensure they are given help at the earliest opportunity.However, Ms Virgo claims these rules are not being applied everywhere.She said: \"I don\u0027t want to rewrite the whole of the guidelines.

Days before we spotted the sprinkler at Teddington Lock, in South-west London, the quango told the public: “We encourage everyone to use water wisely. “Avoid using sprinklers and don’t water your lawn.

Imre Marton, 33, is so scared he lives like a recluse. He covers the windows of his home with film and thick black \u0026shycurtains so no one can see in. And his ordeal goes on despite his tormentor Charlie Howells being behind bars for a second time because she has \u0026shysuggested she has accomplices ready to help her and his “days are numbered”. Imre said: “I never feel safe. I know she won’t stop and this is never going to end. I am living in fear, always looking over my shoulder. I am sure that one day she will kill me. It’s the end goal for her. Her mission is for us to die together,” Imre’s nightmare began in 2012 when Howells, 24, first boarded his No32 bus in Oxfordshire. She began memorising his schedules. Her bizarre \u0026shybehaviour \u0026shyincluded standing just inches behind him so she could sniff him.  After she declared her love for Imre and he rejected her, Howells began \u0026shybombarding him with thousands of \u0026shymessages – \u0026shysometimes up to 500 a day. They included proposals, suggesting they tie the knot on a bus, and claims she had found his home address. Imre reported her and after four years of \u0026shytorment she got two years in May 2016. He spoke to the Sunday People after the case and in November 2017 took part in BBC documentary My Stalker and Me to help raise awareness of the issue. But his appearance re-ignited Howells’s campaign and she messaged him on Facebook to say: “You are the biggest fool ever, going on TV saying you wear a stab vest.  Well now Charlie knows where not to stab you… You thought your life was in danger then, there are many people out to get you now. I’d watch my back if I was you, you have been warned!!!!” Earlier this month Howells was jailed again for three years at Oxford crown court and given a ten-year restraining order. Imre, who left the city in January but is too scared to say where he is, said: “I take no comfort in her getting three years. “It just gives her more time to plan what she is going to do next – and that terrifies me.” Recalling how the campaign started, he said: “I’d feel her breath on me. She was like a ninja, she would \u0026shyappear from nowhere. She was always there.” After his rejection, Howells began turning up in shops and cafes Imre was visiting. On the bus she played One Direction songs and handed him notes.  Police gave Howells a \u0026shywarning but she found Imre on Facebook. He was forced to delete his account and apply for a transfer out of the city centre. Howells found him again and in August 2014 he won a two-year \u0026shyrestraining order – \u0026shybanning her from the city, his route and any contact. She ignored it. Imre said: “To avoid her, I cut my bus shifts and began working as a bouncer but she found me, getting my number from a driver who didn’t know how dangerous she was. She called every minute of the day.” Imre called 101 or 999 every time but her stalking campaign escalated. In 2015 Howells first said she was going to kill him – running a finger across her throat as she made the threat. Terrifingly, in April that year, Imre was with a colleague when Howells threw water in his face which he feared was acid. He said: “I felt lucky it was only water but it made me realise how easy it was for her to harm me.” In August, with Howells screaming “like an animal” at him, he called police again. She was remanded in custody and Imre secured a two-year restraining order. Howells was then twice convicted of breaching her restraining order and jailed in June 2015 for eight weeks. After persistently ignoring the order, she got two years in May 2016. The order was extended to five years.  But even with Howells behind bars, Imre was not safe. The first message he got was from a “friend” of hers, who Imre believes was a fake account. She continued to declare her love for him when she was released in August last year. Despite Imre blocking Howells, she kept creating new accounts. After he \u0026shyappeared in the documentary, her messages took an even more sinister turn. Chillingly, Howells told Imre: “If I can’t have you, no one else will.” She also told him on the bus and in the street that they were “going to die together”. The stalking escalated and in January Howells, of Shrivenham, Oxon, was held again after turning up at a bus stop and shouting and screaming at him. Police found she had a blade. Imre said: “I felt scared. I was told she was saying she is going to stab me in the neck and she had a knife.” He took a lower-paid job, which he does not wish to reveal, and left Oxford. He did not go to court on July 5 to see her locked up again. Imre said: “Even though she is behind bars again, I am still in constant fear. Everywhere I look, I think of her. She’s ruined my life.” Howells got three years after admitting breaching a restraining order, intimidating a witness and possessing a bladed article. But Imre said the term “is not long enough” and his own life is now more like serving a sentence.

As the three-year-old poses on his \u0026shyloving adopted mum’s lap, few would realise the hell he has endured. Tony was just six weeks old when his parents violently swung him around by the legs, causing eight fractures. He was injured so badly that he had to have a double amputation.  But mum Jody Simpson and dad Tony Smith were only brought to \u0026shyjustice because of the determination of his adoptive mum Paula Hudgell. And Paula is still fighting for justice after Simpson, 24, and Smith, 47, were convicted of child cruelty and jailed for ten years. Paula, 50, is campaigning for \u0026shytougher sentences for child neglect and abuse. And she has spoken out after Simpson made a bid to be freed early from jail. She said: “Jody left her son close to death and now she wants sympathy. She can’t accept her guilt for what she did to her own child. “By appealing to have her sentence reduced shows she has no remorse.” She added: “Both his parents \u0026shydeserve to rot in prison.” Tony was just 41 days old when he was admitted to hospital with multiple organ failure, numerous \u0026shyfractures and sepsis.  By four months, he still weighed only 9lb 7oz but he was ready to be \u0026shydischarged into the arms of foster\u0026shy \u0026shycarers Paula and Mark, 53 – who have seven kids of their own. Paula first met Tony in February 2015. She said: “Tony was on the brink of death. My heart broke.” Tony’s body had inflated like a \u0026shyballoon fighting infections from thigh bone, lower leg, ankle, thumb, and toe fractures. Doctors said he may never be able to sit up or crawl and may face development delays from the amount of life-saving drugs he received. Paula knew little about Tony’s \u0026shybackground but alarm bells rang after meeting his birth parents, who told her the injuries had been a “terrible accident”. Paula and asset manager Mark took Tony home in Kings Hill, Kent, to meet their children Ben, 28, Chloe, 23, Ryan, 26, Kyle, 16, Jessica, 11, Jaden, ten, and Lacey, five.  Paula, a former market researcher, said: “I didn’t think too much about his parents – we were all just getting to grips with Tony’s medical needs. “But my stomach churned when it was time for his first supervised visit with his mum and dad. “His dad came bounding up, saying, ‘Thanks for looking after our boy. You’ll think us bad parents but it was just a terrible accident’. I couldn’t shake off the suspicion it was more than that.” In May 2015, Paula and Mark told social services they wanted to adopt him. A year later, he was legally theirs. Paula went straight to the police to voice her concerns but was told there was “insufficient evidence” to prove any abuse by Tony’s parents. She said: “I knew detectives were looking into the case but I had no right to information until I was Tony’s legal parent. “As soon as the adoption came through I contacted them and heard it had been dropped.  “I was devastated. I wrote a victim’s right to appeal letter to the CPS. Within weeks, a detective came to see me to explain why it hadn’t gone to court. I told them about my meeting with Tony’s real dad and what he’d said. He was shocked. He said there and then that he would re-look at the case.” Smith and Simpson were charged months later. They denied causing physical harm and cruelty to Tony. They told police they delayed taking Tony for medical help because they were waiting in for a plumber. Paula faced the pair in Maidstone Crown Court in February. She said: “I was terrified. But I’m a mum and you do anything for your child.” After the verdict, the judge told the court: “Tony’s adoptive family are stars. They are absolute stars.” Tony will be four in October and is learning to use prosthetic limbs, which he got just before Christmas last year.  Paula said: “He will never recover fully. Everything he does, he has to adapt to his own way. “Now he has stubbies – to try and help him use prosthetics in the future. He doesn’t like wearing them as they do restrict him. It’s a lot of hard work. “But he’s so happy. He took his first swim stroke without an arm band last weekend. We went on a day out to Peppa Pig World and stayed the night. “I was so proud as it was a huge achievement for him. He absolutely loves life at the moment.” Paula said Tony loves sport and is \u0026shytaking tennis lessons. She also has a positive outlook on Tony’s lifelong disability. She said: “The absence of his legs will not be a lifelong \u0026shyreminder of his parents’ cruelty. “It will be a reminder of what an incredible human being he is. He is a lovely boy and I am so proud to call him my son.

The store in Tonypandy, Wales, was open when the fire broke out in the early hours of Saturday. The fire started at around 12.30am and appears to have taken place in the toiletries aisle with footage showing flames ripping through shelving units. Sam Sheppard, who was outside the Asda store at the time of the incident, said the emergency services arrived within minutes of the fire starting. I stayed there until roughly 2.40am and the fire crews and police were still there, said the 18-year-old.  There didn’t appear to be too many people shopping at the time – mainly workers restocking shelves and construction workers who were refitting the store. Everyone seemed to be annoyed and just shocked at the whole situation. South Wales Fire Service were called to the supermarket in Colliers Way at 12.37am on Saturday. A spokeswoman for the service said three fire engines and 15 firefighters attended the blaze, which saw the building evacuated. An Asda spokesman confirmed nobody had been injured.

One of Britain’s greatest \u0026shyever comics turns 80 on Monday. Generations of kids of all ages have guffawed at the antics of The Beano’s crazy characters. The catapult-firing \u0026shyterror Dennis the Menace, sly Roger the Dodger and \u0026shytomboy Minnie the Minx never seem to get old. And few fans have taken the likes of The Bash Street Kids to heart as much as house music DJ Stuart Jay.  He was bought his first subscription aged six and now, aged 45, has every edition – from July 30, 1938. The 80th anniversary edition will land on his doormat tomorrow. Stuart, who is single, stores his 3,945 comics, and 100 special editions and annuals in a locked storage room at his Surrey home. He says they are worth up to \u0026pound80,000.  He said: “Every so often one gets lost in the post and there are a couple of manic phone calls to find out what happened.” The self-confessed completist, who also has nearly all Now That’s What I Call Music! albums on CDs and vinyl, has paid from 10p to \u0026pound4,000 for copies to ensure his collection is complete. He said: “Since I was a kid, the comics have been a form of escapism.” This week Stuart will read about Moe’s Monkey Feet, a new strip created by children’s author and comedian David Walliams, who is guest editing the 80th anniversary edition.  The McManus museum, in the comic’s home city of Dundee, has also been re-branded McMenace for the big day. Kids are being encouraged to pick up a Beano as part of the Summer Reading Challenge. The Beano is the world’s longest-running weekly comic and had up to two millions readers in its 50s and 60s heyday. The Dennis the Menace Fan Club had 1.25 million members, including Star Wars actor Mark Hamill, now 66, who would read the comics with his young son. Comic auctioneer Phil Shrimpton, 37, (pictured above) is currently selling a Beano first issue for \u0026pound25,000.  He said: “It’s amazing that The Beano has withstood the test of time. It’s also nice that it’s still in the same building in Dundee. It’s just always been about fun and jokes – often bad ones.” He credits the \u0026shyenduring success to the talent of its artists. He said a handful made hilarious strips for years. Among them were David Law, who drew Dennis the Menace, Ken Reid, who created Roger the Dodger, and Leo Baxendale, the original Bash Street Kids and Minnie the Minx artist, who died last year. Dudley Watkins – responsible for drawing the Lord Snooty strip – \u0026shyfamously died of a heart attack at his easel in 1969.

The couple, from Hull, booked him to tile their bathroom but he left the job unfinished and the property in a complete mess, with rubbish piled in every room. But they say the man still wants to be paid in full - and has taken their house keys for ransom until they do so. The houseowner and mum-of-one, aged 24, who asked not to be named, booked the tradesman online. We asked around for recommendations but nobody knew of anyone who could do the work, she told Hull Live .  We found a guy that said he could do the work at a decent price, so we agreed to take him on. The first night on the Monday we checked into the house to see how he was getting on, as we aren\u0027t living in it at the moment until it is all done up, and it all looked fine. We didn\u0027t have time to call in on Tuesday, but on the Wednesday when the work was meant to be finished, we walked in to an absolute bomb site. She says the tiler left a mess in nearly every room of the house, and thinks what he has done in the home is completely disrespectful. Grout was all up the walls, the tiles were wonky, the mosaic doesn\u0027t go all the way up the ceiling and the floor tiles are ruined, she said. We\u0027re also going to need a new bath as he let grout fall in there and took the protective peel off it, and now all the grout has hardened and scratched it. He trashed the bedroom that will be my son\u0027s by leaving all the rubbish in there and he left the kitchen in a state with grout splattered all up the walls where he mixed it for the tiles - why he didn\u0027t go outside to mix it I just can\u0027t understand. He also left mucky hand prints on the fridge and had unplugged it after helping himself to all our drinks. The carpets in the rooms were also left a mess where he had walked about and left tile cuttings.  The tiler still quoted \u0026pound360 for the work, but the homeowners say they are not paying it and estimate it may now cost another \u0026pound500 to put right his work and replace items he ruined. We offered him \u0026pound100 for the work so that he would give us his house keys back, which we though was a fair contribution, but he\u0027s demanded more money off us and has said the bathroom has been left like it is because the walls are poor. His wife has called us screaming down the phone to demand money from us, and he\u0027s emotionally blackmailed us by saying his daughter is giving him money from her piggy bank as we aren\u0027t paying him. We just can\u0027t afford it, though, when we are going to have to pay out so much to fix what he\u0027s done. The couple say the situation has taken its toll and they are now worried about employing another tiler. My partner is absolutely livid about it all and I\u0027m really annoyed, she said.

It\u0027s actually the most likely time of the year that your vehicle will run into problems. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to prevent a problem before it occurs. Below we\u0027ve pulled together everything you need to know to try and get around some of the most common issues, from where not to drive to what you need to check today.  We already know that summer can cause problems with your car battery , sapping it of essential fluids and running performance into the ground.   But you can get that checked with a Halfords Car Battery Fitting Service where in-store experts can fit a new one if necessary, with prices for a Halfords Car Battery starting at \u0026pound58.   When am I most likely to break down?    Department for Transport figures have revealed that in 2016, August was the peak month for breakdown incidents, with 17,777 cars needing the help of a breakdown service.  In the years, 2014 and 2015, July was the peak month, with 20,129 and 18,588 incidents recorded. The figures also reveal that Friday is the day most cars end up on the hard shoulder of England\u0027s motorways. And while the month varies across years, Friday was a constant in being the day most likely for cars to breakdown.  Which road is a breakdown blackspot?  The M1 is the undisputed leader in breakdowns. Between 2014 and 2016 there were 78,672 reported incidents. The M25 was a close second (71,933 breakdowns) and the M6 third (71,134 incidents).   One way that you can avoid additional stress on your engine (not to mention delays), is by avoiding heavy traffic. Using a sat nav like the Garmin Drive 51LMT-S with UK and Ireland Maps 5 Sat Nav - now \u0026pound88 (save \u0026pound31.99) is a great way to prevent hitting jams as it offers alerts when there are delays on your route.   Pair it with a dashcam to film everything that happens in front of you on the road - such as the Nextbase Dashcam 412GW , now \u0026pound103 (save \u0026pound26). You might find this gives you additional piece of mind. The device boasts QUAD HD 1440p High Definition recording at 30 frames per second to capture a 140\u0026deg viewing angle to capture the entire road ahead. This helps to provide you with instant evidence to support insurance claims in helping prove an accident was not your fault.   How to prevent a breakdown   A modern car is a marvel of engineering. For the most part you can be sure it will give you years of reliable service. However, your tyres, battery and engine oil levels should also be regularly checked. In the summer, engine oil gets hotter, making it less viscous. This can put a strain on the components in your engine and could lead to a serious problem.  Not having the right level of oil in your car will make this worse, so check regularly and top up with a good quality oil. Pop into a local Halfords store (no appointment needed), and trained experts will check your engine oil levels and top it up if needed. They can also advise on the best engine oil for your car.   Not everyone has the time to get under the bonnet, so a Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

It begins with one of the staff in a blue tank top remonstrating with the youth who is sitting down looking angry and close to tears. The youth then stands up as the member of staff puts his arm around him to console him, but the boy brushes him off. The boy then approaches another member of staff who is standing to the side, and punches him with his left fist, saying: “Are you taking the p***?” The first member of staff separates the two as the boy storms out of the barbers, continuing to complain.

Shock figures from NHS Digital show hospitals dealt with 5,000 cases of \u0026shyaddicted tots over the last four years. NAS – neonatal abstinence syndrome – affects babies whose mums have abused drugs during pregnancy. When the umbilical cord is cut, the supply of drugs suddenly stops, so the addicted infant goes cold turkey.  Typical symptoms include high-pitched or incessant crying, tremors, vomiting and sweating. But babies can also suffer dehydration, diarrhoea, fevers and even seizures. Some may need medication to treat severe withdrawal symptoms, usually from the same family of drugs as the substance that the baby is \u0026shyaddicted to. Once the signs of withdrawal are controlled, the dosage is gradually decreased to help wean the baby off the drug. Figures from the NHS show the problem is countrywide. Its Clinical Commissioning Group for Basildon and Brentwood in Essex handled the cases of 44 \u0026shybabies needing treatment for neonatal withdrawal symptoms in 2016/17 – the highest number for that year.  Thurrock CCG looked after 33 tots, Sandwell and West Birmingham, 26, Northern Eastern and Western Devon, 23, and Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, 22. But there is not much help for the babies or their mums outside hospital. There is just one women-only rehab service in the country – Trevi House in Plymouth – where mums can get support and treatment while living on-site with their babies. Chief executive Hannah Shead said: “Years ago there were lots of services like ours, but one by one they have all closed due to funding cuts. Services like ours aren’t given priority when it comes to funding because, sadly, a lot of people feel addicts don’t deserve help.  “Yet none of the women we support wanted to end up in this position. Most are victims of childhood sexual trauma and domestic violence. The shame and guilt they feel is huge. But all they need is help and support to break the cycle. “A mum might come to us on baby four or five. Her previous children have all been taken into care. “By getting her through treatment, addressing her underlying issues and enabling her to keep her child, we break that cycle of repeat removal.” “Not only is that the best outcome for the family, it means we save money too because the costs associated with putting children in care are phenomenal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"travellers slam council saying litter","story":"NewsTravellers slam council saying litter left at their illegal camp \u0027could make their kids sick\u0027Travellers at the camp in Plympton, Plymouth are angry about the rubbish on the road and pavements and say it is \u0027a health and safety risk\u0027Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySarah LumleyCarl Eve19:06, 28 JUL 2018NewsTravellers in Plymouth are complaining about litter left at their illegal camp and think the council should clean it up (Image: SWNS)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA group of travellers who set up an illegal camp have slammed the council saying litter is posing a health and safety risk.

It was a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of problems as severe thunderstorms disrupted hundreds of flights into and out of Britain, and travellers also had to deal with technical faults and a security scare. In Manchester, a group of Girl Guide volunteers en route to an orphanage in Romania were stuck at the airport for seven hours after their flight to Frankfurt was cancelled. British families heading home from a summer holiday in Spain were forced to sleep on the hard floor at Palma de Mallorca Airport, where a flight delay had left them stranded for 16 hours.  Tens of thousands of passengers across the UK faced an agonising wait for updates after their flights were delayed or cancelled, largely due to severe thunderstorms which capped a weeks-long heatwave. For many families, the start of their summer holidays began with anger and disappointment as they spent hours stuck inside crowded terminals. Manchester mum Natalie Ward, 31, told  she was travelling with her four children - Harmoni, 13, Daisy, 10, Junior, five, and Roxie, two - who were all exhausted and desperate to get home after sleeping on the floor at Palma\u0027s airport.  The Tui customer said: We’re stuck in Palma airport and it\u0027s been 16 hours. My kids have been sleeping on floor because it\u0027s peak season and there are no hotels available. The first flight couldn\u0027t leave because staff worked over their [maximum allowable] hours and the second time it was delayed with a technical fault. They\u0027re saying we should be flying at some point later today, but we are waiting on a plane to arrive from Manchester and take us back. Everyone here is angry. There are two day staff on, doing their best and giving us updates as and when they can. The family and fellow passengers eventually boarded a plane and began their journey home.  A Tui spokesperson said: “We would like to apologise for any inconvenience to customers who were delayed on board TOM2587 coming back to Manchester from Palma. The delay was due to earlier delays as a result of the weather in the UK which then impacted crew hours and then unfortunately we had a further delay due to a technical issue. We provided all customers with vouchers for refreshments and we can confirm that they are now on their way home. We understand how frustrating a flight delay can be and we would like to thank affected customers for their patience and understanding. We have a dedicated team at Manchester airport ready to assist customers on their return.  Meanwhile, the 10 Girl Guides and three leaders, from the North West England region, were due to travel to Romania to spend 10 days volunteering at an orphanage, the Manchester Evening News reports. But when they arrived at the airport in the early hours of Saturday morning they discovered their Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt had been cancelled. It meant the guides would also miss their connecting flight to Bucharest. The leaders said they were unable to find any staff at the airport to help them book another flight, and Lufthansa’s group booking number only operates Monday to Friday.  They were given food vouchers and told to wait in a shopping area before security, but the shops did not open until 8am. Following a seven-hour wait the guides were able to book onto two new flights on Monday morning, but they won\u0027t arrive until 1am on Tuesday, cutting their trip short to just six days. They will be put up in a hotel until then, as many have travelled to Manchester Airport from Cumbria, Chester and the Isle of Man. The guides, aged 14 to 17, have spent a year fundraising for the charity trip where they will be helping an orphanage to become self-sustainable. Guide leader Becky Latham, 21, said: “Nobody at the airport could book us onto another flight. We called the group booking number but it only operates Monday to Friday.  She added: “We were all super excited. But then getting to the airport and seeing the flight was cancelled was disappointing. “The girls have been in high spirits, but they are starting to lag now. It has been getting on for nine hours now.” She later said: “Thankfully we have just been booked on to two flights on Monday with one flight getting in 1am Tuesday. We miss a large portion of our project but we will make the difference that we can.” Amid Saturday\u0027s chaos, one of the worst-hit airports was Stansted in Essex, where passengers were sat on the floor and stood in long queues inside the packed terminal. Ryanair cancelled 14 flights, blaming overnight thunderstorms and air traffic control staff shortages.  A spokesman for the airport said no other airline had cancelled flights although there were more delays following the UK\u0027s extreme weather and thunderstorms in Europe. Travellers departing from Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Manchester airports were also affected by delays. The Met Office said more than 17,000 lightning strikes were recorded over the UK during the storms. A statement from NATS, which controls the UK\u0027s airspace, said earlier: The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorm activity across London and the East of England, with flights likely to be adversely affected. NATS is working closely with the airports and airlines to ensure safety and to continue providing the most efficient operation possible during this adverse weather period. Dealing with bad weather is one of the most difficult things for air traffic controllers to manage. Its unpredictable nature means aircraft aren’t able to fly their usual routes, resulting in unusual flight patterns.

Heavy rainfall and a dramatic drop in temperatures brought an abrupt end to the glorious summer heatwave for many on Saturday. More than a month\u0027s worth of rain fell at Belfast International Airport, with the torrential downpours causing flooding and traffic disruption across the region. A yellow weather warning for rain was in place for western parts of Scotland on Saturday, while a warning for wind and rain covers Wales and the south of England today.  Winds of up to 50mph are forecast for exposed coasts and hills with as much as 80mm of rain possible in the Brecon Beacons and Dartmoor, the Met Office said. Flooding is possible and large waves are likely in coastal areas, the forecaster added, warning of potential damage to tents and other temporary structures. Saturday was the first day this month that nowhere in the UK reached at least 25C, the forecaster added, marking a 10-degree drop from Thursday which saw the hottest day of the year so far. Cavendish in Suffolk and Weybourne in Norfolk enjoyed Saturday\u0027s UK high of 24C.  As thunderstorms brought the first significant rainfall for weeks to the UK, Belfast International Airport saw 88.2mm in just a few hours - above the July average for the entire region, which sits at 81.2mm. Meteorologist Sarah Kent said that, unlike thunderstorms in many other parts of the UK, those in Northern Ireland came as a result of low pressure, rather than directly relating to the recent heatwave. Short Ferry in Lincolnshire had 41.8mm of rainfall in one hour on Friday, nearing the county\u0027s monthly July average of 55.8mm. Heavy, thundery showers will continue as changeable weather replaces the hot spell much of the UK has endured for weeks.  It\u0027s a very unsettled weather picture across the whole of the UK, said meteorologist Sarah Kent. She said campers especially should take heed of the windy weather. She said: The warning is in place particularly for holidaymakers who are out camping or towing their caravans, they are going to see some very strong gusts. Sunday\u0027s highs are expected to remain much nearer normal for the time of year, with the south of England likely to see the mercury struggle to climb higher than the low 20s in southern England. While some will have welcomed the rain and the cooler temperatures, those keen to catch a glimpse of the blood moon, the longest lunar eclipse of the 21st century, on Friday were disappointed by cloud cover. Holidaymakers were beset by delays and cancellations due to the extreme weather on Saturday.  A number of flights were affected, and travellers suffered long delays waiting for ferries and cross-Channel trains. Two bodies were recovered on Saturday in separate incidents following concerns people had got into difficulties in water. The body of a 15-year-old was recovered in Essex. Police said the teenager, provisionally named as Ben Quartermaine, was found near Clacton Pier after a search which began on Thursday. In Bedfordshire the body of a man aged in his late 20s was recovered from the Great Ouse river after reports someone had got into difficulty there on Friday afternoon.

The pregnant woman was a passenger in a truck when the driver lost control on a motorway and the vehicle flipped. When the vehicle turned over she was thrown from the cabin and crushed by the truck\u0027s load of wood, which tore the baby from her belly. Shocked medics found the dead woman underneath the wooden planks spilled on the road, then discovered the crying baby girl several metres away, according to reports.  Incredibly the infant, whose umbilical cord had been severed during the accident, was found in perfect health and without a single scratch following the incident near Cajati, between Sao Paulo and Curitiba, in south-east Brazil. She is now being treated at the nearby Pariquera-Acu regional hospital\u0027s neonatal intensive care ward. Police and social services are reportedly trying to identify the child\u0027s deceased mother, who was 39 weeks pregnant and was found without any documents.  Elton Fernando Barbosa, the paramedic who was first on the scene of the accident on the BR-116 highway on Thursday, told Brazil\u0027s A Tribuna newspaper: It was a serious accident with one reported person deceased. When I arrived there, I saw that the truck driver was injured, and he was seen by the first aid team. I went looking for the fatal victim who was underneath the wood, when I heard the cries of a baby.  It was which total apprehension, because there had been no reports of a third victim. He said he found the baby several metres away from the mother, and quickly called for the ambulance to take her to hospital. He added: The foetus was literally expelled by the impact on the mother, the impact was so great that this opened up the mother\u0027s belly and the child was ejected.  She was perfect, healthy, without a scratch. We can say that, in those circumstances, it was really a miracle that she survived. I\u0027ll be honest. It was God. By what I saw, I have no idea how she came out alive. The mother was underneath several planks of wood. I don\u0027t know how this child got out of their with her life.

When she realised that her other half wasn\u0027t going to show up for their nuptials, Manow took to a stage to tell her guests that the wedding wasn\u0027t going ahead. Clad in her beautiful princess gown, she told her guests that after planning the wedding for months it hadn\u0027t turned out the way she hoped.   The Bangkok Post reports that Manow, 24, apologised to the crowd for what had happened and thanked her parents and friends for helping her to organise the wedding.  The video has since gone viral and has been viewed more than five million times. Manow has received hundreds of messages of support with one telling her: Keep fighting, I\u0027m rooting for you! Another said: Keep fighting, sister, be strong, you are beautiful. Before the wedding the couple had sent out 1,000 invites and had pictures of them put on billboards.  The newspaper also reports the couple had only been dating for a short time before getting engaged. It has also been reported that Phakin, 18, said he did not show up because his family could not pay the dowry requested. The bride\u0027s family reportedly requested a dowry of 200,000 baht (\u0026pound4,500) in cash and gold ornaments.

Her friend also asked her to send back the outfit she was due to wear so another friend could wear it.

However, the following day Courtney told her followers that they had refunded the full cost of her cross-country flights.  Wow, did not expect this response - clearly the situation resonated. Thanks @jetblue for providing the refund I was hoping for, and thanks to everyone for chiming in with well wishes, humour, and even devil’s advocacy. She added: Weddings have gotten totally out of control - this is about more than just an email. I’m hoping this thread reminds future lovebirds and bridal parties to keep their feet on the ground.  But Courtney\u0027s post divided Twitter users with some suggesting the email was perfectly reasonable. There must be some back story that I\u0027m missing because the email request seems reasonable and considerate to me, one wrote. But others said she could have at least called her: Email was tacky and she should have called, a second shared. Bridesmaids should be there for the entire wedding festivities. She didn’t disinvite her but just took that extra crap off her plate.... But we only know one side.

After freeing 11 out of the 12 teens, Mr Mallinson told of his terror when he put an oxygen mask over the final boy - to find it did not fit. He said: “We put it on him, really strapped down tight so his nose was flattened against his face and there was a big gap under his chin. We just couldn’t get it to seal.”  The British diver added the boy had already been dosed up with ketamine to keep him calm during the escape, and feared he could drown. Running out of time as heavy rainfall loomed, Mr Mallinson made the quick decision to use a replacement mask on the boy to get him out as soon as possible. “We knew we didn’t have any more time and we knew this was the last option,” Mr Mallinson said.  Using a technique where he pulled the boy close and used his own body as a shield, the diver managed to pull him out of the murky water without letting his head hit the cave wall - as this could have knocked off his mask. He added he hit his head several times during the rescue but needed to keep swimming quickly before the boy developed hypothermia. Chris Jewell, who was rescuing the second to last boy, also ran into trouble during his final rescue. He told the programme how he lost grip of the three-inch rope that was used to lead them out of the cave and could not regain hold of it.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

At well over six feet, the former Blackburn and Bayern Munich kid fits the bill on that score.And, over the next few days, the coaching staff will see if he is up to scratch in terms of his all-round striking ability.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united duo face fitness checks ahead of elgin city clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Curran and Callum Booth will face fitness checks before Csaba Laszlo decides his line-up for Dundee United’s Betfred Cup trip to Elgin today.Injury means the pair, regarded as among the most significant of the Tangerines’ summer signings, have hardly been seen in the games played so far.Curran’s only public appearance to date was in the friendly at Brechin earlier this month and he’s been struggling to shake off a dead leg.But Csaba remains hopeful he’ll be ready for next week’s Championship opener with Dunfermline.And, if he’s fit enough to manage 45 minutes at Borough Briggs, it would be a major step in the right direction.Booth, meanwhile, took a knock in the defeat at Ross County last week and that ruled him out of the home tie against Alloa.While the former Partick Thistle full-back’s condition is not causing concern, United would like him to get another game under his belt before the league.In line for debuts could be latest recruits Paul Watson and Yannik Loemba.Watson, who arrived from Falkirk last week, is likely to partner Frederic Frans at the heart of the defence, while wide man Loemba is could be on the wing.Having not played since the turn of the year, the 28-year-old is likely to need a few weeks to get his fitness up to scratch.With qualification out reach for both, all that’s at stake today is avoiding the wooden spoon.Csaba sees this as vital preparation for next week.“Especially before the season begins, I say always this is the most important game for the confidence, just to win,” said Csaba.“You do and you know you can score goals.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united hand trial to former bayern munich and blackburn rovers star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo will have a look a player with a strong football pedigree as he tries to add to his attacking options at Dundee United.Today will see Austria Vienna reserve striker Toni Vastic arrive for a trial with the Tangerines.Now 25, Vastic spent time with both Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich’s second team in his younger days and also has experience of top flight football in his native Austria.And his father Ivica, though born in Croatia, won 50 caps for Austria between 1996 and 2008 as well as starring for the likes of Strum Graz and Austria Vienna, for whom he is now a youth coach.Csaba did not confirm Vastic is the player he was bringing over but did concede it was a striker from Vienna who is strong in the air and there is no doubt Vastic is that man.It was through the manager’s contacts in central Europe that the deal to bring him over for a tryout was done.“We are working to bring players in. I don’t make any secret that we are bringing someone in from Austria Vienna, a big striker, I can have a look at,” said Csaba.“We are talking with one other player and hope the signings can be made, the deals are done.“I hope by next week we will have a complete team.”United also hope to be boosted by the sight of another new striker, Craig Curran, making his debut when they complete their Betfred Cup campaign at Elgin City this Saturday.Curran was due back in training today after the dead leg that’s sidelined him for the past two weeks.If he completes his work over the next couple of days without suffering a reaction, he will be on duty up north and back on course to be ready for the league kick-off against Dunfermline next week.“We have been working on Craig and, if he is OK, he can get 45 minutes against Elgin and that would be good news.”Defender Callum Booth is another who has been in the wars but could be back on duty at the weekend.The former Partick Thistle man picked up a knock at Ross County last week and missed out against Alloa but could be ready over the next couple of days.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes. Paul is more of a winger and we cannot give him high balls and expect him to win headers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-european-championships-cycling-trial-glasgow-road-closures-in-place","story":"                          THOUSANDS of drivers and commuters are being warned to rethink travel plans ahead of a cycling event which will bring major roads to a standstill."},{"url":null,"title":"davie-hay-young-celtic-defenders-showing-signs-of-finding-their-feet","story":"                          THERE has been much talk about the young partnership at the heart of the Celtic defence, and I am aware that the Rosenborg goal on Wednesday night came from Jack Hendry giving the ball away."},{"url":null,"title":"davie-hay-celtic-hold-all-the-cards-in-poker-match-with-hibs-over-john-mcginn","story":"                          I think John McGinn will eventually end up at Celtic Park, although that may be in January or even next summer."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-centre-streets-closed-this-weekend-for-repair-works","story":"                          BUSY Glasgow\u0026nbspCity Centre streets will be closed this weekend for repair works."},{"url":null,"title":"pharmacies-could-help-speed-up-gp-waiting-times-with-24-hour-service","story":"                          PHARMACIES could open 24 hours a day, with staff trained to prescribe medication, in a bid to tackle Scotland\u0027 GP \u0026ldquocrisis, the Conservatives have suggested."},{"url":null,"title":"adorable-ferret-found-abandoned-in-box-in-motherwell","story":"                          THE Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after an adorable ferret was found in the middle of a road."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-beach-party-is-happening-to-celebrate-the-finale-here-is-all-the-details","story":"                          A BEACH party is being held to celebrate the finale of hit ITV2 show Love Island.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"gabriella-marcella-glasgow-artist-brightening-rail-journeys-at-queen-street","story":"                          A GLASGOW artist has brought colour to one of Glasgow\u0027 biggest canvases as the multi-million pound redevelopment of Queen Street station gathers pace."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-dad-captures-stunning-image-of-fork-lightning-above-three-firth-of-forth-bridges","story":"                          This is the electrifying photo of the moment lightning filled the sky above the Forth Road bridge as Scotland battles thunderstorms this weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-pro-wrestler-dale-storm-seeks-to-reconnect-with-friends","story":"                          An ex-professional wrestler is hoping to have a reunion with two opponents he used to battle with in the ring more than 40 years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"holiday-makers-heading-for-the-sun-delayed-amid-extreme-weather","story":"                          Holidaymakers are experiencing long delays on flights, ferries and Eurotunnel trains amid extreme weather conditions in the UK and thunderstorms across Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"beverley-lyons-catching-bonnie-tyler-and-midge-ure-in-scots-festival-was-amazing","story":"                          BONNIE Tyler is a real legend so it was brilliant to meet her at Rewind festival.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"msp-james-kelly-calls-for-independent-review-of-football-policing-after-fans-filmed-at-parkhead","story":"                          A LABOUR MSP who played a leading role in the repeal of a contentious anti-sectarianism law has backed an independent review into football policing."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-scottish-borders-mum-is-struck-by-lightning-while-filming-in-galashiels","story":"                          A GALASHIELS mum feared she was going to die after being \u0027stuck by lightning\u0027."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03942000/03942129.jpg","title":"Belladrum Festival and Black Isle Show travel advice","story":"\u0026nbspPolice have issued travel advice ahead of two majpr events taking place next week.The Black Isle Show\u0026nbspreturns to\u0026nbspMuir of Ord on Wednesday and Thursday, August 1 and 2 and the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival is on from Thursday to Sunday, August 2-5.Police Scotland is supporting advice from the organisers for attendees to plan their travel in advance and leave extra time for their journeys -

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page

Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from

has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty.

The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine.

Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.

Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

I\u0027d have been better off if it had gone down at sea, rather than coming aground here.\"  Mr Ramsay\u0027s boat the Reaper II ran aground after suffering damage while four miles off Prestonpans beach at the end of last month.  He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-at-scotlands-national-airshow-2018-on-saturday","story":"  Final preparations are under way for the event, which will see the acrobatic squad perform a new Centenary Split manoeuvre, specially introduced into their 2018 display to mark this year\u0026rsquos 100th anniversary of the RAF.

Having once been consigned to weekend clubs and small, local competitions, events such as the OWL have proved it is possible to fill arenas with people to watch 12 players battle in one video game.  While games such as Pokemon Go and Fortnite have proved in recent years that almost anyone can be lured into the thrill of gaming on some level, eSports competitions such as the OWL are proving they are viable entertainment for spectators too.  The key, according to league commissioner Nate Nanzer, has been taking an approach to league structure similar to \u0026ldquotraditional sports. In Overwatch\u0026rsquos case that meant city-based teams \u0026ndash not something widely used by other competitions.  \u0026ldquoWe saw an opportunity to take this incredible game, to take a structure around city-based teams, that works in other sports \u0026ndash let\u0026rsquos apply that to eSports let\u0026rsquos borrow best practices from sports leagues, he said.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove said it before that one of our goals for the Overwatch League is in the future for it to become just as common for a mum and dad to come home from work, grab the family and go watch an Overwatch League match as it is today to do that for baseball, hockey or basketball, and what I\u0026rsquove seen this season is incredibly encouraging and we\u0026rsquore well on our way to doing that.  Pete Vlastelica, Activision Blizzard\u0026rsquos president of eSports leagues, said the growth of the OWL has surprised even those who created it.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos bigger than we expected. We expected the Overwatch League to be huge, we went into it with that ambition. People called us crazy, but we didn\u0026rsquot expect it to get this big this fast, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe first week, we saw about twice as many viewers as we expected and over the course of the season, we\u0026rsquove reached about twice as many as we were expecting.  \u0026ldquoSelling out this venue (Barclays Centre), all the excitement around the league, not just at league level but at team level \u0026ndash fans are starting to attach themselves to teams in ways that we didn\u0026rsquot expect so soon because we\u0026rsquore not even playing all of our games in London or Philadelphia, we\u0026rsquore playing all our matches in Los Angeles and yet these teams\u0026rsquo fan bases are starting to pop up all over the world.  Part of that growth could be down to some of the attention to detail the teams have shown when trying to tie themselves to their adopted cities.  The London Spitfire team does not feature any UK-based players \u0026ndash the entire roster is South Korean \u0026ndash but team owner Jack Etienne revealed that they took inspiration from British sport when designing the Spitfire logo.  \u0026ldquoFor the logo we had lots of ideas for design but we ended up with something that we think really is a nod to the English Premier League in that the logo and badge really represents the region, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe feel like the response has been really positive and we\u0026rsquore really proud of it.  Mr Nanzer also pointed to the players as a key factor of the league\u0026rsquos growth, many of them now living in a similar fashion to other athletes, training and preparing for competition.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove worked incredibly hard to get here, he said.  \u0026ldquoPlaying video games every day to the average person may not seem super challenging, but as somebody who gets to sit and watch players work every day, they spend so much time and energy building their mind and body \u0026ndash really breaking stereotypes of maybe what people think it means to be a gamer.  But it is not just in the OWL where the rise of eSports is being accelerated \u0026ndash on the same weekend of the OWL Grand Finals, Call Of Duty and popular battle royale game PlayerUnknown\u0026rsquos Battlegrounds (PUBG) have been holding their own tournaments.  The Fifa eWorld Cup Finals are also due to take place in early August in London, with the winner picking up a 250,000 dollar (\u0026pound190,000) prize.  Talks have been confirmed with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the possibility of eSports joining the Games in the future.  If you are yet to witness an eSports contest for yourself, it is highly possible that will change in the years to come."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7061606.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-ferret-found-abandoned-in-box-in-motherwell","story":"  Scotland\u0026rsquos animal welfare charity was alerted after a member of public found a box, containing the ferret, on Wilsons Road, in Hareshaw, Motherwell, on Saturday, July 21.

However, now the forgotten history of one of the country\u0027s most celebrated marvels is beginning to be told, thanks to a new exhibition which raises awkward questions about the role the slave trade played in its foundation.  Leading Jamaican-born academic and human rights campaigner Sir Geoff Palmer, Emeritus Professor in the School of Life Sciences at Heriot-Watt University and also Scotland\u0027s first black professor, has given stinging critique in an interview with The Herald on how \"slavery is the history of the New Town\", down to how it shaped individual homes.    Jamaican plantation. Getty Images  He said James Craig and Robert Adam\u0027s streets were partly owned by slave plantation owners or funders, with often hundreds of slaves in their keep.  He said: \"After emancipation in 1833, people were given compensation (for the loss of slaves) because officially the slaves were property.  \"If you look at the New Town, on the compensation list you will find various areas like India Street, Albany Street, Forth Street and nearby Rodney Street.  \"For example, when you look at one building you would think it is just an ordinary house.  \"But when you look at it carefully, which I have - and it is on the compensation list - the person there who received money for their slaves is the only house that has a balcony.\"  He said:\u0026nbsp\"If you go to another, also on the compensation list, it has two doors to the one house.  \"It is not just that a lot of the houses in the New Town are on the compensation list, those which are on the compensation list have got appointments (fittings), have got differences - so having slaves made your house different.\"  The compensation list includes 320 Edinburgh addresses belonging to 148 individuals.    A kind of paradise: Parts of St Ann Parish in Jamaica are hotspots for British tourists\u0026nbsp(Image: PA)  One in Forth Street was compensated \u0026pound277 for relinquishing nine slaves in Tobago, another in Albany Street received \u0026pound1,996 for giving up 104 \u0026ldquoenslaved\" in Jamaica, and one Dundas Street home-owner got \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2,956 15s 6d for 194 slaves in St Ann, a Jamaican district that was the\u0026nbspbirthplace of Bob Marley and Marcus Garvey.  In all, the British government paid out \u0026pound20m to compensate about 3,000 families that owned slaves for the loss of \"property\" when slave-ownership was abolished - the equivalent of around \u0026pound16.5bn today.  Prof Palmer said much of the management of slave funds would have come under the head of one of the biggest banks, the former first Lord of the Admiralty - who is commemorated on the 150ft plinth in the city\u0027s St Andrew Square, itself the subject of discussions on adding a plaque outlining his slavery connections - Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.    Slave ship. Getty Images  He said: \"The one we all know about is Dundas, because he was a politician, but he is significant because he controlled and managed the people who would have had property in the New Town.  \"He was the governor of the Bank of Scotland. He was funding slavery. He was the great patronage giver.  \"Dundas proposed that slavery should be gradually abolished.  \"Dundas did that in order to counteract those people who wanted immediate abolition.  \"Some historians said he wasn\u0026rsquot a bad guy because he wanted to do it gradually so that was better.  \"It\u0026rsquos not.  \"It was a deception.  \"This was how he protected the people who lived in the New Town.\"    New Town. Image: Gordon Terris  Prof Palmer said:\u0026nbsp\"My view - and I know the present viscount - is that I don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down or damaged, because once you start removing things, that\u0026rsquos removing the evidence, and you remove the deed.  \"I would like to see the truth of what was done on the plaque\u0026nbspthat he was the proponent of gradual abolition of slavery that kept the trade going for 15 years longer than it should.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\"What that means was 42,000 slaves who were transported each year by Britain would not have been.  \"That is the history of the New Town.\"    Henry Dundas was ultimately impeached over misappropriation of public money.  The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust\u0026nbspsaid the Tron Kirk exhibition, which also highlights Scotland\u0026rsquos other five World Heritage Sites, sets out the formal reasons for the city\u0026rsquos Unesco inscription, but also \"challenges residents and visitors to think differently about the city and consider some uncomfortable questions\".  These\u0026nbspinclude the absence of women in the city\u0026rsquos many grand statues and monuments and whether we are doing enough to conserve the authenticity of the site.

Her comments come at a time when there is an increasing focus on research as a way of boosting the income of universities.  University rankings, which are seen as crucial to the recruitment of students both at home and overseas, are also heavily weighted towards research output.  Ms McDougall said the skills required to be the best researcher were not the same as the skills required to be a great educator.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe journey to becoming an academic is very focussed on research skills with the pressure to publish and remain active in research, but there is not the same focus on educational skills.  \u0026ldquoIt is not surprising that many do not excel at teaching unless they have a natural ability and, given a number of undergraduate courses are taught by graduate teaching assistants, many of whom are only a few years ahead of the graduates they\u0026rsquore teaching, means we cannot expect them to be naturally gifted educators.  Ms McDougall, who was speaking at a teaching excellence summit at Glasgow University run by the Times Higher Education magazine, called for universities to spend more time developing academics.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe require primary and secondary school teachers to undergo intensive training before we allow them into the classroom, but we don\u0026rsquot expect the same from academics and I don\u0026rsquot really understand why there is a general assumption that academics can teach without dedicated training.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a lot more time invested by universities in developing academics as educators. That would help students feel more valued.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a risk for undergraduate students to feel sidelined by research activity in a university and we are all very aware of the tensions that exist for academics between splitting their time.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a tendency for undergraduates to feel secondary - an afterthought - to the main activity of research in a research-intensive university.  Mary Senior, Scotland Official for the University and College Union, which represents lecturers, said teaching was of a high quality, but could be affected by staff contracts which were often insecure.  She said: \u0026ldquoAccredited teacher training courses and qualifications should be accessible to all members of academic staff, and flexible enough to reflect major disciplinary differences within higher education.  \u0026ldquoThe real issue is teaching-only contracts can mean the exploitation of staff on casual contracts, and the fact that, although students often don\u0026rsquot realise it, most of them will be taught at some point by people on insecure casual contracts.  A spokesman for Universities Scotland, which represents principals, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a long-stated position of our members that research informs teaching and there will also be a fine balancing act to ensure that students and academics get the most out of both elements."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-why-putins-army-of-spooks-have-set-their-sights-on-a-tiny-ex-yugoslav-state","story":"  That Mr Trump in a subsequent television interview lambasted Montenegro claiming that Montenegrins were \u0026ldquovery aggressive, while ludicrously suggesting its recent membership of Nato might trigger World War III, only convinced observers that this was Mr Trump speaking on Mr Putin\u0026rsquos behalf.  Most likely such notions were planted in the US President\u0026rsquos mind during that one-to-one session in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart. It\u0026rsquos long been no secret that Moscow by hook or by crook did all it could to prevent Montenegro becoming the latest Nato member, even though the little Balkan nation finally succeeded in doing so last year much to the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chagrin.  Working therefore on the basis that Mr Putin has had remarkable success in inducing Mr Trump to promote the Kremlin\u0026rsquos interests and parrot its agenda, it\u0026rsquos probably fair to expect another small Balkan country to become the subject of both men\u0026rsquos ire in the coming months.  I\u0026rsquom talking of course about Macedonia, or to give it its proper name as known at the United Nations, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom).  Names matter here, indeed in \u0026ldquoMacedonia\u0026rsquos case what the country is actually called is already impacting on its future political direction of travel and will almost certainly bring it opprobrium from the Kremlin and therefore de-facto Mr Trump.  But before looking at such a prospect, it\u0026rsquos first necessary to rewind back to where the contentious issue of Macedonia\u0026rsquos name comes from and an agreement it signed last month with Greece.  It was in 1991 in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia that Greece\u0026rsquos northern neighbour called itself Macedonia.  For its part Greece was none to pleased and objected to the name, fearing territorial claims and ambitions on its eponymous northern region that includes the country\u0026rsquos second city, Thessaloniki.  The fledging Macedonia did little to defuse Greek anger with among other gestures calling its main airport in its capital Skopje after Ancient Greek hero Alexander. All this though is itself now history, given that after years of bickering, protests and talks the two neighbours have now reached an agreement.  Under the deal, signed on June 17, Macedonia agreed to change its name to Republic of North Macedonia. In return Greece has agreed to end its long-standing blockade of Macedonia\u0026rsquos membership of Nato and the EU.  As so often happens in the Balkans though, not everything is that straightforward.  For starters if the deal is to be fully implemented, then Macedonians must show their support in a referendum and likewise the Greek parliament must be on side.  For the moment it\u0026rsquos the first of these domestic political hurdles that is proving the trickiest.  For just as Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his ruling social democrats (SDSM) pushes hard for the renaming referendum to take place in the Autumn, so one of two main opposition groups in the country, the VMRO-DPMNE party has pushed back. Its supporters see the deal as little more than a shameful capitulation to Athens, something Mr Zaev has condemned as backward looking.  \u0026ldquoInstead of boarding the train bound for the EU and Nato, he chose to stay on the dark side of history, Mr Zaev was recently quoted as saying of opposition leader Hristijan Mickovski\u0026rsquos reluctance to move forward with the renaming vote.  Despite the obvious acrimony between the two sides, many remain confident the name change ballot will still take place, opening the way for the new Republic of North Macedonia to become part of the Nato and EU fold.  Should things move in this direction then cue Mr Putin\u0026rsquos full efforts to thwart Macedonia\u0026rsquos Nato aspirations in much the same way he did in Montenegro. That much was already evident last month when according to authorities in Athens, Russia tried to pay off Greek clerics and officials to oppose the Macedonia-Greece deal.  The meddling prompted the Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras this month to expel two Russian diplomats and deny entry to two others, while accusing the Kremlin of \u0026ldquoconstant disrespect for Greece.  It was an extraordinary move by the normally Russophilic Greek government that has been one of Russia\u0026rsquos best European friends.  Moscow in turn responded by cancelling a planned visit to Athens by foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and the two countries continue to trade angry statements.  In Macedonia itself, meanwhile, evidence suggests that Russia\u0026rsquos GRU military spy service is already using the sensitive mood in the country to stir up nationalist and anti-Western resentment, and so hindering Macedonia\u0026rsquos referendum route to Nato.  A few weeks ago Macedonia interior ministry documents seen by the local partner of the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reportedly revealed one key source of payments to opponents of the renaming referendum.  According to the group\u0026rsquos investigative journalists, Ivan Savvidi, a Russian billionaire living in Greece who was formerly a member of the Russian parliament and United Russia party, made payments worth at least \u0026curren300,000 to recently created radical nationalist organisations willing to foment unrest in the country. A similar Russian role was also uncovered in neighbouring Greece.  Intelligence service watchers say that what has been unfolding in Macedonia is almost a carbon copy of what happened in Montenegro, though in the latter, Russian intelligence operatives were also involved in plotting a violent coup that would have ended in the assassination of Montenegro\u0026rsquos pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic.

Ash Amirahmardi, UK managing director of Arla Foods, spoke after ministers last week raised the spectre of foods and medicines being stockpiled as part of contingency planning in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place on customs.  Mr Amirahmardi told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme that 16% of UK dairy products are imported, and of those 98% were from Europe, saying: \u0026ldquoIf we have barriers at our ports then that is what is going to lead to increased prices and potentially supply issues.  He added that World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs \u0026ndash which would come into play if there was no Brexit deal \u0026ndash on dairy products are \u0026ldquopenal and that stockpiling produce is \u0026ldquonot something that is really practical for the dairy industry.  He said the average person in the UK consumes the equivalent of three pints of milk per day, adding: \u0026ldquoOne of the reasons they do is because of the nutritious benefits of it, but it is also accessible in terms of prices.  \u0026ldquoAny increase in the friction of movement of products will inevitably lead to higher costs and therefore one of our concerns is to make sure consumer prices are accessible post-Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"stunning-lightning-above-firth-of-forth-bridges-caught-on-camera","story":"  The spectacular image, captured by Sebastian Kuczynski on Thursday night, was taken as Scotland prepares to battle thunderstorms this weekend.\u0026nbsp  But the storm was not the only show laid on by the heavens as last night saw the longest \u0026ldquoblood moon eclipse of the 21st century.  Across the UK, clouds permitting, the Moon appeared completely red \u0026ndash fully eclipsed by Earth \u0026ndash between 9pm and 10.15pm.  And over the next few days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 and will be seen as a \u0026ldquobright red star where skies are clear.  And for those awake after 11pm they may have been able to catch a glimpse of the International Space Station (ISS), as it moved quickly across the sky from west to east.  It appeared like a bright star, before fading from sight a few minutes later.  But those hoping to witness these events will have to brave thunderstorms.  The hot weather broke on Thursday night when lightning dominated the skies. Father-of-two Mr Kuczynski was planning on having a quiet night in with his wife Joanna, 38, until he heard the loud thunder and lightning.\u0026nbsp  The 43-year-old photographer, from South Queensferry, Edinburgh, rushed outside with his camera at 10:50pm to capture the spectacular lightning.  And despite being a photographer for the more than 20 years, Mr Kuczynski saidit was one of the best pictures he has ever managed to capture.  He said: \u0026ldquoI love the picture. I was born in Poland so seeing this was a regular thing for me. Seeing lightning in Scotland is just amazing for me because it doesn\u0026rsquot happen very often.  The lightning also managed to hit a woman\u0026rsquos phone as she tried to film the thunderstorm.  Tracey Kutluol was filming the storm from her living room window when her iPhone was hit by a thunderbolt.  Ms Kutluol, 43, from Galashiels, said it was her new rubber phone cover \u0026ndashdelivered just hours before she was struck \u0026ndash that saved her life.  She said: \u0026ldquoI was trying to film how dark it was and hoping for a little lightning that I could capture, but I did not anticipate that it would hit me. The lightning hit the pop socket on my phone. And if I am being honest, that saved my life otherwise my phone would have probably exploded.  The storm also affected the trains after lightning damaged the signalling system on London North Eastern Railway, which operates trains on the East Coast Main Line between London and Scotland.\u0026nbsp  Will Lang, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \u0026ldquoThe heatwave conditions are coming to an end but while many places will remain dry, the thunderstorms could lead to torrential downpours in places."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-james-kelly-calls-for-independent-review-of-football-policing-after-fans-filmed-at-parkhead","story":"  James Kelly issued the call after a spat between the single force and a fans\u0026rsquo group over police officers filming supporters at a Celtic friendly match.  Introduced by Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP Government, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act (OBFA) was passed in response to trouble at an Old Firm match and after parcel bombs were sent to former Celtic manager Neil Lennon and others.  However, the law was derided by legal experts, football supporters and opposition politicians who believed it singled out fans for special treatment.  READ: Scottish Labour leader under pressure over anti-semitism row  READ: Richard Leonard should stop acting like Corbyn is his boss  Kelly, a Glasgow MSP, secured cross-party support this year to repeal a law that was described by one sheriff as \u0026ldquomince.  Although the Act has been scrapped, prosecutors have rebadged the outstanding charges as breaches of different legislation, a move critics believe is symptomatic of wider problems with the way football fans are dealt with by the criminal justice system.  During a recent pre-season friendly between Celtic and Standard Liege at Parkhead, a police officer pointed a video camera at a group of fans. After the incident was flagged up by Fans Against Criminalisation \u0026ndash a group which was set up to oppose the OBFA \u0026ndash the official Police Scotland Twitter account responded: \"Officers were deployed as a result of pro IRA songs being sung by a section of the crowd.\"  The force added: \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot want police filming supporters at the game, don\u0026rsquot commit a crime. Both tweets were posted in the name of Superintendent John McBride.  Kelly said: \u0026ldquoDespite the repeal of the Act four months ago, the policing strategy at games can feel over the top and I have heard from numerous fans that it is ruining their match days. Only the other weekend we saw a cop pointing a video camera at a stand filming individual fans just watching the football, and then the official Police Scotland account sending passive aggressive tweets telling fans not to commit crime.  \u0026ldquoAt any other event you would expect to be treated with dignity by the police. That is sadly not the case in Scotland. Football fans are second-class citizens to the SNP Government, and that is why Labour is calling for an independent review of the way football policing is carried out.  FAC asked the Police Scotland for clarification of the tweets, after which McBride emailed the group about the controversy: \u0026ldquoI was the match commander of that fixture and prior to the game information had been received that \u0027Ultra\u0027 fans from Belgium would be attending the fixture. Being unaware of the threat these fans posed, I instructed officers with cameras be included in the match day operation.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt no time in my response on Twitter did I indicate that I felt that anyone connected with Fans Against Criminalisation were (or indeed are) in any way responsible for any of the actions that led to the police filming fans at that fixture and I would hope that you accept this communication as confirmation of that.  Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: \"The policing of football matches is under constant review and while there is a general framework of how we approach them, the tactics and deployments will vary dependent on circumstances such as the nature of the match and the risk associated with it. As in the past, I or my colleagues will happily meet with any supporters\u0027 groups to discuss any concerns they may have.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-richard-leonard-should-stop-acting-like-jeremy-corbyn-is-his-boss","story":"  Jeremy Corbyn is pitted against the weakest Tory Prime Minister for more than 20 years. Theresa May\u0026rsquos troubled leadership could result in a formal split in her party and her vision of Brexit is likely to make voters worse off.  A focused and competent Opposition would be more than 20% in the lead in the opinion polls. The parliamentary Labour party would be united behind the leader and MPs would be positioning themselves for places in Government.  The reality is Labour is barely ahead of a struggling Tory party and is tearing itself apart about what constitutes prejudice towards Jews.  Anti-Semitism has always existed in pockets of the Left. Criticism of the current Likud-led coalition in Israel is entirely merited, but some individuals seem incapable of distinguishing between the appalling Benjamin Netanyahu and conspiracy theories involving banking, Mossad and Nazis.  The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) deserves credit for making the clear distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel\u0026rsquos Government and hostility to Jews. Accepting the IHRA definition, and all 11 of the associated examples, should have been a no-brainer for Corbyn\u0026rsquos Labour.  But some Labour figures believed the IHRA definition would restrict the scope for criticism of Israel and, despite the definition being supported by dozens of countries and organisations, the party\u0027s governing body needlessly offended the Jewish community by watering down some of the eleven examples.  The anti-Semitism row may seem like Corbyn\u0026rsquos problem, but it is also illustrative of the difficulties faced by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard since he succeeded Kezia Dugdale.  Leonard, despite the sneers from people who do not understand Scottish Labour, leads an autonomous party. He can say whatever he wants on reserved matters and can offer his view on whichever drama is consuming internal UK Labour politics.  Given that Labour is reviewing its code of anti-Semitism, Leonard could have led the way in calling for his party to back the full IHRA definition. He could have staked out a distinctive position, which would have reflected the majority in his own Holyrood group and in the wider Scottish party.  Leonard has instead kept quiet about the IHRA row while allowing the Scottish party to put out a defensive statement that backs the UK position. As with Brexit, where he has signed up to the baffling stance adopted by the Westminster Shadow Cabinet, Leonard prioritised unity with Corbyn over acting as the voice of Scottish Labour.  The Central Scotland MSP, eight months into his leadership, has two sizeable problems. One is that a majority of his MSPs \u0026ndash and their staff \u0026ndash do not, and will never, fully support him. Every day is a struggle and his enemies hope he fails.  The second issue is that many of his supporters care more about the Corbyn project than they do about him. Deviating from the UK leadership line is viewed by elements inside Team Leonard as tantamount to helping the Labour Right. For them, Leonard should be a replica Corbyn whose job is to help return Labour MPs.  Johann Lamont\u0026rsquos last call as leader was to warn that Scottish Labour had been treated as a \u0026ldquobranch office by London. Leonard has the power to be his own man, but seems reluctant to walk in his own shoes."},{"url":null,"title":"happy-60th-birthday-nasa-the-past-the-present-and-the-future-of-space-exploration","story":"  Fendell, a specialist in integrated communications at Mission Control in Houston, had, together with his colleagues, watched with pride as Apollo 11\u0026rsquos Lunar Module touched down on the moon\u0026rsquos surface.  \u0026ldquoEventually we did a shift change, Fendell recalls in the documentary, Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo. He went to get something to eat for breakfast and stopped to buy a copy of a newspaper, which was full of news of the landing.  He said: \u0026ldquoI sat down at the counter \u0026hellip Two guys walked in and sat down next to me and one of them said to the other, \u0026lsquoYou know, I landed in Normandy on D-Day \u0026hellip I was never prouder to be an American than yesterday, when we landed on the moon.  Fendell, clearly moved by the memory, goes on to say: \u0026ldquoIt then hit me what we had done.  The Apollo programme is just one of many that have been successfully launched by Nasa, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, over the decades. Sixty years ago today, on July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law, and on October 1 that year, Nasa began operations.  In the years after the Second World War, a space race developed between the Americans and the Soviets. Both sides made steady progress but America was plunged into a crisis on October 4, 1954, when its Communist rival launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite the world had seen.  \u0026ldquoThis had a \u0026lsquoPearl Harbor effect\u0027 on American public opinion, says Nasa\u0026rsquos official history page, \u0026ldquocreating an illusion of a technological gap, and provided the impetus for increased spending for aerospace endeavors, technical and scientific educational programs, and the chartering of new federal agencies to manage air and space research and development.  Nasa had been in operation for a few years when, in May 1961, President John F Kennedy famously asked his country to commit to putting Americans on the moon by the end of the decade. His statement came not long after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man to orbit the Earth. Kennedy, unwilling to see the US fall further behind in the space race, committed huge new sums to Nasa. It\u0026rsquos sometimes forgotten, though, as Nasa points out, that JFK had entered the White House thinking that space could be an area for co-operation with the Soviet Union that would lessen the tension between the two countries. It was a hope he never gave up.  It took Nasa eight years and three programmes \u0026ndash Mercury and Gemini had preceded Apollo \u0026ndash before it was able to meet Kennedy\u0027s dream of putting an American on the moon, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming the first men to leave footprints on the lunar surface, on July 20, 1969.  Pete Conrad and Alan Bean from Apollo 12 followed suit that November (the Command Module commander, Richard Gordon, died last year), but a planned third lunar landing, in 1970, almost ended in disaster when an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft. The crew were all brought back to earth safely.  Nasa\u0026rsquos many other programmes have ranged from robotic missions to Venus, Mars and the outer planets, the Skylab orbital workshop, remote-sensing Earth satellites, aeronautics research and of course the Space Shuttle, the first reusable spacecraft.  This shuttle programme itself suffered two great misfortunes \u0026ndash in 1986, when the main liquid fuel tank on the Challenger orbiter exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing the seven crew members, and in 2003, when the Columbia orbiter disintegrated 15 minutes before landing, killing its seven-strong crew.  It was, however, from the Discovery space shuttle that Nasa launched the Hubble telescope, in April 1990. It has more than lived up to the organisation\u0026rsquos description of it as \u0026ldquothe most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo\u0027s telescope, probing the mysteries of the cosmos and making more than 1.3 million observations as it circles the Earth at some 17,000mph.  Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine has been at pains to remind the public what the organisation has achieved in addition to space exploration.  In a recent speech marking the 60th anniversary, Bridenstine said Nasa had transformed people\u0026rsquos lives by blazing a trail in the way we navigate, communicate, produce food and energy, predict weather and understand the Earth. \"All of these capabilities \u0026ndash that, in many cases, we take for granted as Americans \u0026ndash are available to us because of the trail that Nasa blazed, he said.  Musician will.i.am added: \u0026ldquoA lot of the technology we have today ... wouldn\u0026rsquot have been possible if it wasn\u0026rsquot for a lot of Nasa\u0026rsquos work. A lot of the systems that we use today in our cellphones, if it wasn\u0026rsquot for that [research and development] that Nasa was doing back then, we wouldn\u0026rsquot have what we have today.  Tycoons such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson have invested colossal sums in space adventure. Musk wants to reach Mars by 2020, Bezos believes the Moon can be colonised within a century, and Branson plans to take well-heeled tourists to space next year.  Nasa has its own ambitions, however, saying its future will continue to involve \u0026ldquohuman exploration, technology, and science. It will return to the Moon to try to learn \u0026ldquowhat it will take to support human exploration to Mars and beyond\".  Other priorities include aiding the development of a \u0026ldquovibrant low-Earth orbit economy by building on the successes of the International Space Station, and inventing new technologies to boost air transport at home and meet the challenges of advanced space exploration.  \u0026ldquoOur scientists, it adds, \u0026ldquowill work to increase an understanding of our planet and our place in the universe. We will continue to try to answer the question, \u0027Are we alone?\u0027.\""},{"url":null,"title":"the-decluttering-conundrum-how-modern-life-has-got-in-the-way-of-the-quest-for-order","story":"  But lest we forget amid the summer sunshine, here are some chilling facts. Around 60% of the world\u0027s private consumer spending is done by the 12% of us who live in Western Europe and North America. The average British 10-year-old owns 238 toys yet plays with only 12 of them. A typical UK household has at least eight internet-connected devices. And every year, the army of professionals dedicated to helping us rid our lives of unwanted clutter grows by 10%.  Guilty as all those statistics make me feel, I could do with some professional guidance right now as I attempt to deal with the accumulated detritus of my own household\u0027s consumerist past. So I search the internet, where I learn that there is actually something called the Association of Professional Declutterers and Organisers, that it\u0027s possible to do a specialist training course in how to chuck out other people\u0027s stuff, and that the best advice of all was coined back in 1880 by William Morris, who said: \"Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.\"  But what, I wonder, would the father of the Arts \u0026amp Crafts movement have made of the mess of electronic gubbins I\u0027ve just pulled from the cupboard under the stairs? There are chargers for gadgets I don\u0027t remember owning, software CDs for devices that haven\u0027t worked in years, dozens of unlabelled video cassettes and a diabolical tangle of cables that have somehow become conjoined.  None of it is beautiful. The fact these objects have been unmissed for years would suggest they long ago outlived their usefulness. And yet \u0026hellip What if, somewhere amidst that technological morass, there lies the key to unlocking one of the umpteen outdated gadgets currently doing time in my loft? Up there among the bat droppings there are cameras that just might contain precious photographs. There are old PCs containing jottings that may one day be hailed as literary gems. There are broken vacuum cleaners that could conceivably be repaired, inkjet printers that came home with the laundry from various student flats, and VCRs I can\u0027t throw out in case one of the unlabelled video cassettes turns out to contain lost footage from my children\u0027s infancy.  Clearly, I am suffering from a bad case of disposophobia \u0026ndash fear of getting rid of stuff and then regretting it. Then again, \u0026ldquousefulness is a stretchable term and William Morris \u0026ndash who was speaking at a time when homes didn\u0027t even have electric sockets \u0026ndash could never have envisaged a society in which many people change their phones every year.  According to United Nations environmentalists, discarded electronic goods constitute the world\u0027s fastest-growing waste problem. Each year in the UK, the average person throws away 20-25kg of gadgets such as laptops, fridges, TVs and phones and in 2016 alone, some 43 million tonnes of electronic refuse were disposed of worldwide.  Hoarders like me may kid ourselves we\u0027re not adding to the tech mountain but, deep down, we know we are simply delaying the inevitable and that sooner or later, all that metal and plastic will have to come down from the loft. We could, of course, simply leave the excavation to our beneficiaries, by which time those old printers and vacuum cleaners may have acquired a veneer of vintage charm as offbeat coffee tables or lamp stands. But it appears that leaving your offspring to deal with your stuff is the height of bad manners in the 21st century, thanks to the growing popularity of the gloomy-sounding cult of Swedish death-cleaning.  Touted as \u0026ldquothe new hygge, this Scandinavian trend was introduced to the UK by Margareta Magnusson, author of The Gentle Art Of Swedish Death Cleaning. Offering tips on \u0026ldquoremoving unnecessary things and making your home nice and orderly when you think the time is coming closer for you to leave the planet, the book is the latest in a long line of clutter-clearing manuals.  I\u0027m not sure about Magnusson\u0027s exhortation that we \u0026ldquoreally must death-clean in order to \u0026ldquosave precious time for our loved ones after we have gone. People who have led useful lives and raised families are surely entitled to expect their descendants to make a little effort on their behalf and it\u0027s distressing to think of people feeling the need to disappear without trace \u0026ndash the ultimate exercise in \u0026ldquonot being a burden.  But she is undoubtedly right that getting rid of superfluous possessions helps people of any age to \u0026ldquolive in the moment and focus on what really matters. There\u0027s plenty of evidence that being surrounded by mess is bad for your mental health and psychologists say it interferes with our ability to make decisions \u0026ndash including, ironically, about what to do with all that stuff.  The long-term answer is, of course, to stop buying things and for manufacturers to be legally prevented from deliberately designing products with a limited lifespan, but in the meantime we still need to deal with the legacy of our past profligacy and Magnusson\u0027s suggestion that readers invite friends and family round to take what they want certainly beats dumping your cast-offs in landfill. \u0026ldquoTo know something will be well used and have a new home is a joy, she writes, adding that handing things on while you are still around lets you pass on some of the memories that are attached to the objects.  I love this idea but sadly it won\u0027t work for defunct old VCRs, which no-one\u0027s going to want, however much I regale them with happy tales of family video nights past watching The Best Of Tom \u0026amp Jerry on the loop. Nor is there any hope of persuading anyone to take over that other domestic bugbear, clearing out the bureaucratic bumph, which for many people remains a major source of anxiety, even in this supposedly paperless internet era.  In our house, there are three key places where piles of correspondence accumulate. There\u0027s the top of the radiator beside the front door, where boring looking letters gather dust, unopened. There\u0027s the hall table, where envelopes that just might contain cheques, tax rebates or the like get opened, then abandoned after the disappointing truth emerges. And there\u0027s the kitchen table, where stuff that urgently needs dealt with gets placed and then ignored.  When visitors are expected, those piles get swept into drawers or sometimes shoe boxes along with a mental note as to their whereabouts that immediately gets forgotten amid the frenzied business of creating a veneer of domestic orderliness.  And there they remain for months, sometimes years on end, until another attempt at home rationalisation brings them to light.  So what to do with them? According to the website of data security company Data Shield, \u0026ldquotrashcans full of old documents could potentially be a gold mine for identity thieves. They recommend shredding bank statements immediately, although Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert advises keeping them for at least six years, in case you need to back up mis-selling claims.  Confused? Me too, but I\u0027m also fed up with the amount of space those documents take up, particularly now that contactless payments mean each statement consists of several pages worth of bus fares, postage stamps and pound-store purchases. Even those who embrace online banking need to deal with the pre-digital backlog \u0026ndash which in my case, dates well into the last millennium. So can I just chuck it all in the recycling bin, I ask data protection consultant Daradjeet Jagpal, director of the Glasgow-based Information Law Solutions Limited? Apparently not.  \u0026ldquoWhen recycling bins were first introduced by local authorities, he tells me, \u0026ldquopeople were putting junk mail and even old bank statements in with their newspapers and magazines, thinking they\u0027d be shredded or otherwise destroyed. Unfortunately they didn\u0027t realise there were people who would go up to recycling bins during the night, and see what they could find.  Identity thieves, he says, are always one step ahead and bank statements need to be shredded, though even then: \u0026ldquoPeople who perpetrate these crimes are savvy and sometimes they take the shreds and join them together to create an image they can then use for their illegitimate purposes.  Since burning your papers may breach local environmental laws, he recommends using cross-cut shredders (which are safer but dearer than older models) or a professional shredding service. Can you, I ask, get away with removing your contact details and account numbers from the statements and recycle the rest? Jagpal sees no problem with this and is sanguine about energy bills going in the bin, though he warns phone bills which show other people\u0027s telephone numbers could potentially compromise their security too, and that old passports and driving licence documents must always be securely disposed of.  What about computers, I ask, thinking about the decrepit contraptions in my loft. Again, advises Jagpal, these should be disposed of carefully since even if they don\u0027t work, savvy thieves can read your hard drive and steal your data \u0026ndash with or without your passwords. If the machine still functions and you want to recycle it (which you really should), he suggests approaching a reputable company or charity that will certify that your data has been securely wiped.  If you must bin the machines, he recommends \u0026ldquoputting a hammer and chisel through the hard drive though points out that data protection legislation requires more stringent methods of corporate bodies.  All of which sounds very sensible but doesn\u0027t cure my disposophobia and although I briefly consider buying a cross-cut shredder (which can be bought online for less than \u0026pound20), I realise it would eventually end up joining all those inkjet printers in the loft.  So I opt, instead, for a low-tech solution. Phone bills, energy bills and dental check-up reminders get recklessly recycle-binned. Some yawn-inducing pension stuff gets relegated to the kitchen-table pending pile, along with car tax reminders and anything else that might result in a jail sentence if ignored.  Next, I start on the bank statements, beginning by cutting off the bits containing those risky personal details. Twenty minutes in, however, bored rigid and with 10,000 unexpurgated sheets to go, I throw the whole lot into a large box along with the electronic gubbins and squash it into the cupboard under the stairs.  It may be useful it may even be beautiful, in a surreal kind of way \u0026ndash but death cleaning can wait until I\u0027m dead. And if anyone wants to steal my identity after I\u0027ve gone, they\u0027re welcome to it.

It fails to answer the specific needs of our country. While it is welcome that the paper confirms the UK\u0026rsquos commitment to visa-free travel for EU visitors, which would be reassuring for Scotland\u0026rsquos tourism industry, there are still far too many unknowns about future UK immigration policy.  The earlier UK statement of intent on the EU settlement scheme aims to reassure EU citizens who want to enter and stay in the UK during the transition period. However, this delayed announcement didn\u0026rsquot take us much further forward either. The Scottish Government doesn\u0026rsquot believe it is right that the UK Government plans to make EU citizens pay a fee to continue to live in the UK, when EU citizens in the UK have entered freely with the right to remain and many have built their lives here. And it is totally unacceptable that we still have no meaningful indication from the UK government about what future system the UK plans to put in place if free movement does indeed come to an end after Brexit.  We believe it is now time for the Home Secretary to go a step further and remove the net migration target altogether. The UK Government\u0026rsquos arbitrary, unworkable commitment to reduce net migration to the UK to the \"tens of thousands\" has misguidedly driven UK policy decisions on immigration for the last eight years. It\u0026rsquos insensitive, unhelpful, inflexible and the exact opposite of what Scotland needs.  Scotland\u0027s population is ageing. Over the next 25 years, projections from the National Records of Scotland show that the pension age population will increase by 25 per cent, with the number of those aged 75 and over set to increase by almost 80 per cent. While there is an overall ageing population in many countries, the key difference in Scotland is that our working-age population is projected to grow by only one per cent and is even projected to decline if migration is reduced. In order to prevent adverse impacts on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic growth, it is vital that we continue to attract people to live and work in Scotland, with all levels of skills and experience and on both a short-term and a long-term basis.  These figures clearly show how vital migration is to Scotland and also help explain why the negative impact of reduced migration on Scottish GDP is set to be proportionally worse than in the rest of the UK. As things stand, Scotland will lose \u0026pound5 billion a year by 2040, 4.5 per cent of Scottish GDP, through reduced growth as a result of the known impacts of Brexit leading to lower levels of migration. The rest of the UK will lose out as well, with GDP growth set to be 3.7 per cent lower than it otherwise would have been. That difference is equivalent to an extra impact of \u0026pound1.2 billion in Scotland. The situation would be even worse if the UK ever managed to meet its net migration target. In that scenario, where net migration to the UK was reduced to \"tens of thousands\", Scotland would lose over \u0026pound10 billion per year in GDP by 2040.  These are only some of the important reasons why we believe that there is an urgent need for a tailored approach to migration for Scotland. The Scottish Government discussion paper on migration, published earlier this year, sets out how the UK approach to migration is damaging Scotland and how a different Scotland-specific approach, with new powers for the Scottish Parliament, could significantly benefit all of Scotland. Public sentiment is increasingly recognising the harmful impact that UK policies are having on the lives of hard-working people \u0026ndash people who want to help strengthen our economy, enrich our society and, in many cases, build their lives with their families here.  The long-awaited UK White Paper simply doesn\u0026rsquot provide the much-needed reassurance that so many in Scotland wanted. There is still an opportunity in these final few months of negotiations for the UK to adopt the sensible position of remaining within the Single Market and the Custom Union, to mitigate some of the damage that Brexit will do. The Scottish Government will continue to make that case and to argue for much greater engagement from the UK Government to protect Scotland\u0027s interests.

The musician, better known for his indie band moniker Conquering Animal Sound, has recorded an album of songs inspired by the events around, and since, the city\u0026rsquos feelgood summer of 1988.  The five-month jamboree of arts and horticulture drew five million folk to a 100-acre patch of post-industrial brownfield on the south bank of the Clyde that had been repurposed as a verdant playground blooming with optimism.  Trams ran the length of the cobbled promenade, a beach and a forest were created at the Govan basin, and the docks became a playground for musicians and artists.  A Japanese garden, miniature railway, Art Deco milk bar and a huge floral crest celebrating the centenary of Celtic FC feature in many a photo album of those who visited the site in a summer when the riverside thrilled with screams from the Coca-Cola rollercoaster.  The festival, which was the third of its kind in the UK and lasted just 153 days, is fondly held in the collective memory of the city\u0026rsquos people, thousands of whom would consider the \u0026pound15 forked out for a season ticket to be among the best money they ever spent.  Yet the physical evidence that it even happened is scant.  The Bell\u0026rsquos Bridge, the uninspiring Festival Park and a now-obscured mural on the gable end of a block of flats are the only nods to an event which generated millions for the city.  It was while delivering mail as a postman on the streets of Govan that 30-year-old Scott was inspired to examine the cultural memory of the expo.  \u0026ldquoI went into a block of flats on the former site of the festival and up the stairs there\u0026rsquos the logo from the Garden Festival, says Scott. \u0026ldquoMy initial thought was that it would look good on a T-shirt, because it was really colourful and inspiring. Then I had the idea for an album about it and the more the whole thing went on the more we started to do, so we decided to recreate the festival at the Glad Cafe.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a marker of its 30th anniversary, but it felt like there was an intrinsic link to it, because of the way I stumbled across this thing that happened in the summer I was born.  Despite being born in Inverness midway through the festival\u0026rsquos run, and raised in the Trossachs, Glasgow-based Scott has come to understand the significance of the part it played in recovering some of the pride the city lost as the industries that made its name were dismantled in the 1980s.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a line you can draw from the Garden Festival to the European City of Culture in 1990, through to the Glasgow Miracle [a term coined by German art curator Hans Ulrich Obrist in response to the number of Turner Prize nominated artists in the city] and the explosion of the indie music scene, he says.  \u0026ldquoI was living in Govan when I first had the idea, and there aren\u0026rsquot really any markers to the festival in the area. There\u0026rsquos the Festival Business Park which has a logo on the wall which has been obscured, and festival park.  Working with a collective of artists and designers, Scott has conceived Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, a live time-portal which will include designer Roy Shearer\u0026rsquos accessible scale model of the Clydesdale Bank 150 Anniversary Tower, one of the festival\u0026rsquos most popular attractions, as well as replica T-shirts, merchandise and immersive tours using virtual reality headsets to turn the clock back three decades.  Yet the purpose is more than providing the mere novelty of nostalgia.  He says: \u0026ldquoFrom what I\u0026rsquove read about the Garden Festival, people were overwhelmingly positive about it. People talked about never having seen anything like it in Glasgow before, they spoke about how it felt like the city had come together. Glaswegians were on the same page, seeing their city in a different light, which I think is really important.  The event, to be held on August 11, will feature the work of visual artist David Lemm who will contribute a series of illustrations based on some of the artwork around the site in contrast to its current appearance as an avenue of grey boxes, described recently by artist Lachlan Goudie as \u0026ldquobits of space junk.  Virtual reality artist James Houston will use archive footage shot during the festival to create an immersive experience enabling people to stroll through the site\u0026rsquos walkways wearing virtual reality headsets. Independent clothing label 2 Stripe, which specialises in reviving forgotten Scottish corporate iconography of the 1980s and 90s, will sell the T-shirts featuring the flower spray logo, which was the brainchild of Shona Maciver, of Glasgow design firm Locofoco.  \u0026ldquoApparently they sold something like 25,000 of those T-shirts, says Scott. \u0026ldquoWho knows how many of them are still out there.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove taken a few of the markers of the festival. The tower was removed almost as soon as it was over, and now stands in Rhyl, in Wales. There was no tower in Glasgow for many years until the tower at the Science Centre, and that was shut for a long time.  \u0026ldquoI think being able to go up and see a city from above is actually really important for its people \u0026ndash to see your own space, but also being able to see beyond it. It\u0026rsquos part of defining what your city is.  \u0026ldquoSo we decided to build a tower in the Glad Cafe and project archive footage of what people saw when they went up there, a skyline of Glasgow which doesn\u0026rsquot exist anymore, and this incredible festival going on below them.  \u0026ldquoOne of the things people remember about it most is that it was a nice summer, and we\u0026rsquore having the same kind of summer again 30 years later.  The gig will also feature Scott debuting the songs on the album Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, which include references to the city\u0026rsquos ascendant music scene of the late 1980s.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a song on the album called (Don\u0026rsquot You) Forget About Me, which is a totally different song from the Simple Minds one, and is really about the fact that the Garden Festival should be remembered. There\u0026rsquos also a reference to Tinseltown In The Rain by The Blue Nile. I think it\u0026rsquos important to recall what was going on with the music coming out of the city at the time.  One of the key themes behind the project is encapsulated in the song The Paper Boat, a reference to the art installation of the late Inverclyde artist George Wyllie, famed for his sculptures and artworks inspired by heavy industry along the Clyde. Both the river\u0026rsquos industry, and its garden festival, are now virtually gone.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a song about the decline of shipbuilding on the river, and a reference to George Wyllie\u0026rsquos Paper Boat, says the singer. \u0026ldquoSome of his artworks were at the festival, and though the Paper Boat wasn\u0026rsquot part of that, the song is a link to the fact that they worked with some of the former shipbuilders in the creative design of the festival.  \u0026ldquoWyllie\u0026rsquos take on the shipbuilding industry wasn\u0026rsquot just about people losing their jobs and their livelihoods, it was about the creative energies and the skills they had which gave them a sense of wellbeing. Losing the shipyards was about those people losing their creative energies.  It\u0026rsquos a desire to reflect the toils of the city\u0026rsquos forefathers which have led Jamie Scott to employ his own creative energies in tribute to theirs.  \u0026ldquoThey discovered the Floating Head from the festival sitting in a yard down the Clyde a few years ago, he says of another memorable installation, a head the size of a boat designed by Richard Groom, which floated on the river. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos crazy to think there\u0026rsquos really nothing to mark it. Some of the artwork could still be accommodated on the site.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something which has completely disappeared and yet is so fondly remembered. This is our way of doing that, and maybe others will, too.  Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, The Glad Cafe, August 11. For tickets visit: www.thegladcafe/events  30 YEARS ON: FESTIVAL FACTFILE  IT drew almost five million people to the south bank of the Clyde, and led to a reported injection of \u0026pound100 million for the local economy with the council pledging a further \u0026pound170 million in the five years after.  The Glasgow Garden Festival was the first international expo to be held in Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest city since the Empire Exhibition in 1938.  Visitors were 40 per cent higher than expected at the 1988 celebration on the Prince\u0026rsquos Dock, living up to its slogan, \u0026ldquoA day out of this world.  And while little of it remains by way of physical touchstone, its impact on the city\u0026rsquos cultural confidence and reputation is unmistakable.  Within two years of being awarded the Garden Festival in 1984, Glasgow was named as the European Capital of Culture for 1990.  Some would argue that a line can be drawn from the Garden Festival through to this summer\u0026rsquos European Championships, with 1999\u0026rsquos City of Architecture and Design and 2014\u0026rsquos Commonwealth Games maintaining the momentum.  This year, the RSPB launched a Glasgow Wildlife Garden Festival to mark the 30th anniversary, with pop-up gardening events planned on Glasgow Green as part of next month\u0026rsquos Festival 2018 cultural accompaniment to the European Championships. A conference aimed at fifth and sixth year school pupils on the future of Glasgow\u0026rsquos green spaces is also due to be held at the city\u0026rsquos Science Centre on the former festival site. Today, the Science Centre is the only public attraction on the 120-acre footprint.  Initial plans for an ambitious housing development fell through after a downturn in the housing market in the late 1980s, and most of the site lay derelict for years.  In 2001, the Glasgow Tower opened, hailed as the tallest free-standing fully rotational structure in the world. It suffered from a series of malfunctions in the years after its completion.  The festival site is now home to a row of colourless offices and hotels, with the premises of broadcasters STV and BBC Scotland occupying the area.  Some of its attractions and installations were broken up and distributed near and far. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was sold for \u0026pound400,000 and now stands in Rhyl.  The Big Yellow Kettle became a tourist information office in Gourock, Inverclyde, before being dismantled. Nearby Cardwell Garden Centre is home to a variety of structures and plants from the festival, bought up by then owner Eric Gallagher.

What then transpired was a soul-chilling insight into how grotesque wealth often has a Uri Geller-like effect upon one\u0026rsquos moral compass.  After casually querying the viability of keeping brains alive in jars, one of the group \u0026ndash a major brokerage firm\u0026rsquos CEO \u0026ndash then proudly informed the professor he\u0026rsquod recently built an extensive \u0026ldquounderground bunker system. So far, so Robbie Williams. However, it was the next question which caused the hairs on the back of Rushkoff\u0026rsquos neck to rise: \u0026ldquoHow do I maintain authority over my security force after the Event?  This \u0026ldquoEvent, of course, refers to the apparently inevitable and imminent downfall of civilised society \u0026ndash envisioned simply as a complete breakdown in the laws governing our lives which maintain the fantasy of societal order. With capitalism\u0026rsquos illusion presently flickering like a cheap lamp in a thunderstorm, Professor Rushkoff\u0026rsquos account of the paranoid psyches of the super-rich is as deeply disturbing as it is enlightening.  With risk assessment a vital tool of success within the entrepreneurial sharkpool, we should perhaps not be surprised that these five individuals didn\u0026rsquot actually need a solution from Rushkoff on how to maintain control of their private armies. The question was purely rhetorical. Such post-Event plans seem to have already been drawn up \u0026ndash with these billionaires suggesting either advanced-AI security robots or special combination locks on the food supply could keep their biological minions subservient. There\u0026rsquoll certainly a risk of mutiny when they realise wages are worthless in a post-apocalyptic world.  Ironically, by expressing such an acute fear of losing control, these \u0026lsquoone percenters\u0026rsquo show they have feelings just like you or I \u0026ndash albeit ones fuelled by sociopathy and self-preservation. So whether the apocalypse arrives upon the wings of nuclear war, an uncurable virus, environmental catastrophe or self-aware Artificial Intelligence, Rushkoff\u0026rsquos meeting has not only confirmed that humanity\u0026rsquos upper echelons are well aware their privileged social standing will mean nothing once money is meaningless \u0026ndash but also that they actually plan on keeping their hard-won elite status after the \u0026lsquoEvent\u0026rsquo.  This coldly tyrannical mindset was certainly responsible for the casual manner by which the next potential method of control was discussed \u0026ndash the possible post-Event application of an electronic collar device that deep south plantation owners would have seen as indistinguishable from magic. These would, presumably, administer a nasty blast of voltage to punish acts of insubordination.  But surely such a heinous instrument of control would never be put into production in a civilized modern society? Well, you can actually buy one off eBay right now for a tenner. Of course, such devices can only be used for disciplining naughty dogs at present, but it looks likely our own societal masters might be liberal enough not to discriminate between species.  HAD YOUR FILL OF BREXIT?  TALKING of apocalyptic scenarios, it seems doomed Tory patsy Dominic Raab has slipped into the role of Brexit Secretary as comfortably as Vegas Elvis\u0026rsquo swollen, gout-ridden feet did into his old blue suede shoes.  By announcing he\u0026rsquoll ensure adequate food supplies in the event of a \u0026ldquono deal divorce, Raab has inadvertently smashed the emergency alarm glass, alerting us to the Government\u0026rsquos acceptance of such a nightmarish endgame. It\u0026rsquos also likely this \u0026ldquoadequate stockpile describes the countless jars of Nutella and pesto crammed into his own cupboards at home. Perhaps he\u0026rsquoll soon be chastising starving children for not having the \u0026ldquoBlitz spirit.  Speaking selfishly, it would be good to have some clarity from Mr Raab on the legalities of cannibalism in the event of \u0026ldquono deal. I personally know one fella whom I suspect would be particularly flavoursome, having survived on a diet of ciggies and apple cider for much of his life.  Yet, despite cannibalism likely to be legalised before cannabis in the UK, perhaps we should first consider the facts behind the UK\u0026rsquos food imports before choosing which of our children we love the least.  It\u0026rsquos a fact that around half of all our food actually originates here \u0026ndash so the obvious solution is to simply ban sex and wait a few decades for half the population to die. No-one will have the energy for rumpo anyway on a diet of radioactive oxygen and tree bark.  Yet, it may be vital that we continue to bump uglies \u0026ndash the friction between two malnourished human pelvises may be the only means of sparking a fire once the lights go out.  CASHING IN AT THE END OF THE WORLD  IF you\u0026rsquore too skint or lazy to build your own doomsday bunker, take comfort in the fact that death is certain to be an agonisingly prolonged experience for world leaders and politicians who survive the \u0026ldquoEvent.  With nothing but tinned food, water and \u0026ndash one assumes \u0026ndash stockpiles of hairspray and St Tropez to keep them occupied, madness will overcome our newly-impotent rulers long before the bravery to surface does.  Unless, that is, they\u0026rsquove gone to ground in China, where a recently constructed underground complex is so spacious and accommodating that much of the populace will surely find conditions preferable to the toxic smog hellscape on the surface. Built 2,000 metres below ground in Beijing, the new city-sized complex apparently has space for at least one million people \u0026ndash with supplies that can last years, if necessary.  And unlike Western billionaires, President Xi Jinping won\u0026rsquot have to worry about mutiny over worthless wages within the ranks of his army, being communists and all. Already, the Chinese military proudly refer to the complex as the \u0026ldquobrain of the People\u0026rsquos Liberation Army, which will clearly remain the world\u0026rsquos largest fighting force post-apocalypse. Learn Mandarin now, kids.  It certainly puts the scale of a new commercial bunker complex recently completed in South Dakota into perspective, where Californian firm Vivos has identified a thriving market in end-time paranoia. Their underground tomb will host 10,000 customers who stump up a \u0026pound18,000 fee. Surely, however, Vivos knows all that cash will be worthless post-Event.  It\u0026rsquos almost as if they don\u0026rsquot expect the apocalypse to happen at all.  RELY ON NATURE WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS  SAM Cooke once ably informed us all that a change is gonna come, but it\u0026rsquos unlikely he meant a post-apocalyptic evolutionary adaption that will allow us to exist without eating. Or maybe he did, influenced perhaps by those Californian cultists that claim to survive on sunlight and good vibes alone.  So fear not if you can\u0026rsquot afford a bunker to sit out Armageddon \u0026ndash Japanese biologists agree with Sam that a change is, well, possible. If we have the patience to wait for a miraculous gene mutation which presently only takes place within the bodies of the sea-snail Gigantopelta chessoia.  Spending much of its life hanging around ocean hydrothermal vents, this wee creature\u0026rsquos digestive tract was found to completely cease functioning upon reaching physical maturity \u0026ndash with a mysterious gland that once acted as its food pipe increasing as dramatically as human teenagers\u0026rsquo hate for their parents.  This new organ then invites nearby bacteria to move in and carry out all the body\u0026rsquos energy conversion \u0026ndash allowing the snail to survive without ever eating food again. This astonishing feat is apparently fuelled by a bacteria-energising compound called hydrogen sulfide, which is abundant in ocean hydrothermal vents.  As the snail no longer needs to feed, the balance of the entire ecosystem changes \u0026ndash which, for humanity, would usher in a new Eden without abattoirs, fast food conglomerates or James Martin roadshows. Finding hydrothermal vents on dry land may prove challenging, but note that hydrogen sulphide is also richly abundant within human faeces \u0026ndash yet another way Brexit could leave us deep in the s***."},{"url":null,"title":"cornerstone launch town centre project","story":"        The wraps have come off an impressive new Peterhead hub for a Scottish charity.

Following its March launch at Mackie’s of Scotland’s 19.2 parlour, fans had been going nutty for the ever-flowing tap, consuming more than 5kg in the first week.                                                    But the Aberdeen parlour has now said goodbye to the dessert topper – which was being outperformed by its neighbouring ever-flowing chocolate tap, dispensing Mackie’s own milk chocolate – made just 19.2 miles away on the family farm.                                                    Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.                                                                                                        Although the departure of the tap will come as sad news for many nut butter lovers, those looking for a new topping for their desserts won’t have to wait too long, as Mackie’s is close to finalising the tap’s replacement flavour.Yvette added: “I don’t want to give too much away just yet, but for many this will be a taste of their childhood and an all-round favourite for waffles, crepes and sundae scoops.“The new tap could well be ready to go in the next week so make sure you head down to the parlour and be one of the first to try our new creation.”In addition to the success of the taps, Mackie’s is also on course for their most successful summer of sales ever.

The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting.

The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 28, 2018 at 6:15 pmOrkney are revelling tonight after a dream senior inter-county double win over Shetland.

He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaSunday 29 Jul 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

In doing so we create a ‘pure play’ aviation services business that operates in a structural growth market and is very well-placed to take advantage of the many exciting opportunities that exist.”Upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to shareholder approval and expected to complete in September, Forsyth Black, currently president and managing director of Menzies Aviation, will be appointed chief executive of John Menzies and will be supported by Giles Wilson, chief financial officer and John Geddes, group company secretary and corporate affairs director.Smurfit added: “In his role as Menzies CEO, Forsyth Black will now focus on growing our market share in the aviation services market, increasing our operating margins and continuing to deliver excellent services to our customers.”The firm is set to report its interim results on 14 August."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775278.1532777806!/image/image.jpg","title":"mass indyref2 rally set to take place on streets of inverness","story":"        A mass rally in support of Scottish independence is to go ahead in Inverness this afternoon.

There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris? A playing field you are comfortable in and very newsworthy to boot.            READ MORE: Two thirds of young Scots believe Brexit will be ‘bad’But, if we can just get back to the main plot. The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia. I hear the weather is a lot cooler there."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775407.1532846296!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon urged to back people s vote ahead of indyref2","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon has been urged to put the national interest ahead of the SNP\u0026#8217s drive for independence and support a People\u0026#8217s Vote on the Brexit deal.                The plea was made by Labour MP Ian Murray in a letter to the First Minister in which he argues that her support could be pivotal when it comes to securing a People’s Vote.            Murray, a prominent Remainer and member of Scottish Labour for the Single Market, said there was now a “very real risk” of a “no-deal” Brexit, an outcome that would have “catastrophic consequences”.            In his letter, he called on Sturgeon to encourage the SNP membership to back a referendum on the EU withdrawal deal.He said: “Your support would have a significant impact and could be pivotal in securing a vote on the Brexit deal. The SNP will hold its annual conference this autumn and I would also urge you to consider encouraging your membership to send a message of support for a People’s Vote.”Murray alluded to SNP reluctance to support another referendum because of the precedent it would set when it comes to Scottish independence.Having another vote on the Brexit deal would give ammunition to unionists who would want to revisit a vote for Scottish independence .“I am aware of concerns within the SNP of the impact of a People’s Vote on your campaign for Scottish independence, but I call on you to put the national interest ahead of your party’s interest. You were elected to represent all the people of Scotland, who voted overwhelmingly for Remain, not just the minority of people who support Scottish independence.             “The outcome of the Brexit negotiations will affect Scotland and the UK for generations to come. Because this is so important for our country’s future, I hope you will join the campaign for a People’s Vote.” A spokesman for the \u2028First Minister said: “It is not the SNP who are standing in the way of a second EU referendum – Ian Murray’s time would be better spent persuading his own Labour colleagues to back him, as currently they are signed up to a hard Brexit which will be devastating for jobs and living standards in Scotland.”The spokesman added that Scotland’s Remain vote had been ignored by the UK government and by Labour."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a new fellowship of the rings is born","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nUNTIL\n three months ago, local environmental champion Aidan Crean had never seen a barn owl – which is why he looks so ecstatic this week in this photograph.\n\nAidan is holding a baby owl in what was the culmination of a project that is breathing new life into the fortunes of this spectacular and incredibly rare bird. \n\nA pair of barn owls – scréachóg reilige in Irish, meaning screecher of the graveyard – were found to be nesting in a derelict cottage on the shores of Lough Neagh, and – watched round the clock by another great West Belfast nature lover known to bloggers as Antrim Lens – the parents produced a record haul of five chicks. And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
