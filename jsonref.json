It is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, which William will inherit when Charles becomes King. Then William will be his father\u0027s landlord, taking £700,000 a year rent.In London, Charles\u0027s official Clarence House residence was originally earmarked for Harry but his departure to California means that is \u0027no longer on the cards\u0027.It is now more likely to be saved for Prince George, Princess Charlotte or Prince Louis, although its outdated decor is a turn-off for younger Royals. A source said: \u0027No one is terribly fond of Clarence House because it\u0027s still seen very much as the Queen Mother\u0027s place.\u0027Charles intends to keep another of his grandmother\u0027s properties – Birkhall in Scotland, which he inherited on her death in 2002 and one of the few places where he is said to feel at home. It is part of the Balmoral Estate, the Queen\u0027s favourite residence. Balmoral\u0027s grounds and gardens are closed to the public in the summer when she is in residence but under Charles, there is set to be far greater access. A source said: \u0027The talk is of opening a museum paying tribute to the Queen.\u0027Even Sandringham in Norfolk, which is privately owned by the Royal Family, might be opened up to the public when Charles inherits it. Wood Farm, the cottage in the grounds where Prince Philip spent his latter years, could be mothballed for future generations.The Cambridges look set to keep Anmer Hall, the nearby mansion which the Queen gave them after their 2011 wedding and also stand to inherit Llwynywermod, the Welsh home of the Prince of Wales."},{"url":null,"title":"175k collectible James Bond coin solid gold raffled just 5 ticket","story":"Share this article Since tickets became available last week more than 1,000 have already been snapped up by people desperate to get their hands on the rare item.The two-kilo coin is currently in secure storage at a secret location.To find out more visit britanniacoincompany.comjames-bond-2-kilo-gold-coin-raffle.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Dog Bounty Hunter wades waist deep Florida swamp waters hunt Brian Laundrie","story":"Share this articleTime and environmental factors are complicating the search for Brian Laundrie, experts say - CNNFox News news \u0026amp latest pictures from Newsweek.comDog the Bounty Hunter working to confirm tip on Brian Laundrie"},{"url":null,"title":"From Claudia Schiffer Shakira rich famous faces caught Pandora Papers leak","story":"Share this articleOffshore havens and hidden riches of world leaders and billionaires exposed in unprecedented leak - ICIJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Traffic light scrapped travel rules simplified","story":"Share this article The Department for Transport said the Government \u0027aims to have it in place for when people return from half-term breaks\u0027.It comes as strict Covid travel restrictions are expected to be lifted on most countries this week including South Africa , Mexico and Brazil .The Government\u0027s \u0027red list\u0027 of 54 countries is tipped to be reduced to just nine, just in time for families travelling during the half-term break. Countries such as Cape Verde and Indonesia are also due to be released from the red list, which requires travellers to quarantine in hotels.Thailand could also be removed, but sources said this was more of a borderline case.The changes would allow fully-vaccinated people to visit these countries without having to self-isolate on their return.The announcement is expected on Thursday as the government looks to return society to normal and boost the economy.The move would lead to a flurry in bookings by holidaymakers, as many on the list are winter sun destinations.It follows lobbying by Tory backbenchers and industry bodies, which said the draconian restrictions were strangling businesses.In the summer, Theresa May warned that Britain was \u0027falling behind the rest of Europe in our decisions to open up\u0027.Scientists have been pleasantly surprised that Covid hospitalisation rates appeared to have plateaued this month at 600 rather than the predicted 7,000.A Whitehall source told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027We are expecting sharp reductions in the red list.

While I welcome any jobs being created anywhere in this country, it\u0027s a great thing for our economy, it doesn\u0027t actually answer the question.\u0027Mr Berry warned about inflation pressures, noting \u0027if your wage isn\u0027t going up at the same time as prices are going up, you\u0027re getting poorer aren\u0027t you?\u0027He said: \u0027The GDP per capita difference between the South East and the poorest areas of the North is greater than between East and West Germany before the Berlin Wall fell down, so absolutely we want to see wages going up.\u0027But if wages are going up at the same time as prices are going up, I think the Chancellor said yesterday inflation kept him up at night, I\u0027m sure it keeps loads of families up at night who are managing their budget, then it will only work if the salary for all jobs goes up... if your wage isn\u0027t going up at the same time as prices are going up, you\u0027re getting poorer aren\u0027t you?\u0027Mr Berry argued that levelling up had to tackle the \u0027huge disparity between the North and the South\u0027.He said: \u0027If you\u0027re born in the north of England you will probably leave school with one GCSE grade worse, you\u0027ll have a lower income throughout your life and statistically you\u0027ll have worse health outcomes and I think that shows what living in London and the South East is a privilege for many, I know many of them won\u0027t feel like that.\u0027The MP added: \u0027I think if levelling up is going to work, we need to end that huge disparity between the North and the South.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"China flies 52 aircraft Taiwans airspace largest mission ever","story":"Share this articleRecord number of PLA warplanes flying over Taiwan Straits as form of National Day ‘military parade’: Global Times editorial - Global Times"},{"url":null,"title":"New culture secretary Nadine Dorries says BBC not EXIST decade","story":"Share this article She said there was a \u0027groupthink\u0027 at the corporation which \u0027excludes working-class backgrounds\u0027.\u0027North West, North East, Yorkshire - if you have got a regional accent in the BBC it doesn\u0027t go down particularly well,\u0027 she said.\u0027They talk about lots to do with ersity but they don\u0027t talk about kids from working-class backgrounds and that\u0027s got to change.\u0027Asked how to address that, she said: \u0027It\u0027s not about quotas, it\u0027s just about having a more fair approach and a less elitist and a less snobbish approach as to who works for you.\u0027Ms Dorries told the event the path from a poor background to the top of a career in the arts or media had \u0027completely disappeared\u0027.\u0027People I went to school with, from my background - I borrowed shoes to go to school, and people I went to school, who had done exactly the same thing - one of them went on to be Cher\u0027s music producer, another one went on to be a very well-known TV broadcaster.\u0027People from my background wrote books, wrote theatre plays and did really well.\u0027If you want to do that today you need a double-barrelled name, you need to have gone to a private or a public school or your mum needs to know someone, or your dad needs to know someone, or you need to have a connection at the BBC.\u0027She added: \u0027Levelling up isn\u0027t about regional growth figures, it\u0027s not about connectivity, it\u0027s about none of that, it\u0027s about people.\u0027The people it\u0027s about the most are people who come from a background like mine who want to be the next Grand Slam champion but can\u0027t afford the private tennis lessons who want to be the next Daisy Edgar-Jones but their mum or dad aren\u0027t head of entertainment at Sky or they want to be Benedict Cumberbatch but they don\u0027t go to private school.\u0027I want to go back to those kids and find them a pathway into the industry.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook shares sink 5 whistleblower claims","story":"Share this article\u0027We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\u0027Facebook head of global affairs Nick Clegg, appearing on CNN Sunday morning, also called the allegations that the social media giant is responsible for the Capitol riot \u0027ludicrous.\u0027 \u0027The responsibility for the violence on January the 6th and the insurrection on that day lies squarely with the people who inflicted the violence and those who encouraged them, including then-President Trump and candidly many other people in the media who were encouraging the assertion that the election was stolen,\u0027 he said. Meanwhile, a congressional panel will hear Haugen\u0027s testimony on Tuesday.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is a member of the panel, told the Washington Post that the SEC should take Haugen\u0027s allegations that Facebook may have mislead investors \u0027very seriously\u0027. \u0027Facebook certainly misled and deceived the public, and so their investors may well have been deceived as well,\u0027 Blumenthal said. Lawmakers will also investigate if Facebook\u0027s products are harmful to children and whether or not the social media company undermined its safety efforts by disbanding its civic integrity team, as Haugen has alleged.The social media giant confirmed that Antigone Davis, its global head of safety, would also testify before the Senate Commerce Committee Consumer protection panel. Haugen\u0027s allegations have caused a headache for Facebook in recent weeks.Some of the secrets contained in the trove of tens of thousands of pages of internal company documents she copied were previously leaked to the Wall Street Journal for a series of reports dubbed the \u0027Facebook Files\u0027, including damning revelations the company knew its platform Instagram is toxic to young girls\u0027 body image. With more damaging allegations headed for the company Sunday, Clegg warned employees: \u0027We will continue to face scrutiny.\u0027 According to Clegg\u0027s email, the whistleblower will accuse her former employer of relaxing its emergency \u0027break glass\u0027 measures put in place in the lead-up to the election \u0027too soon.\u0027Haugen claimed this played a role in enabling rioters in their quest to storm the Capitol on January 6 in a riot that left five dead.The relaxation of safeguards including limits on live video allowed prospective rioters to gather on the platform and use it to plot the insurrection.Clegg pushed back at this suggestion, insisting that the so-called \u0027break glass\u0027 safeguards were only rolled back when the data showed they were able to do so.Some such measures were kept in place until February, he wrote, and some are now permanent features.  \u0027We only rolled back these emergency measures – based on careful data-driven analysis – when we saw a return to more normal conditions,\u0027 Clegg wrote. \u0027We left some of them on for a longer period of time through February this year and others, like not recommending civic, political or new Groups, we have decided to retain permanently.\u0027Clegg listed several safeguards which have been put in place in recent years and reeled off a list of success stories of handling misinformation around the election and shutting down groups focused on overturning the results. \u0027In 2020 alone, we removed more than 5 billion fake accounts — identifying almost all of them before anyone flagged them to us,\u0027 he wrote.\u0027And, from March to Election Day, we removed more than 265,000 pieces of Facebook and Instagram content in the US for violating our voter interference policies.\u0027Clegg admitted such policies were not ideal and resulted in many people and posts were impacted by this heavy-handed approach.But, he said, an \u0027extreme step\u0027 was necessary because \u0027these weren\u0027t normal circumstances.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s like shutting down an entire town\u0027s roads and highways in response to a temporary threat that may be lurking somewhere in a particular neighborhood,\u0027 he said.\u0027We wouldn\u0027t take this kind of crude, catch-all measure in normal circumstances, but these weren\u0027t normal circumstances.\u0027He wrote that the company had removed millions of pages and groups from hate groups and dangerous organizations such as the Proud Boys, QAnon conspiracy theorists and content pushing #StopTheSteal election fraud claims.  The email also pushed back at an accusation that Facebook benefits from the isiveness created on its platform.  \u0027We do not profit from polarization, in fact, just the opposite,\u0027 he wrote.\u0027We do not allow dangerous organizations, including militarized social movements or violence-inducing conspiracy networks, to organize on our platforms.\u0027The VP called any suggestion the blame for the Capitol riot lies with Big Tech \u0027so misleading\u0027 and said the blame should be on the rioters themselves and the people who incited them. \u0027The suggestion that is sometimes made that the violent insurrection on January 6 would not have occurred if it was not for social media is so misleading,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027To be clear, the responsibility for those events rests squarely with the perpetrators of the violence, and those in politics and elsewhere who actively encouraged them.\u0027The lengthy email to staff ended by urging the workforce to \u0027hold our heads up high\u0027 and \u0027be proud\u0027 of their work.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74107ade3b4a79c85a441bc8a77cad70b6bedee/136_0_1559_935/master/1559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e681e502723ed79ace0401292ffcb14f","title":"coronavirus

which would mean a cumulative loss of just over $200bn in three years as a result of Covid. Walsh called for harmonisation of travel restrictions. Given the improved data, knowledge, vaccines and testing, he said, “the idea that the measures we put in place in February 2020 are relevant today is a nonsense”. News of Pilcher’s death comes just weeks after he won a Creative Emmy for his work on the Netflix hit. He was double-vaccinated and had no underlying health conditions, as confirmed to Variety by his agency, Curtis Brown. “Glamorous and extravagant, he brought his flair and style to every design,” a statement read. “Never limited in his thought process for his creations, he pushed boundaries and created work never realised before.” Here is the full story: A further 33 people died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Monday, bringing the official tally to 136,986.  Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 161,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. You can view the UK government’s Covid dashboard here.The 53,245 deaths recorded worldwide between 27 September and 3 October, at an average of 7,606 each day, showed that the pandemic has continued the downward trend that began at the end of August, after a peak of about 10,000 deaths per day. The new weekly death toll figure is the lowest recorded since 31 October-6 November 2020. Over the last month, the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by almost a quarter, as vaccination campaigns make progress. After a year of coronavirus waves, linked in particular to the spread of variants including the more contagious Delta, the curve of new cases is also down, by almost a third compared with the end of August. With nearly 81 doses of Covid vaccine administered per 100 inhabitants worldwide, according to an AFP count, the authorities hope to see this decline continue, even if there are still major disparities between regions. For every 100 residents of North America, 123 vaccines doses have been administered. The figure for Africa is 11 doses per 100 people, with half the nations on the continent managing to fully vaccinate just two percent of their people, according to the World Health Organization’s Africa office. Since the virus was first discovered in China in late 2019, about 4.8 million people have died of Covid-19 around the world. The WHO has said that taking into account excess mortality directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19, the pandemic’s true overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records.Some 43,000 employees have received the jab since the mandate was announced on 23 August, De Blasio said. “Our parents need to know their kids will be safe,” he said. “They entrust us with their children. That’s what this mandate is all about. Every adult in our schools is now vaccinated, and that’s going to be the rule going forward.” The US secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, joined De Blasio’s virtual briefing and hailed the vaccine mandate.  “You’re doing it right,” Cardona said. “Students need to be in the classroom. They need to be safe and we need to make sure we’re doing everything possible to let our staff get vaccinated and make sure that our schools are as safe as possible.” The mayor had warned that unvaccinated school employees would be placed on unpaid leave and not be allowed to work this week. The city planned to bring in substitutes where needed. The New York schools chancellor, Meisha Ross Porter, said she did not know exactly how many employees had declined the shots and been put on leave. Implementing the mandate smoothly will be a test for De Blasio, a Democrat who boasted of the city’s record of keeping school buildings open during most of the last school year when other districts went to all-remote instruction. New York City is not offering a remote option this year. The vaccination mandate in the nation’s largest school system does not include a test-out option, but does allow for medical and religious exemptions. It was supposed to go into effect last week but was delayed when a federal appeals court granted a temporary injunction. An appeals panel reversed that decision three days later. New York City’s public school system, which has more than a million students, is one of the first in the nation to require inoculations for all staff members. A similar mandate is set to come into effect in Los Angeles on 15 October. A group of teachers and other school employees who had sued over New York’s school vaccine mandate asked the US supreme court on Thursday for an emergency injunction blocking its implementation. The request was denied on Friday. Many students and parents support the vaccine mandate as the best way to keep schools open during the pandemic. “It’s safer for our kids,” said Joyce Ramirez, 28, who was picking her three children up from a Bronx elementary school last week. She hopes the requirement will lessen the chances of teachers contracting the virus and prompting classroom or school shutdowns. Cody Miller, a 15-year-old sophomore at a high school in Manhattan, said teachers should all be vaccinated. “I think they should,” said the teen, who got vaccinated himself as soon as the Pfizer shot was approved for 12-year-olds and up. “It’s so many kids. It’s a big environment, you know?” But Mally Diroche, another Bronx parent, had mixed feelings. “I kind of feel like that’s a decision they should be able to make on their own,” said the mother of three boys between 3 and 12. Diroche, 29, said she felt that masks and other precautions could check the spread of the virus within schools. Some educators have reservations about the mandate but are complying. Maurice Jones, 46, a support staff member at a Manhattan middle school, said he got vaccinated months ago but sympathises with co-workers who have not gotten the shots. “If they’ve got to get tested more, they’ve got to get tested more,” Jones said. “I don’t think they should lose their job.” Roxanne Rizzi, who teaches technology at an elementary school in Queens, waited until Friday to get her first coronavirus vaccine shot. “I had to do it for the finances of my family,” she said. Rizzi, 55, had resisted the vaccine because she contracted Covid in November and believed natural immunity would protect her. She said she would continue to protest against the mandate. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people should get vaccinated even if they have already been infected by the virus. The agency says Covid vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity and help prevent getting infected again.There have been more than 200,000 reported weekly cases among children in the past five consecutive weeks, with most cases spreading in areas with no school mask mandates in place and low vaccination rates, as vaccines for children under the age of 12 continue to await federal approval. Several schools and school districts have periodically been forced to close in-person learning because of Covid exposure or high infection rates, leaving teachers struggling to continue their lessons through the disruptions. A shortage of teachers in the US was already a growing problem before the pandemic, particularly in high-poverty schools and it has worsened during the pandemic. Some schools have closed when too many teaching positions could not be filled, while others have grappled with higher than normal teacher vacancies, leaving remaining teachers overworked. Read the full report here: Although Venezuelans have used such platforms for years to cover the cost of medical treatment and operations in the country, now in its seventh year of economic crisis, the onset of the Covid pandemic has dramatically increased the practice. The state of Venezuela’s already overloaded and crumbling public health system, in which hospitals often lack access even to water, has pushed many to use costly private centres. Meanwhile, vaccination campaigns have been slow while drug prices increase as the country consolidates an informal dollarisation. As a result of voracious inflation, most Venezuelans have no savings. Now some families and friends of patients with Covid post weekly appeals for funds on Twitter and Facebook, often using an account loaned to them from someone abroad if asking in dollars. In July, Miguelangel Borsegui, a 20-year-old engineering student, posted to Twitter in search of help towards getting medicine and oxygen for his 62-year-old mother, who had Covid and was receiving treatment at home. Two weeks before his mother got sick, he lost his job, and by the time he posted on Twitter, he had contracted the virus himself. Meanwhile the bills had racked up to more than $700 (£515) and continued to rise. “It was the hardest thing I’ve had to live through. But the crowdfunding had more reach than expected,” he said. In Venezuela, the average monthly salary of a worker in the private sector reaches just over $50 and in the public sector $4.70, according to an estimate from the Venezuelan Observatory of Finance. Antiviral medicines often cost $80 an injection, while an oxygen machine, without canisters, can cost $1,000. Milfri Perez, a self-employed journalist whose 86-year-old father died of Covid at home in August, posted on social media as costs reached over $10,000 between medicines, tests, nurses’ fees and oxygen. The nearest private clinic cost a prohibitive $3,000 a day. Many of the social media crowdfunding efforts are to pay off debts of the deceased. German Cortez, president of Venezuela’s medical clinic association, said sometimes they just tell families what medicines to buy more cheaply elsewhere. Those with friends and family in public hospitals have to bring supplies because of the lack of medicines and equipment. Carlos Roque, a pharmacist, turned to social media to cobble together funds to hire an external service to provide his mother, who later died, with dialysis because the hospital’s machine was not working. Each dialysis cost $725. Part of the expense was covered from his posts on social media, but not all of it. Venezuela’s official Covid case count exceeds 372,000, while its death toll is more than 4,500, although doctors and medical academies say that the figures are higher. Moscow may soon bring back incentives, such as prize draws, for people to get vaccinated, said the city’s mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, as authorities struggle to contain a wave of cases and deaths. The 25,781 new infections reported nationwide on Monday was the most since 2 January. “The vaccination rate, despite the complete preparedness of all infrastructure, leaves much to be desired,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday. Vaccine hesitancy has hampered Russia’s inoculation drive. Russians who have refused the vaccination have frequently cited a general fear of new medical products and distrust of the authorities as their reasons. Authorities relaxed many restrictions after Russia overcame the worst of a third wave of the virus in the summer, but the daily number of coronavirus-related deaths, which stood at 883 on Monday, has remained high and regularly reaches a record single-day rise. Now, with cases also rising sharply, which Sobyanin said was a cause for concern, restrictions look set to return, although officials have said that lockdowns are not being considered. Some regions are planning to force people to show proof of vaccination, a recent negative test, or evidence of immunity, before visiting venues like cinemas and gyms. The regional government in Kaliningrad said on Monday that measure would extend to restaurants and cafes from 8 October. Mass events of more than 3,000 people are banned across the country, said Anna Popova, head of consumer health regulator Rospotrebnadzor. Events of more than 1,000 people are permitted in just two of Russia’s more than 80 regions, she said.The strike, which began on 2 August, was organised by the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) to protest against the delayed payment of salaries and allowances – a recurrent problem in Nigeria’s healthcare sector. The NARD said resident doctors – medical school graduates training as specialists who play a major role on emergency wards – would return to work on Wednesday after some of the payments had been made. However, it called on the federal and state governments to urgently address outstanding issues such as what it said was a failure to pay benefits to the relatives of doctors who had died of Covid-19 after caring for patients affected by the virus. The NARD said its executive committee would reconvene in six weeks to assess the progress made.The long-awaited guidance comes after several EU member states pre-empted the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) opinion and launched their own booster campaigns, although they vary widely over who is eligible. The EU joins the US, UK and Israel, where regulators have approved the use of Pfizer boosters, although there is no consensus among scientists about how broadly they should be deployed. Israel is the outlier, using them across the whole population. Governments are under pressure to revive their ailing economies, fight the more infectious Delta coronavirus variant, and avoid further lockdowns in the winter. The EMA’s ruling comes after the EU’s infectious diseases centre warned last week that the region’s coverage of vaccines was still too low and there was a risk of a significant surge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks. The EMA said people with a severely weakened immune system should be given a third dose of the vaccines from PfizerBioNTech and Moderna – both based on mRNA technology – at least 28 days after their second one. It also said a booster shot of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine could be considered for adults with normal immune systems about six months after the second dose, but added that that was up to inidual countries. “At national level, public health bodies may issue official recommendations on the use of booster doses, taking into account emerging effectiveness data and the limited safety data,” it said. The World Health Organization has criticised rich nations for hoarding Covid-19 vaccines for booster campaigns for larger population groups, while poorer countries are struggling even to roll out first doses. Allowing EU countries to decide broader use of a booster is consistent with the EMA’s earlier decisions in the pandemic. For instance, it largely left it up to member states to decide whether to restrict vaccines in the face of potential side effects."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Evgeny PaulinSputnikAFP via GettyIn September 2003, a secret transaction took place. The location was Monaco, a tax haven associated with the international rich. Specifically, an exclusive block just beneath its lavish casino. An apartment changed hands. A local notary signed the deal. Purchase price: €3.6 million.For this, the buyer got a luxury fourth-floor flat, two parking spaces, a storeroom, and the use of a pool in the Monte Carlo Star complex.From the balcony the new owner could gaze down on Monaco’s sparkling marina, stuffed during the summer with moored superyachts. Security ensured residents were undisturbed by tourists milling around a mini-garden built on the complex’s roof. There were sounds, too, pleasant ones – the clatter of helicopters ferrying new arrivals from Nice airport, and the screeching of swifts.The identity of the flat’s buyer was a mystery. The official “purchaser” was an offshore company listed in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Brockville Development Ltd. Brockville was in turn owned by two further Panama-registered entities – Sefton Securities and, later, Radnor Investments SA. To outsiders, the arrangements looked a little like a Russian doll, with the ultimate beneficiary nestled under layers.The Monte Carlo Star complex overlooks Monaco’s Marina. Thanks to documents in the Pandora papers, the  can identify the flat’s buyer – a woman, 28-years-old in 2003, and at the time unknown. Name: Svetlana Krivonogikh. In the space of a few years, around the turn of the millennium, Krivonogikh became extremely wealthy. She acquired a flat in a prestigious compound in her home city of St Petersburg, properties in Moscow, a yacht, and other assets, worth an estimated €86 million.How to explain her fairytale rise? According to media reports, Krivonogikh’s background is modest. She grew up in a communal apartment, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with five families.Krivonogikh was a business student and worked as a cleaner in a store. Then, in the late 1990s, she appears to have acquired a benefactor: Vladimir Putin.In 2020, the investigative website Proekt – one of Russia’s few remaining independent media outlets – claimed Krivonogikh formed a friendship with Putin when he was St Petersburg’s deputy mayor. She became Putin’s lover, it alleged.Regardless of the exact nature of their relationship, they seem to have been close. The scant public evidence indicates they travelled together on the same planes, for example, as Putin climbed towards power. In 1998, he became the FSB spy agency chief, then prime minister, and in 2000, president as Boris Yeltsin’s successor.Three years later, in March 2003, Krivonogikh gave birth to a daughter, Elizaveta, or Luiza. Proekt has claimed Putin is Luiza’s father.The Kremlin has not commented. Putin does not discuss his private life. He and his wife, Lyudmila – who have two daughters, Masha and Katerina – orced in 2013.After the Proekt scoop was published Luiza took part in social media chat forums. Her Instagram features images of parties, friends from influential families, and trips on private jets. Luiza has always dodged questions about Putin. She and her mother did not respond to questions from the .Political figures are entitled to a private life. But the Krivonogikh story is not merely about an alleged romance that fizzled out some time ago. Rather it is about money, and how, according to the Pandora papers, some of Putin’s inner circle used Monaco as a discreet hub for their financial affairs. There is geopolitics, too. Prince Albert, Monaco’s ruler, has good relations with Putin.Over the past two decades, Russian influence in Monaco has grown. “It has become Moscow-on-Sea. The mentality is to show off,” said Dominique Anastasis, a local lawyer. Foreigners including rich Russians were attracted by the warm climate and the lack of tax, he said.“Nobody asks where your money comes from. There’s no culture of checking. You don’t make a tax declaration.”The secret flat transaction is also a tale of modern Russia: how a tightly knit group of ambitious KGB officers turned to a tax haven to help enrich themselves – spies who came in from the cold, in John le Carré’s phrase.Accounting for discretionWalk up past the casino and the five-star Hôtel de Paris, with its Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis, and you reach Rue de Lilas. At numbers four to six are the offices of Moores Rowland. A professional accountancy and tax firm, it is connected to a network of law companies and offshore service providers around the world. There is little to be seen from outside other than a pleasant roof garden.The firm has a British managing director, Eamonn McGregor. Documents show it was McGregor who set up Brockville Development Ltd, Krivonogikh’s BVI company.It is unclear how he became the accountant. His biography offers few clues. The son of a police constable, McGregor was born in 1950 in the seaside town of Southport, Merseyside. He trained in Liverpool, working for Littlewoods Mail Order Stores, and joined Moores Rowland in 1978. An expert on tax policy, he speaks French and Italian. In 1998, prince Rainier, the then monarch, made McGregor a knight and Chevalier in the order of St Charles.The Pandora papers reveal McGregor’s wealthy Monaco clients. They include Gennady Timchenko, a one-time Soviet bureaucrat. Forbes estimates Timchenko’s fortune at €18 billion. McGregor has looked after his family and business assets for at least 20 years. Among them are jets and a 40m pleasure yacht, the MS Lena, named after Timchenko’s wife.Timchenko and Putin have been friends since at least the early 1990s when the former was a St Petersburg oil trader and the latter a rising politician. In 1991, Putin – then head of the city’s foreign relations committee – gave Timchenko an oil export licence.Timchenko went on to co-found Gunvor, a Swiss-based trading house that exports Russian oil, some billions of dollars-worth. The question of who exactly benefits from Gunvor is contested. In 2007, the Moscow political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky alleged Putin was a beneficiary of the company’s activities – in effect a sleeping co-owner – something Gunvor says is “ridiculous”. It denies he has – or ever had – an interest.Putin has said Timchenko’s rise “was absolutely without my participation”. In 2014, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Timchenko, together with other members of the “Russian leadership’s inner circle”. All acted on behalf of Putin, it alleged, who was described as a “senior Russian government official”. The US treasury department said: “Timchenko’s activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin. Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds.”Moores Rowland says it cannot discuss its clients because of a “strict duty of confidence”. It says that at all times it complies with “all applicable laws and regulations”. And that customers are taken on – or “onboarded” – following “rigorous” checks. Moores Rowland is in contact with regulators in Monaco and beyond and follows guidance and advice whenever necessary, it adds. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing and there is nothing illegal or improper about setting up offshore companies.But the Pandora papers do show how the firm assists well-off iniduals, some of them subject to US sanctions, to hide their beneficial ownership. There are also questions remaining around exactly what due diligence it carries out on the sources of clients’ wealth. And whether the regulatory regimes where it operates are fit for purpose. Its glossy brochure says “maintaining confidentiality and minimising tax burdens” is key to the service it provides.Normally a customer would buy a personalised offshore firm. From 2002, however, Moores Rowland started using an innovative new system. It employed a small group of in-house offshore companies, fronted by nominee directors. These were used to maintain the assets of different clients.Thus, a single corporate structure, Radnor Investments, held Timchenko’s yacht, Krivonogikh’s flat and much else. Radnor had shares in another entity, Roxlane Corporate. Roxlane Corporate then signed a so-called “bare trust agreement” with Timchenko, permitting him to use his own yacht.In maze-like fashion, the names of high-value customers vanished from the public record. Legally.Moores Rowland also set up a corporate account for Krivonogikh with a private bank in Zurich, EFG. The records do not show how much cash the account may have contained. McGregor continued to render professional help to Krivonogikh in 2015, for example, sending letters to EFG promising to inform the bank of any change of ownership.The leak sheds light on these compartmentalised arrangements. And it raises questions over whether Putin may personally profit from Russia’s oil transfer trade, as the US alleges.Timchenko went into business with two partners from Leningrad. The Pandora papers show all three were registered as owners of International Petroleum Products (IPP), a private company with its roots in the Soviet era. Moores Rowland managed IPP. Lawyers for Timchenko say he has always acted “entirely lawfully throughout his career and business dealings”.By the time Putin became president, this partnership was beginning to crack. The Leningrad trio fell out, and in October 2003 they all resigned from the company, documents show. The same day a new director replaced them. His name was Petr Kolbin. He had few qualifications for the role. Except perhaps for one: he was an old family friend of Putin.Friends for lifeIn December 1941, Viktor Kolbin was wounded while fighting the Germans on the Leningrad front. It was bitterly cold. As he recalled decades later, Kolbin was unable to move and badly hurt, his blood staining the snow.A medic dragged him away. He lived through the great patriotic war, as Russians call the second World War, and later became a teacher and director of a village school in Imenitsy, not far from Estonia.In the summer of 1954, a family from Leningrad rented a room in the village from Kolbin’s aunt. They were the Putins. Kolbin got on well with the Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, who had also been wounded while fighting near Leningrad. Both men had survived the Nazi blockade of the city, in which so many perished.“We found a common language,” Kolbin told his local Pravda Severa newspaper in 2002. The Putins brought their two-year-old with them – a little boy, also Vladimir.Kolbin’s son Petr and the young Vladimir became friends. In 1969 – when Petr was 17 and Vladimir 16 – the two teenagers went off to a dance in the neighbouring village. According to Viktor Kolbin, they got into a fight with some local boys, returning home late with bruises and a cracked lip. Putin began to learn judo. He wanted to join the KGB, an agency celebrated in Soviet films.In 2001, Petr Kolbin went into business and prospered. A subsidiary of a Kolbin company supplied equipment to Gazprom. Another Kolbin enterprise, Surguteks, became the main exporter for Surgutneftegas, Russia’s fourth-biggest oil concern. Kolbin joined Timchenko as a partner in various ventures, including IPP and Gunvor, where he acquired a 10 per cent stake.The money flooded in. Moores Rowland records show Kolbin opened a Swiss bank account, set up in May 2002 with Vontobel bank in Zurich. It was registered in the name of a Panamanian shell company, Insize Industries SA. A week later, Dmitry Gorelov, a KGB officer who knew Putin from the 1980s, when they were stationed in Dresden, became a second signatory. In 2006, Kolbin and Gorelov opened a second account with HSBC Singapore.Kolbin’s riches eventually grew to €473 million.But was this money actually his?According to the Russian journalist Roman Shleynov, who in 2012 spoke to Kolbin, Putin’s friend led a modest life. “He was a regular guy from St Petersburg. He drove a Toyota. He flew Aeroflot. He had a small dog. He told me himself: ‘I am no businessman.’ ”Shleynov added: “Kolbin had a telephone with him at all times. Senior ‘comrades’ would ring him. They told him what to sign.”For a long time Kolbin operated in the shadows. Then, in 2012, the Russian newspaper Vedomosti outed him as Gunvor’s third co-owner, together with Timchenko and its Swedish chief executive, Torbjörn Törnqvist. When the US imposed sanctions on Timchenko in 2014, IPP – by this point known as LTS Holdings – was transferred to Kolbin, the documents suggest.Gunvor says Timchenko had “fully and irrevocably” ested from the firm at this stage. It says he now has “absolutely no involvement”. Kolbin’s family link to Putin emerged in 2016, when the TV station Rain went to Kolbin’s Leningrad region village and talked to his neighbours. According to Forbes, Kolbin died in 2018.The opposition leader Alexei Navalny – now in jail, having been poisoned last year in Siberia – has claimed Gunvor belongs to Putin, the world’s “richest man”. Gunvor vehemently denies this.Others, including the campaigner Bill Browder, have alleged the president uses a variety of proxies. “Putin is smart. You can’t expect to find an account in his name,” said Navalny’s deputy, Leonid Volkov. “But if you see ‘Kolbin’ you can be sure as hell this is Putin’s money.”Shadow wealthIn 2006, Putin was seen swooshing down the snow in dark glasses. He had come to the launch of his favourite ski resort, Igora. Named after a local lake, it is not far from the Ozero community, 60 miles north of St Petersburg, where in the 1990s, Putin and his circle built themselves comfortable homes.One Ozera member was Yuri Kovalchuk, the biggest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, a St Petersburg bank founded in 1990 with Communist party funds. When Putin became president, its balance sheet ballooned. Billions flowed into its accounts. The White House alleges Bank Rossiya belongs to the Ozero group. It has labelled Kovalchuk Putin’s “personal banker”.Kovalchuk’s other assets include the Igora resort, which belongs to a company called Ozon LLC. Kovalchuk has a 25 per cent share. The other 75 per cent is owned by Lowbrook Trading, a firm registered in Cyprus. In 2016, the Panama papers shed light on these opaque matters. Between 2009 and 2011, Ozon received €9.3 million in three unsecured loans. The cash came from an offshore company, Sandalwood Continental, which was linked to another of Putin’s old friends, the cellist Sergei Roldugin.In 2020, Proekt identified Krivonogikh as Igora’s other hidden owner. There seems to be little doubt Putin is fond of the resort. According to Reuters, it was the venue in 2013 for the wedding of the president’s daughter Katerina to Kirill Shamalov, the son of another old friend of Putin, Nikolai Shamalov. Shamalov is a Bank Rossiya shareholder.So, it turns out, is Krivonogikh. By 2007, her company Relax owned 3.6 per cent of the bank, according to public records this later dropped to 2.8 per cent.The enrichment of Putin’s cronies began during his first Kremlin term, a time when the president was publicly declaring war against oligarchs. He railed against businessmen who made their fortunes in the 1990s and who considered themselves – as Putin put it – to be gods. In recent years, Putin has complained about unpatriotic tycoons who hide their money offshore.Krivonogikh’s Monte Carlo apartment, it seems, is part of a much bigger shadow portfolio. Where the cash came from to fund the purchase is uncertain. Nor do we understand how Krivonogikh became a Moores Rowland customer. Or if the firm was aware of her political connections in Moscow. Roldugin, Gorelov, Kovalchuk and Bank Rossiya all declined to comment.But the big picture revealed by the Pandora papers is stark enough. Putin did not tame the oligarchs. Instead, the leak indicates the existence of a new feudal system, where his friends and KGB associates have been the principal beneficiaries. Some acquired huge paper fortunes of their own. The suspicion is this wealth is ultimately not theirs.Back at the Monte Carlo Star, nobody was able to explain whether Krivonogikh lived in the property. The concierge said her name was not listed.

Photograph: Mark MitchellAP New Zealand on Monday abandoned its longstanding strategy of eliminating coronavirus amid a persistent Delta outbreak, and will instead look to live with the virus and control its spread as its vaccination rate rises.The Pacific nation was among just a handful of countries to bring Covid-19 cases down to zero last year and largely stayed virus-free until an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant in mid-August frustrated efforts to stamp out transmission.“With this outbreak and Delta the return to zero is incredibly difficult,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern told a news conference in a major policy shift.“This is a change in approach we were always going to make over time. Our Delta outbreak has accelerated this transition. Vaccines will support it,” she said.Ms Ardern said a lockdown affecting 1.7 million people in the biggest city, Auckland, will be scaled back in phases, with some freedoms introduced from Wednesday.The change of direction came as the country recorded 29 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the total number in the current outbreak to 1,357. Most cases are in Auckland, which has been in lockdown for nearly 50 days.Amid mounting pressure, Ms Ardern has said her strategy was never to have zero cases, but to aggressively stamp out the virus. She said strict lockdowns will end once 90 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated.About two million New Zealanders have so far been fully vaccinated, or about 48 per cent of the eligible population.Mr Ardern said the Delta variant felt like “a tentacle that has been incredibly hard to shake”.“It’s clear that a long period of heavy restrictions has not got us to zero cases. But its okay ... elimination was important because we didn’t have vaccinations. Now we do. So we can begin to change the way we do things,” she said.People in Auckland will be able to leave their homes to connect with others outdoors from Wednesday, with a limit of 10 people, as well as go to beaches and parks.IsolationWorldwide deaths related to Covid-19 surpassed 5 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, with unvaccinated people particularly exposed to the virulent Delta strain.Ms Ardern used strict lockdowns and New Zealand’s geographic isolation to eliminate coronavirus last year, a feat that helped her secure an historic election victory.But a sluggish vaccine rollout and the persistent Delta outbreak this year has dented her popularity.Aucklanders turned to social media after the announcement, with many cheering the decision while others expressed concern.University of Auckland professor Shaun Hendy, who has been modelling the spread of Covid-19, said the new freedoms were likely to lead to greater spread and higher case numbers in coming weeks.“The government will be hoping that any growth in cases that result is slow enough that vaccination can get ahead of the outbreak, before it puts significant strain on our testing and tracing system, not to mention our hospitals,” Hendy said.Political parties on both sides slammed the move.“Jacinda Ardern has no answers to problems that she and her government promised us were under control. The situation is now, very clearly, out of control and worsening every day,” opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said in a statement.Ms Ardern’s Labour Party coalition partner, the Greens, said the move put vulnerable communities and children at risk. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Inside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"government denial levelling decarbonisation incompatible","story":"The Government now has two main strategic aims: levelling up and decarbonisation. Levelling up aims to encourage the creation of more high-skill, high-wage jobs in every corner of the land. The problem is that its second strategy, decarbonisation, is steadily destroying well-paid jobs. Worse still, the Government is refusing to admit the contradiction, preferring to claim that thousands of high-wage green jobs will emerge. Not facing up to inconvenient facts usually leads sooner or later to disaster, as the petrol-pump fiasco has surely reminded us.There is now a Government department with levelling up in its name, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and policy details are still being worked out. But, in practice, levelling up has already been quietly steering some Government policies. The most obvious is infrastructure spending, which is gradually being allocated more equitably throughout the regions. Less obvious is corporation tax reform. The Government has been criticised for putting up corporation tax, from 19 per cent now to 25 per cent from April 2023, but the increase went hand in hand with a tax break to encourage capital investment.The Government appears to believe that cutting corporation tax would not necessarily lead to investment. Consequently it has changed the rules to incentivise an investment surge within a two-year window. From April 2021 to March 2023 investing in qualifying new plant and machinery will benefit from a super-deduction of 130 per cent. A Treasury factsheet explains that previously a capital investment of £10 million would reduce corporation tax by £497,800 in the first year, whereas under the new regime companies will pay £2.47 million less tax because they can deduct £13 million from taxable profits. An incentive on this scale should produce a dramatic increase in corporate investment, in good time for the next general election.Immigration control has also been clearly linked to levelling up and has helped to raise wages. Whenever employer lobbies call for more immigration to drive wages down the Government has been inclined to tick them off and urge them to invest in British workers. We want a high-wage, high-skills economy with controlled immigration. What they want is low wages, low skills and uncontrolled immigration, said the Prime Minister in September 2021. Moreover, rising wages will encourage employers to invest in raising productivity.Some Government policies, however, do not promote levelling up, notably the apprenticeship levy, foreign takeovers and decarbonisation.The biggest blind spot in the levelling up-agenda is decarbonisation. It is not so much that the Government has decided to give decarbonisation priority over levelling up, it is rather that it is in denial about the clash between the two strategies. No doubt decarbonisation will produce some new green jobs, but it is already destroying jobs in energy-intensive sectors including steel, cement and chemicals. In practice we have a public policy of deliberately adding to the production costs of key industries in full knowledge that the result will be to make them less competitive than overseas rivals. These sectors will move to locations where they are made to feel welcome, often to countries such as China that have demonstrated their aggressive intentions. The Government should face up to the contradiction and seek solutions. Germany, for example, has a similar green policy that has also increased electricity costs, but it pays subsidies to energy-intensive industries so they can still compete internationally.Everyone agrees that skills training is vital to our future success but one of the Government’s flagship policies, the apprenticeship levy, has not worked. It was introduced in 2017 and companies felt they were paying 0.5 per cent of payroll into an account under their control. But the system was over-regulated and not employer led. For many companies, the levy was just another tax. The majority of employers interviewed in 2020 by Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation, thought it was failing manufacturers of all sizes and should be radically reformed or scrapped. One alternative would be a training tax credit, along the lines of the R\u0026ampD tax credit.Foreign takeovers also undermine levelling up. Here the issue is not so much a clash between strategies, but rather that different elements in government are pulling in opposite directions. We should ask whether a takeover puts a foreign government in a position to exert pressure on us. China has shown it is willing to apply economic pressure to countries such as Australia and France has recently threatened to cut off the electricity supply to Jersey. The Government has Project Defend ostensibly to ensure that key assets are not bought by hostile governments, and the National Security and Investment Act gives ministers new powers from next January. The Government needs to start making full use of them.The Government has embraced decarbonisation with religious zeal, but faith can harden the heart and dull the reasoning mind. The Government should not allow its faith-induced utopian mindset to blind it to the brute reality that decarbonisation can destroy jobs as well as create them. The Government is used to carrying out equality impact assessments. We now urgently need decarbonisation policies to be subject to a genuinely objective levelling-up impact assessment, and when there is a clash to give priority to levelling up.More from NewsTaiwan asks Australia to help prepare for war as China steps up harassmentWhitehall urged to end ‘woke-ing from home’ culture\u0026#39My body is 51 but my soul is 8\u0026#39: Victims of sexual abuse confront French priests in play about rapeProsecutors in trial of Northern Ireland veteran tell court their case is \u0026#39circumstantial\u0026#39Southern Water pumps sewage into coastal bathing spots as campaigners call for tougher restrictionsWho is to blame for empty shelves and fuel shortages?

Be careful and don’t walk home alone? Or should they merely offer a cheery farewell, perhaps coupled with that reminder we constantly read on social media - that every woman has the right to go where she wants, when she wants?In an ideal world, neither sentiment would need expression. But the world is far from ideal, and when a woman opts to take a short cut through isolated parkland or walk by herself in the early hours, she increases her level of risk should a predatory opportunist be lurking nearby. That, unfortunately, is just the reality - since there are still rapists and misogynists and all sorts of nasty people. Yet offering words of caution are interpreted as apportioning blame - as it has been ever since the early days of the investigation into Sarah Everard\u0027s disappearance, when police warned women in the area where she vanished should not go out alone. The response was nuclear. Why weren’t men being warned not to go out alone, fumed incensed detractors who missed the point entirely. Principally, women’s safety is a matter of strength. Biology usually makes men stronger than women and thus better able to protect themselves. This goes some way to explain why 32 per cent of women in the UK feel unsafe or very unsafe when walking alone in their local area at night, while only 13 per cent of men expressed the same concern. If we are going to let women feel safer we have to be able to offer sensible, precautionary words without fear of censure. Yet it remains a near impossible message to communicate this. Only the other day, on social media, one female charity worker offered scalding assessment of such an approach. She wrote how she was incensed at the media \u0027telling\u0027 women to \u0027stay safe\u0027. “Violent men are the problem,” she stormed.  “Enough is enough.”Of course men who perpetrate violence against women are the problem. The only person responsible for rape or murder is the attacker. And of course it is imperative to find strategies to educate men about violence and sexual objection of women. But this mustn’t preclude sensible and instructive warnings about the reality of being a lone female.It isn\u0027t finger pointing to explain the risk women who are out on their own may face, especially at night, such as that they should maintain a high awareness of their surroundings. Yes, it is shocking that we have a society where women should inform others about their whereabouts or hold keys in their pocket so they have an improvised weapon to hand, but this is how the world is at present. And until things change it is sensible to tell women to take care.I for one will do it now, more than ever. And will be grateful to those who remind me too.More from NewsWhitehall urged to end ‘woke-ing from home’ culture\u0026#39My body is 51 but my soul is 8\u0026#39: Victims of sexual abuse confront French priests in play about rapeProsecutors in trial of Northern Ireland veteran tell court their case is \u0026#39circumstantial\u0026#39Southern Water pumps sewage into coastal bathing spots as campaigners call for tougher restrictionsWho is to blame for empty shelves and fuel shortages?

Who is there among her cabinet of relative political pygmies that could step into her shoes and lead the nation with the same flair and intelligence?Salmond was indeed a political genius. He had that rare mix of humour, gravitas and intelligence that would have made him an outstanding leader of any party he had chosen to join. As press officer for the Scottish Labour Party in the early 1990s, I can attest to the fear that Salmond inspired among our party’s senior figures. Yes, Donald Dewar was cleverer and more principled, but he was no match for Salmond’s soundbite-heavy witticisms.And when Salmond ascended to the position of first minister (with hindsight, an event we should all have recognised, many years before, as inevitable), he truly dominated the political and cultural landscape. Consider his achievements: taking the SNP into government, winning an overall majority for his party through a system specifically designed to avoid such a result, and forcing the UK government to concede an independence referendum. This latter achievement is all the more staggering when you consider that support for separatism at the time among Scots was barely 30 per cent.Throughout much of his time as first minister, the general view in Labour’s ranks was that once he was forced – or chose – to resign, the SNP were in deep trouble. The most likely candidate to succeed him was his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, and she lacked almost every quality that had made Salmond such an effective performer.We all know what happened next. In the wake of the 2014 referendum, Salmond resigned and Scottish Labour’s support collapsed, making Sturgeon’s arrival as first minister seemingly blessed. In the run-up to Salmond’s departure, the SNP recognised that it was perhaps not enough for Sturgeon simply to take his place if she lacked Salmond’s demagogic skills and his quick wit, maybe she could be reinvented as a rock star. Which is what happened: a leadership “contest” in which no other candidate stood turned into a stadium tour, with the word “Nicola” written in light bulbs in huge letters on the stage behind her. Thousands crammed into venues, shrieking in excitement as the putative first minister spoke. Sturgeon maintained the poll lead her successor bequeathed and used the momentum of her own party’s triumphalism to secure a nationalist landslide at the 2015 general election. She has since gone on to win large parliamentary majorities and a plurality of the Scottish vote at two Scottish and another two general elections. Wistful London-based, Remain-supporting commentators idolise Sturgeon for her lifelong (since 2016) devotion to all things EU and see in her a champion of progressive politics, such a contrast to the Conservative politicians they despise and the Labour ones who disappoint them.Did Labour and the SNP’s other opponents simply make a misjudgement, then, about Sturgeon’s potential as a national leader? Or is there something entirely missing from the equation that Sturgeon’s fans fail to see using their thistle-tinted glasses?A recent conversation I had with an SNP-supporting relative summarises the enigma of Nicola Sturgeon. After my relative had waxed lyrical about the first minister’s inspiring leadership during the recent pandemic, I asked her what she thought Sturgeon’s greatest achievement in 14 years as a Scottish Government minister had been.Answer came there none. Because, of course, there are no such achievements. Both as a minister and as the person in charge of all her ministerial colleagues, health, education, transport, the economy and those areas of social security that have been devolved have shown no measurable improvement, and indeed most of them have regressed. Her electoral record is impressive, but she still hasn’t bettered Salmond’s 2011 achievement of securing an overall majority at Holyrood, and has made zero progress on securing the much-anticipated rerun referendum on independence.And yet at a Scottish political awards event sponsored by Holyrood magazine, the 400-strong audience was invited, at the start of the evening, to “show our appreciation” for the first minister’s leadership during the pandemic. Setting aside the absurdity of a North Korean-style political culture that lionises, without criticism, any political leader, even the Scottish Government’s record in fighting Covid has hardly been impressive. “Workmanlike”, perhaps, but no better than that.Lightning did not strike twice. Salmond was not succeeded by a politician of the same ability. He was followed by a competent person who has who has proved she is more than capable of reading out the briefings written for her on prime time TV, and who has benefited from a staggeringly compliant broadcast media and a publicly-funded and slavishly loyal civic society. This is very bad news for her opponents. Because what can be done for Sturgeon can and will be done for whoever follows her. Labour didn’t underestimate Sturgeon when she was Salmond’s deputy they simply didn’t anticipate the extent to which the SNP machine is able to manipulate the media and drive an ultra-disciplined central narrative.None of this is to say that Sturgeon is a bad politician or leader she’s clearly effective – electoral results prove that. But we’ve been here before, looking at the possible successors to the incumbent and thinking there’s a paucity of talent.

Amid tense scenes outside the Tory conference in Manchester, Dominic Hutchins, , told the Leader of the Commons what he had to go through to prove he was eligible for welfare benefits. Police and demonstrators stood by during the three-minute showdown just outside the Midland Hotel and its ring-of-steel secure zone. Mr Rees-Mogg, who had walked a gauntlet of angry protesters chanting “Tory scum!” before stopping to speak to Mr Hutchins, told him: “I strongly advise you to speak to your MP.” Speaking later to the Mirror, Mr Hutchins, who lives near Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: “He heard me but it’s all lip service.  “A lot of people with disabilities can’t do this, their voices aren’t heard so I tried to go out to make the point. “If I don’t do it, the people like me who have cerebral palsy will never be heard.” Mr Hutchins, who receives a personal independence payment, said the fitness to work assessment left him feeling “downgraded”. “I have had cerebral palsy from birth. Two years ago I had to prove I have still got cerebral palsy,” he said. “I had an hour-long assessment telling them everything I can’t do - do you know how inhuman that is ” He claimed: “They are making it harder and harder - it’s shameful.” Mr Hutchins told how he lost his job because of Conservative cuts to youth services. “I have got a degree, I graduated from Huddersfield in ,” he said. “I’m a youth and community worker. Since the Tories got in power in  they have demolished youth services, which made me claim benefits. “I not only had to claim jobseeker’s allowance, I had to prove I am still disabled and I’ve not medically been cured.“People like Jacob Rees-Mogg - he will go back to his fancy house.They don’t care, it’s all lip service to shut people like me up. It’s awful.” The altercation came as Mr Rees-Mogg said he was proud to be Tory scum and recounted how activists has scrawled the word on the front of his house.  Asked by LBChe was racist  Misogynistic  Scum , he said:Well, do you know that the Duke of Wellington… referred to the British Army as the scum of the world, scum of the earth he said, and he said but look what we’ve made out of the scum… what find men we have created.And I think those of us who are proud to be Tory scum, look at what fine people we’ve been made by being Tories and being educated by this great party and following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson.So, I’m not too fussed. Askedhe was proud, he said: I don’t care. We did have somebody come and write ‘scum’ on our front door at home and my we said ‘this is outrageous and shocking. They should’ve put ‘Tory Scum’.I meanyou’re going to put it, you’ve got to put it right.

Half-term holidays will be easier as the amber list is scrapped, while testing requirements are set to be relaxed for double-jabbed Brits. There will also be a fresh update on the red list this week - with reports claiming it could be slashed from  countries to just nine. From today the amber and green lists are being axed and the system splits countries into two categories - red list, and ‘rest of the world’. Butyou’re not double-jabbed, the rules are actually stricter - as all countries will essentially have the same rules as the old amber list. Here’s the new system explained, plus extra changes that could soon be coming down the track.   What were the old rules that’ve been scrapped  Until today the UK split foreign countries into three lists - red, amber and green - with rules for people arriving from each colour. Travel to the UK from red list countries is banned, unless you are a British or Irish national or have UK residence rights. If you enter the UK from a red list country, you must spend  nights in a quarantine hotel costing £, per adult. Amber list countries had two sets of rules - one set for vaccinated people and another set for unvaccinated people. Double-vaccinated people entering the UK from amber list countries had to pay for a PCR or lateral flow test before their flight, and a PCR test within two days of landing. They did not have to isolate. Unvaccinated people entering the UK from amber list countries had to pay for a PCR or lateral flow test before their flight, and two PCR tests - one on Day  and another on Day . They also had to quarantine at home for  days. Green list ees did not have to isolate but did have to take two tests - one before their flight and one after - regardless of jab status.  What are the new rules in the latest update  The amber and green lists have been scrapped entirely, leaving two categories - the red list and the rest of the world. For ’no-go’ red list countries, all arrivals must still quarantine in hotels as explained above. But those arriving from the rest of the world will now have drastically dferent rules depending onthey’re jabbed. Fully-vaccinated arrivals from the rest of the world now only have to take one test - a ‘Day ’ PCR test after landing. There’s no need to isolate, and no need to take a “pre-departure” test before flying. Unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated arrivals must take three tests - a pre-departure test, plus a ‘Day ’ and ‘Day ’ PCR test after landing. They must also isolate for  days at home or wherever they’re staying, unless they pay for a fourth ‘test to release’ test to leave isolation early. This is stricter than the previous system, where self-isolation wasn’t necessary for green list countries. All arrivals - vaccinated or not - will still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form ahead of travel.  Who counts as fully vaccinated  Anyone who had the final dose of a UK ‘authorised’ vaccine at least  days ago. These are Pfizer BioNTech, Oxford AstraZeneca , Moderna and Janssen . Those who received their complete course in the UK, EU or US get blanket recognition by the UK authorities. So do those whose first and second doses were split between two recognised countries, such as one in the US and one in Europe. For those jabbed in other countries, they need a digital or paper certicate from a public health body showing key details. These include full name, date of birth, and vaccine brand, manufacturer, date and country. The government says  countries’ vaccine programmes are now recognised by the British authorities including the UAE, Japan and Canada. Read more Will the red list be cut further  It seems likely. The red list was cut from  to  countries from September , removing the Males, Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Oman, Kenya and Sri Lanka. A further red list update is expected from the UK government this week, probably on Thursday. According to the Sundayit could cut the number of red list countries to as few as nine, opening up South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. But we’ve been here before - reports that previously claimed the red list would be slashed dramatically did not come to pass. Ultimately the decision will depend on an independent assessment that has not finished taking place.When will expensive holiday tests be scrapped  A big part of the change was cutting the need for expensive holiday tests for the double-jabbed. Some of this has happened already - from today, vaccinated people no longer have to take a pre-departure test onto the UK. But they still have to take an expensive PCR test on Day , and this is only being replaced with a cheaper “lateral flow” later this month. Officials hope the Day  test rules will be watered down in time for Brits ing from half-term breaks abroad. However, despite Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hinting we’ll know by October , there’s still no date for this to happen. And those lateral flow tests will still cost money - as the free ones you can get from pharmacies won’t qualy. Estimates have put the cost at £. Could all this be reversed later this winter  Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman refused to rule out the possibility of some restrictions ing on travel later in the winter,Covid surges. He replied: As a responsible government we will take necessary steps to protect public health. However, he added: “We are well placed to take further steps with regard to easing travel restrictions and indeed we continue to have one of the most open economies and societies in Europe and the G.

Mr Elliot joked back: Weaposll have no politicians left.  Tory chiefs force would-be candidates through a five-hour, £ whittling process called a aposParliamentary Assessment Boardapos. Those who want to sit in Parliament are subjected to psychometric tests looking at their aposcore beliefsapos, intellect, leadership and communication skills before they can be eligible for selection by a local party. But ConservativeHome reported party chiefs are planning to invite all those on the approved list for reassessment under a new procedure. The succession of elections in ,  and  - and Boris Johnsonaposs -seat majority - allowed far more hopefuls to become MPs than many thought.

Quintessentially subscriber and Tory donor Mohamed Amersi claimed in July that Mr Elliot arranged for him to meet Prince Charles - after years of subscription payments. Mr Amersi claimed at the time: “I call it access capitalism… You get access, you get invitations, you get privileged relationshipsyou are part of the set-up, and where you are financially making a contribution to be a part of that set up. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists found Mr Elliot did not need to register as a lobbyist, but it advised him “to be cautious about the possibility of engaging in consultant lobbying activityby not making a clear enough distinction between his role as a director of Quintessentially and his other activities connected to government.” A spokesperson on behalf of Mr Elliot said at the time: “The registrar has made clear that Quintessentially does not lobby Government and therefore does not need to register as a lobbyist.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonRoyal FamilyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson ’s party descended on Manchester this week for their annual conference.But the city’s metro mayor, Andy Burnham, expressed anger at the revelation, which contradicts the Government’s official reasons for blocking a probe. Pitmen have spent three decades demanding an inquiry into cops’ actions at the infamous clash at the height of the Miners’ Strike. Violence flared between officers and pickets at the South Yorkshire coking plant on June , . Mounted police launched horseback charges and baton-wielding “snatch squads” as , officers tried to prevent striking colliers blocking deliveries to the plant. South Yorkshire Police received heavy criticism over its conduct. A total of  miners were charged with rioting. But none was successfully prosecuted after the first cases collapsed through unreliable evidence. Former miners and their families demanded a Hillsborough-style probe to look at how South Yorkshire Police - the same force involved at Hillsborough - behaved before, during and after the  Battle. In , Amber Rudd, then Home Secretary, rejected a formal inquiry, saying there was not a sufficient basis for a review. But a book by the we of a Tory MP claims the real reason Ms Rudd scrapped the probe was because it would slur the memory of Thatcher and upset party members.Sasha Swire, the we of Tory MP Hugo Swire, says Ms Rudd made the admission during a kitchen supper on September ,  - shortly after Ms Rudd was promoted to Home Secretary by Theresa May. She wrote: She tells me she loves all the James Bond stuff, the MI and MI briefings. But Amberaposs immediate concern is the number of potential inquiries that need decisions on whether they go ahead. Most of them she inherited from her predecessor, who kicked them into the long grass. Orgreave would slur the memory of Thatcher and the party wonapost like it. The revelation was spotted by Mr Burnham, who said: Itaposs kind of an interesting and quite revealing read because it does reveal how this country is run, and how the other half who are running the country are living. He added: We suspected it at the time. In the House of Commons she said we wouldnapost have an inquiry into Orgreave because nobody died. Actually, behind closed doors it was about aposMargaretaposs legacy being tarnishedapos, and thataposs why everybody needs to continue to support the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign, because that will tell you how this country is run. A spokesperson for the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said: “We believe that Amber Rudd refused an Orgreave Inquiry because she was pressured by the establishment and heavily influenced by Tory ministers from the Thatcher era who would rather cover up the past than reveal and admit the wrongdoings of the past. The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign had corresponded and met with Rudd before she denied an Orgreave Inquiry. “At that meeting she implied there would be some type of inquiry but had not decided what form that inquiry would take. The group continues to campaign for a public inquiry.

Police were called to the Midland Hotel bar on Sunday night, after Clementine Cowton, the director of external affairs at Octopus Energy Group, said she was “violently assaulted in the conference zone by a man” who was very intoxicated. She said the man had invaded her space. “I was sitting down and he plonked himself down on the chair that had been vacated by a friend of mine and I asked him to leave and he refused to,” she said. “He was very intoxicated and I felt a bit unsafe around him, so I asked him several times politely to leave.” When he refused, Ms Cowton said she had taken his phone and dropped it on the floor to create space between them. After he picked it up, she said the man had tried to punch her but only managed to get as far as smashing a glass out of my hand. She said he had been immediately set upon by lots of people who stopped him from doing anything.” Around  minutes after the incident, she said, police came over and she reported it to them.  On Monday morning, a source told the Mirror: There was a bunch of young Tories in the Midlands bar last night and things got a bit heated. They added: It was really shocking. The police were called. But Greater Manchester Police initially said they were not aware of police being called to an incident at the hotel. They later issued a statement, which read: Police responded to an incident at the Midland hotel at around :am this morningto reports of an assault on a -year-old woman.

Speaking at a fringe event at the conference, according to the Times, Ms Cowton said: Women are often unsafe in places where other people feel safe, and it’s really important that we start to take that much more seriously as a society and, starting with the police. A Tory spokesperson confirmed the man involved was a party member and has now been suspended.

The Tory government is planning to strengthen the right to request flexible working from Day One in a job. But the former Northern Powerhouse Minister dismissed home working as a woke pastime.

Kent Live reports the home is hidden away just off an unassuming junction on the A south of Uckfield in East Sussex, and although the property was once the most expensive private house built in Britain, it has been abandoned for around  years.The home was designed for British multi-millionaire Nicholas van Hoogstraten, one of the wealthiest people in Sussex, but the property is unfinished and there is no sign that anyone will ever live there.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. But the mystery of Hamilton Place goes deeper than its unfinished shell – as it was even dubbed The Ghost House of Sussex. Curious adventurers can’t even get close to the mansion as it’s completely obscured by a thick wooded area, and the closest glimpse you can get on foot is of a gated entrance onto the estate. And evenyou do find a way through, you might not want to venture too far, as signs put in place warn of shooting in progress, dogs running free and CCTV being in operation.  There aren’t even many photos of the grand estate, with the most recent snaps being taken by drones and older ones taken on-site when work was still ongoing. The abandoned mansion has remained almost completely empty since work stopped on the development over three decades ago, but one reporter did venture inside in , when the property was said to be two years off completion. That reporter revealed the inside of the home featured a grand central staircase and reception hall, with lt shafts already installed and expensive stone balustrades and pillars. They also said space had been allocated for a fountain and a rooftop garden, as well as one entire floor that was due to house Nicholas van Hoogstraten’s art collection. The reason for leaving the property abandoned is unclear, but locals have previously had several disputes with Nicholas – who is now  and a convicted criminal who goes by the name Nicholas von Hessen – about the development. Residents have fumed over the large area being left unused, and also raised concerns about a public footpath that ran through it that Nicholas did not want to be used.The wealthy property magnate previously denied reports that the house is falling apart, stating: Hamilton Palace is far from aposcrumblingapos and was built to last for at least , years. The scaffolding only remains as a part of ongoing routine maintenance such a property would require until completion. It is thought the estate is now owned by his children through the company Messina Investments.

Mr Withers says the family are beside themselves and just want Pippa back home with their other dogs. He thinks there were around four people in the car - possibly two men and two women - and they were shouting and messing about on the farm before disappearing with the black and tan coloured dog.  By the time he realised what had happened and gave chase, they were long gone and the family would like to hear from anyone with information. Pippa was also stolen a year ago but was ed two days later after her theft went viral. Dad-of-two Ross is offering a large cash reward for information or her safeand said he canapost imagine how Pippa must be feeling. Iaposm just imagining how she is feeling right now. If she is shut in some cage wondering where I am, he said. I was looking at her seconds before while they were roaming around and then suddenly she wasnapost there.  My we was calling and I was whistling and she would usually come straight back from a mile away. There is no chance that she has run off or anything. I would put my childrenaposs lives on those people having taken Pippa. He said he watched the people the entire time but couldnapost make out what they were doing. Iaposm usually terrible for flying out there and confronting them. I did think, aposwhat are they doing apos And I could hear our other dog beneath me going berserk but Pippa had run straight over to them to see what they are doing, sheaposs so friendly. He continued: As soon as I heard my we shouting for Pippa I heard the penny drop, he said. I jumped in the car and went after them but there were so many cars and they were long gone. The family thinks that the vehicle may have been a BMW but it is not clear from the CCTV footage. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed it is investigating a report that a dog was stolen.

Despite realising it wasnapost his, Harling immediately set about spending as much as he could on luxuries and trying to hide it away in dferent accounts. By the time the Royal Bank of Scotland froze his account, heaposd managed to blow more than half of it.  The company who sent the money by mistake told him they just wanted it back and didnapost want to prosecute him but after being strung along by Harling, they eventually went to the police, the court heard. Now the -year-old, of Stuart Gardens, Throckley, Newcastle, has been given a suspended prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court after pleading guilty to theft. It was on January ,  that a mechanical engineering company based in Surrey sent £, to Harling instead of another company which was the intended recipient. On the same day, he moved £, to his then-partneraposs account and she transferred £, back to him. Thomas Parsons-Munn, prosecuting, said: A number of substantial purchases were made by her, including jewellery and a holiday. On January  Harling transferred £, from his current account into his savings account then withdrew £, in cash from ATM machines. In May, having been made aware of the issue, the bank froze the £, that was left in the account. The boss at the business then contacted Harling in October asking him to send the money back. Harling said he was a gambling addict and believed the windfall had come from winnings but that he was speaking to his bank and would send back what was left. In November, , a further £, was frozen by his bank and ed to the company. In total, £, was ed by his bank and £, remains outstanding. The court heard the trusted and respected finance manager at the firm, who made the one digit error, was so devastated, she insisted on quitting despite her boss pleading with her not to. She has been left extremely depressed by what happened. Harling, who has nine previous convictions, pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to  weeks suspended for  months with a three month curfew. Tony Cornberg, defending, said Harling is remorseful and heartbroken at the effect it has had on the finance manager. He added: The money landed in his account and temptation got the better of him.

With offices still lying empty and more people working from home, increased household waste means the critters are making their way into residential areas. Here, pest control experts explain how the desperate vermin, which have even been known to eat their young, are getting creative to infiltrate homes - and how best to stop them.Rats crawling up through loos and aposgnawing seatsaposBoasting a sense of smell that is even more powerful than dogs, rats manoeuvre their way through sewers seeking out pipelines with the strongest scents. The creatures are famously strong swimmers and will brave toilet U-bends to enter households. Peter Higgs, managing director of PGH Pest Prevention, told the Mirror he recently witnessed a case where a rat tried to chew through a toilet seat after crawling up a pipe.It had swam through the U-bend and chewed through the seat trying to get through to the living space, he says. The toilet seat was wooden, their teeth are as strong as steel so they can pretty much chew through anything.Mark Moseley, director of PestGone Environmental, says the problem has become a daily occurrence in callouts.On all the years Iaposve been on this planet Iaposve never had a rat personally come through my toilet, but I see it every day in the profession we’re in, he says. Every day we’ll have rats coming out of someone’s toilet.  With many businesses shut over lockdown, the job has also been made easier by owners turning off the water supplies to save cash. aposDry linesapos have been a major problem for the hospitality sector in particular and led to one restaurant suffering an infestation of  rats. Due to the pandemic they’ve switched the water off, someoneaposs flushed the toilet and that’s it, the water’s gone, Mark says. We had  rats in one restaurant. The guy couldnapost believe what was happening to his restaurant, all because of dry lines. Someone opened the door and they just ran out. Rodents turn to homes with offices shut With millions working from home, pest controllers warn rats have followed the increasing waste in homes. Peter says their sharp noses mean thatthey smell other rats thriving, they will follow suit.  If you have one or two rats in the house and they’re living successfully, other rats will smell that and think, aposOh where Iaposm living at House B, there’s actually a better place at House Aapos, he explains. Plastic sewage pipes are no issue for the rodentsapos razor teeth and moves to reduce bin collections by councils are also feared to have attracted legions of vermin.While the hardy creatures can survive cold winters underground, they also shelter in gardens and Mark warns the recent downturn in weather could force more indoors.  They could be seen possibly more in homes during the winter, he says. Sometimes they’ll live under people’s decking or sheds during the summer, but they wonapost want to do that in the winter. So then they come in and nest next to a heating system or up in the loft space next to an insulation system. Grim aposcannibalsapos force mothers out of sewers A chilling trend among urban rats is that, as the hunt for food becomes more extreme, they will even turn towards cannibalism. Bill Lane-Petter, a post-war rodent expert, reported back in  how malnutrition can cause a perversion in mothers that makes them eat their young. “This will lead her, as well as other adult or growing animals in the cage, to devour carcasses, and even to attack and kill the young in order to eat them, he said, as reported by the .In another grim development, the specialist suggested this can even develop as a vice. Whisker-eating in mice is not uncommon it can go on to ear- or toe-chewing, and, from there to total cannibalism.” Aside from sounding like something from a horror movie, this can have real-le consequences on the creaturesapos movement. Mark says females will often flee the sewers after breeding to protect themselves from males snacking on their young. Most of the rats live in the sewer lines to live and breed, he says. Females usually come and nest somewhere away from the sewers because the adult males eat the young. So the females will be seen in properties quite a lot. Fat rats gorging on fast food Thankfully, rats donapost primarily feast on each other - but rather turn to waste bins for an easy dinner. With takeaway and fast food culture taking hold over recent decades, however, it has led to reports of giant rodents terrying home owners. With the pests not having to work as hard for their next meal, Mark says theyaposre getting fatter and fatter - especially around bustling city centres. Itaposs the aposTV dinner on the sofaapos lestyle that means rats donapost have to work for their food, he says, adding that he once caught a creature near enough the size of a cat. They’re not burning it off because there’s so much food in London that they’re just physically getting fatter and fatter. The offspring will get bigger naturally as the bone structure has to get bigger to take the weight of these fat rats. With Britain tackling record obesity rates over recent years, unhealthy diets have also trickled down the food chain too. Peter explains that sugary foods mean the pests struggle to know when they have eaten enough - getting bigger as a result. When rats eat stuff like sugared buns and pastries, they donapost tend to understand, he says. Their bodies donapost register that they’re full so they keep eating, which does influence the size of a rat. They’re more likely to get biggertheyaposre eating all the fast food. To keep safe, Mark recommends installing a aposrat flapapos - a one-way valve in manholes that stops the creatures from travelling up sewage pipes into loos. Laying down rat poison alone wonapost stop infestations, Peter adds. They attract each other, so unless you change the environment, you’ll always continue to have rats, he says. Evenyou put the best poison down ever, it’s pointless unless you do proofing because they will come back.

Claire Vickers, , was left stuck on the slide for two hours with her shin bone poking out her leg and a shattered ankle, while her friend Barry Douglas, , broke his fibular and both ankles. The two had gone on a night of drinking on August , but it turned into what Claire said was the most horric experience sheaposs ever experienced. The pair broke into Aldershot Lido in Hampshire at am, thinking it would be good fun to go down the slide. After splashing water down from the top to generate extra speed, Claire and Barry stepped into the tube together, thinking that it was clear all the way down. But just before they came out the bottom, their legs collided with a barrier that had been placed at the exit. They were rescued after police called in to investigate reports of kids messing around in the pool. Claire said: I couldnapost think straight as the pain was excruciating. It was like a scene out of a horror film like aposSAWapos. Her right leg was completely broken so her shin bone pushed out of her skin, and she shattered every bone in her left foot. aposWhat are we going to do  What are we going to do apos was all I said for ages, said Claire. I was banging and banging and, as my foot was hanging off, I was trying to hold that up. Barry said: The pain was unbearable, it was one of the most horric experience Iaposve had in my le. The pair remained trapped inside the chute for nearly two hours, screaming in agony and sitting in their own blood. Eventually, they were rescued by three police officers who had been called by nearby residents reporting that kids had broken into the lido. Claire is sharing her story to prevent others from making the same mistake as her. She said: Iaposm still having nightmares about it now, one month on. I nearly went head first, I would have been dead. Mum-of-five Claire had been to the pub for four hours before meeting up with Barry at his house for some more drinks. At about am, she suggested that the two try breaking into the lido, that was only a five minute walk away, for a quick dip. Forklt driver Barry agreed and they crawled under the fence surrounding the swimming pool before leaping in. Tipsy Claire then suggested that they have a go on the long yellow flume slide.  They climbed over the slide gate and went up the stairs, before Claire sat down and Barry put his legs round her to slide together. As the water was off, Claire splashed some down the chute from the foot bath to make it extra slippery and to help get some speed. They raced down but, to their horror, saw that a barrier had been placed at the tubeaposs exit. Before they had time to react, both their legs smacked into it. Claireaposs snapped shin popped out of her skin on her right leg, and completely shattered her left foot. She said: Iaposll never forget what I saw. The blood was pouring out at this point and I was starting to feel faint and cold.  I kept checking on Barry but he stopped moving and making any noise, I looked over at him he was in the foetal position and silent, thataposs when I thought we were both going to die in that slide. I remember thinking no one is going to find us. Both Barryaposs feet and leg were also broken by the impact, and the two were crying out in pain. Barry said: I tried to lt my leg, but it was dark in there I could see my leg just folding. I thought I was going to die. Former bartender Claire tried holding her snapped leg together while banging on the tube and screaming for attention. Every time I banged I let go of my foot and my shin and more blood came out, she said. My foot was hanging down and looked totally unattached at this point. At :am, they saw the torches of three Hampshire Constabulary officers who received a call from concerned residents who thought kids had broken into the pool. Claire kept shouting for help until the officers looked over the top of the slide and saw them trapped behind the barrier at the uncovered portion at the bottom.  They called for paramedics who lted them up over the side of the slide and into the ambulance. They were taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley, but their injuries were too severe for treatment there, so were transferred to St Georgeaposs Hospital in Tooting. She woke up in hospital to find her her daughter, Elle, , sobbing over her with sister Shannon, . Claire said: The pain in her eyes haunts me. I could hear Baz in the next cubicle shouting out in pain while the doctors worked on him, thank God he was alive. I have never felt pain like that ever in my le - and Iaposve given birth to five children. Every movement I made I could feel every bone in my leg crunching.  Both my legs were in full bandages at this point and I really thought I wasnapost going to wake up with my foot, so I guess that was a bonus. Claire remained there for two-and-a-half weeks recovering, having a metal rod bound to her right shin, and plates put in her left foot. She is out of casts now, but still canapost walk for another six weeks, and Barry has been moved to temporary accommodation where he can recover. Claire and Barry hope their cautionary tale will dissuade others from doing the same thing. Barry said: Iaposll be luckyI ever get to go near a water slide in my le again. Even thinking about going past that place gives me nightmares. Claire added: Donapost do it - weaposre idiots, I still have really bad night terrors about it, in the beginning I was waking up within seconds of going to sleep.There should have been gates at the top shutting the whole thing off, there needs to be more safety.No police action was taken against either Claire of Barry but details of the incident were provided to the land owner of the Lido by officers who attended.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsSwimming pools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlie Butler, , was out for dinner in Sunderland and was sitting at a nearby table to the woman when he heard what he initially thought was an altercation occurring. But when he realised it was more serious, Charlie rushed over to Trish Malin as he is first aid trained. Trish was panicking along with her friends at the table, so Charlie, after introducing himself, performed abdominal thrusts on her. The third thrust dislodged the blockage to her throat.Charlieaposs heroics didnapost go unnoticed by Trishaposs husband and indeed the restaurant owners, who bought him and his friends a round of drinks to say thank you, according to the Newcastle Chronicle. Charlie, who lives with his partner Emma and six-month-old daughter Amelia in Roker, Sunderland, said: It was so scary but also humbling. Iaposve been thinking about it none stop since it happened. It just shows how being first aid trained can be the dference in saving somebodyaposs le. She could have, and probably would have, died. I am proud of myself. The operations manager was with a group of friends and hadnapost even had a sip from his first beer of the night when he realised something was going on at Trishaposs table. He continued: There were two men and two women and one of the women was frantically hitting the other on the back. I went over and there were tears rolling down the face of the woman. Her face was getting redder and redder. Her friend was crying and shouting please help her.  People were around but nobody was doing anything. I went up to the woman and askedshe could breath and she shook her head. I then quickly introduced myself and told her I was first aid trained. I told her Iaposm going to put my arms around you and do abdominal thrusts, which Iaposll do on the count of three. I then started doing the thrusts and whatever was in her throat came out after the third one. To hear her then take a breath was such a relief. She sat down and just cried. Afterwards, Charlie immediately went back to his friends before going outside to calm himself down and ring his partner. Charlie went on: Five minutes later, they came over and thanked me and the womanaposs husband bought us a round of beers. The restaurant owner did too. It was all so surreal. The whole thing happened in  to  seconds, from realising she was choking to getting what was stuck out. It just shows that first aid training costs pennies but it really can save somebodyaposs le. Trish, meanwhile, aged  and also from Sunderland, naturally was full of praise for her saviour. Thank God he was in Goa at the time. He is a hero in my eyes and I canapost thank him enough.

The clip quickly went viral online, with several people commenting and sharing it. A viewer wrote: This video is a perfect example of why supermarkets need to stop selling pastry out in the open like this. Itaposs not just the rats itaposs the flies too. Do you have any similar footage from a supermarket  Email webnews@mirror  Another said: I can’t believe what my eyes are seeing. One more added: I mean, they’re everywhere… but this is particularly gross… Another shopper said they would never buy loose bakery items again. Mr Mitson posted another video today showing a sign outside the supermarket telling customers the shop is closed. The sign reads: This store is closed at the moment. Sorry for the inconvenience. A Sainsburyaposs spokesperson said: We are immediately investigating with the store.In , a mum-of-two told of her horror after she found a live rat trapped inside a sealed packet of plums she had bought from Aldi.Salma Riaz, , and her husband, Kamran, bought the punnet of fruit but failed to spot the rodent curled up in the plastic container, covered with netting. In July , a Tesco customer filmed a large rat scurrying around a supermarket. Danielle Westbrook, , dumped her basket and ran out of the shop after spotting the rodent. The gran-of-three told The Mirror: I let out an almighty scream. It’s appalling and disgusting. Now I feel angry. I’m never ever shopping in there again. It’s made me feel sick to my stomach that I have ever eaten food bought from this store.

On top of this, the £ Universal Credit uplt, intended to help people through the pandemic, is going. Leaning over his balcony, smoking, a man stares out at the rain bouncing off the block of flats facing his. By his side sits a woman still wearing her dressing gown, despite it being way into the afternoon.  Neighbo A washing line is strung across the front door of the flat below, towels billowing in the wind and getting soaked. When asked by the Manchester Evening Newsthey fancy a chat about the problems the country is facing, they shrug we donapost speak English - but the dejected expressions on their faces say it all. Down on the street, Damon Watters, , who lives opposite them in Uvedale House, off Cawdor Street in Eccles, has a sunnier demeanour. Rushing off to visit a friend he tells us he likes to keep positive, keep smiling and have fun every day. But, despite his happy-go-lucky aura there things on his mind. The petrol situation is a pain in the a**e, he said. I have a grandmother in Droylsden and she doesnapost have anyone to do her food shopI canapost get petrol for my bike. He also worries about the food shortages. There is The Mustard Tree food bank in the middle of Eccles. If there are food shortages it might be affected, he said.Me and my Mrs have had to go to foodbankswe are struggling financially. A few of the lads I go in the pub with have had their Universal Credit cut, I buy them a pintI can.They just try to have a bit of fun with what they have left. For the most itaposs alright here. It looks a bit rough but itaposs alright - we have a bit of banter with the police when they turn up.  Roy Bannister, , a retired UPS worker, has lived at Uvedale House for over  years. Heaposs dreading the prospect of food shortages and the rise in his energy bill. I imagine it will be hard and it is probably going to get worse, he said. I get my pension and I donapost get anything . I went on Sunday to the supermarket and it opens at am. I got there at .am and waited for an hour. I canapost just go now, I have to plan ahead as you could go and have  people in front of you. When I went out the other day the whole road was blocked up with people queuing up for petrol at Morrisons petrol station.If I canapost get petrol and the weather is bad it can mean I canapost get out. I have not had a bill yet for my gas - God knows what that will be.Why do they just put it up  Itaposs not our fault - itaposs crazy. Iaposm just about managing at the moment and I guess I will find out when I get the bill just before Christmas - Great. In the next block along at Uvedale House, Vicky Derbyshire, , unemployed, says she has been looking for a job since lockdown. Bewildered to be asked, she says with surprise: People donapost normally ask us how we are, or how we are feeling.  Vicky, who has learning disabilities and was widowed last year, has lost her disability allowance and says she is managing on Universal Credit. She says she has got used to budgeting a small amount of money, but sometime uses Mustard Tree Foodbank. The prospect of food shortages, the benefit cut, and energy prices increasing weigh down on her. Nobody wants that, she said. I have been looking for a job since we came out of lockdown but a lot of places have shut down. Across the road, just off Trafford Road, are blocks of high rise flats, built in the s and given a £.m makeover in . Resident Shirley Kearney, , is a nursing assistant at the Moor Side Unit at Trafford General, lives at Engels House. During lockdown she was shielding due to health issues and says she was paid her basic wage without enhancements - such as extra pay for weekend work and late nights. As a result she was losing £ per month, but she says she was not eligible for Universal Credit. You work hard all your le, and it is a simple no. she says. My wages went down but my financial commitments still remained the same. Had Shirley have been able to claim Universal Credit, she says the £ uplt would have covered her electricity for a week. Concerned about the hike in energy prices, she says she attempted to get a smart meter, but was told it wasnapost possible because of the position of the meter and the wi-fi signal.She says she blames the government and Brexit for the food and petrol shortage fears.No other countries are suffering like us, she said. They arenapost having all these problems with food going off the shelves and fuel shortages. Itaposs clearly down to Brexit. The government thinks we are thick. Shirley says she worries about the younger generation. What are they going to university for  she asked. But she also feels pensioners and taxpayers are getting a raw deal. We have suffered by having to wait until  to retire now instead of  and now they are insulting us by making us pay .% to the NHS. I feel well ripped off by the government. Itaposs not getting any better, itaposs getting worse. I think pensioners are being penalised. I feel like everything is getting worse.... it just feels like a very bleak future. Rebecca Watson, , works in hospitality and lives at neighbouring Wade Court with her grandparents. As a teenager she says she isnapost yet feeling affected by any changes, but she worries about her grandparents. It concerns me that there might be a lack of food in the future, she said. If there is no petrol my grandad will not be able to go to work, there will be no income and you get in a massive cycle of not being able to do what you want to do. Seven miles away in Miles Platting, residents of Butler Court raise similar concerns, reported the Manchester Evening News. Former Merchant Seaman Michael Bancroft, , said: I got into debt with Universal Credit. My benefits stopped and I was not aware of it. Michael, who is a full-time carer to his ex-we, says that having his benefits stopped while universal credit was being sorted out left him six months in rent arrears and £, in debt. After all, that Michael says, he was eventually told he was not eligible for Universal Credit and put on the state pension. His ex, who is eligible, will lose the £ uplt. Another worry on Michaelaposs mind is the rising cost of gas and electricity. I was led to believe we could make a change with our supply of gas and electric, but we have not been able to change or get a smart meter. People still feel isolated in the tower. It is like a ghost town, it was not great even before Covid - people just sat around like zombies. Nobody lets on to each other or says hello - Itaposs like, aposwhat are they after apos I made a few friends here but I later found out they had died, and nobody had told me - so I didnapost get to go to their funerals. I am not happy with the way it is going at all. Annette Strain, , lives on the th floor. Sheaposs not optimistic that le will get any easier. Things are just getting worse, she said. Nothing is any better. And these problems are not going to go away. They are here forever now.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family.

It was announced that Kate was pregnant with Prince Louis in September , two months before Prince Harry and Meghan revealed they were engaged to be married. This meant that while much of the wedding preparations were taking place, Kate was pregnant. She only gave birth to Prince Louis just weeks before Harry and Meghanaposs big day in May . And in an updated edition of his unauthorised biography, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Andrew Morton writes that this meant the two women had little time to get to know each other. He explains: Kate and Meghan were neither sisters nor, unlike Fergie and Diana, friends before they joined the Royal Family. What is more, during the build-up to Meghan’s wedding, Kate was experiencing her third dficult pregnancy and was focused on her own welfare. She did not have much energy to bond with her new neighbour. When they sat together in the royal box to watch the Ladies’ Singles Final at Wimbledon in July , the two women were still getting to know one another. During the match, in which Meghan’s friend Serena Williams lost to Angelique Kerber, they chatted and clapped and cheered.

Click here to sign up .Unlike Wimbledon , when the cameras focused on Pippa Middleton and Anna Wintour and ignored the unknown American actor, this time they were fixated on the duo of duchesses.After their joint appearance at Wimbledon, reports surfaced that Kate was left sobbing amid a disagreement with Meghan at a bridesmaidsapos dress fitting before the wedding. Princess Charlotte was one of the bridesmaids.However, during her bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, Meghan said the reverse happened and she was left crying a few days before tying the knot with Prince Harry.Claiming it would not be fair on Kate to go into details on what happened, Meghan simply stated during the tell-all chat there wasnapost a confrontation and an apology was made. Andrew also claims after the Wimbledon appearance there was little opportunity for Meghan and Kate to develop a friendship away from public events. He adds: It was a practical matter as much as anything. Kate spent weekends and holidays at Anmer Hall, the Cambridges’ country home in Norfolk, while Meghan and Harry were approximately three hours’ drive away, living in a large, remote, rented property on the Great Tew estate in Oxfordshire. Harry’s dream of two united happy families seemed a long way off.

The -year-old went to a dermatologist in Mannheim, Germany, due to the red patches that had developed on the back of his hands and arms and he later found the worrying diagnosis that it was leukaemia cutis. Tests done at the hospital showed that he had a high white-cell count along with a low number of platelets, it is reported.The case was published in the New England Medical Journal where it said that a diagnosis of leukaemia cutis was made.While extremely rare, the condition means that the leukaemia cells are in the skin tissue. It is found to happen in around three percent of leukaemia cases where the rash has been found on skin including the arms, back or face.  Other leukaemia symptoms include fever, tiredness and susceptibility to infections. But in the case of the -year-old in Germany, he only had the rash on his hands and elbow. The New England Medical Journal stated: A diagnosis of leukemia cutis was made, and the patient was urgently referred to the oncology clinic. The patient received a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and underwent stem-cell transplantation. Two weeks after the transplantation, the patient’s skin changes had resolved, and the cancer has been in remission since. Leukaemia Care UK said that usually patients who have the cancer and find rashes do not have this particular condition. It stated: “Leukaemia cutis is very rare, occurring in only about three percent of total cases of leukaemia. With this in mind, it is unsurprising that most lesions seen in leukaemia patients are not leukaemia cutis. “In fact, most lesionsseen in leukaemia patients are caused by other complications of leukaemia.” It continued: “In the rare occasion that leukaemia cutis occurs, the patient will normally have already been diagnosed with leukaemia. However, in seven percent of cases of leukaemia cutis, the skin lesion is the very first symptom of a blood cancer.

The victim was left unconscious and close to death after the appalling attack, a court heard, after being set upon because he defied a warning not to be seen again in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire.Another victim was also injured during the fracas, suffering a cm wound on top of his head, HullLive reports. George Halliday, , Jeremy Wilson-Wetherill, , Guy Saleh, , Ryan Cooper, , all from Bridlington, and a -year-old Bridlington youth, who cannot be named because of his age, all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent during the horric attack on August  last year.  Cooper also admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent to a second victim. The court was told all five were wearing disguises and Halliday had previously made a serious threat to the main victim. Halliday was jailed for  years and nine months, Wilson-Wetherill for nine years and  months and Saleh for six years and nine months. Cooper was sent to a young offendersapos institute for six years and the teenager was given four-and-a-half yearsapos detention. Peter Byrne, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court that the main victim visited Bridlington and went to a flat but his presence there became known to Halliday, who had warned what might happen to himhe was spotted again. A group of five hooded or masked troublemakers went to the house after .pm and Saleh kicked the door open and forced entry.  The victim escaped upstairs but was chased upstairs by Halliday, and was beaten with the baseball bat repeatedly during the two-minute attack. He was left lying motionless, bleeding from his head and ears, before ambulance crews were alerted. Paramedics rushed him to Hull Royal Infirmary unconscious, making incomprehensible noises, where doctors found he had suffered multiple fractures to the base of his skull and bleeding on the brain. Doctors needed to feed him through a tube for months after the attack as his injuries were so severe. Since then he has struggled with day-to-day le, often forgetting things, falling off balance, and now suffers from night terrors and anxiety. He said: It stops me going out. My le has not been easy. I am struggling to stay on my feet longer than  minutes. It is almost like being drunk. It stops me living a normal le. He added: This has affected not only me but my family.  Wilson-Wetherill and Saleh had convictions for assault, Halliday had been jailed for two-and-a-half years for wounding and had an assault conviction. Cooper had a conviction for possessing an imitation firearm. Sentencing, Judge John Thackray QC said: It was an appalling group and armed attack which involved an element of trespass. It was almost certainly related to drugs. It was only good fortune that he survived. This could so easily have been a fatality. This was a pre-planned and premeditated attack in which all five of you played a signicant role, either by inflicting injuries or adding to the force of numbers. Your attack has had a profound effect on him. Itaposs unlikely that he will fully recover. You were extremely close to causing his death. Cathy Kioko-Gilligan, mitigating, said Wilson-Wetherill claimed that he picked up a brick and wanted to scare the victim. He was not in possession of any weapons, she said. This defendant bitterly regrets getting involved in a situation that he clearly did not know the full picture of. He met Halliday only that day. Halliday was a friend of one of his sons. Had he been fully aware, he would never have attended. When they did arrive, clearly the incident escalated. He has stayed out of trouble since and has turned his le around. Michele Stuart-Lofthouse, representing Saleh, said: He apologises for his behaviour, which he has had much time to reflect upon. He is remorseful. She said, for Halliday: He would wish to apologise. He is doing all he can to rehabilitate himself. Timothy Jacobs, representing Cooper, said: He was very much at the tail end of what went on. He knows that what went on in that house was wholly unacceptable.

The emails included one mistake-riddled message which read: Take your response and shove it up your f**king a**hole. Another stated: Frankly I think you should get some work done rather than talk about language you f**king hypocrites. Knott, whoaposs own MP is Emily Thornberry, said he suffers from PTSD after the death of his quadriplegic partner Nicholas Walker because they saw demons coming out of the walls of their home.

He told the court his white blood cell count fell below  because of the sleep deprivation and suffered pneumonia due to his AIDS. Knott, of Dalston, denied but was convicted of two counts of harassment without violence. Sabrina Felix, for Knott, said: The defendant was previously illiterate. He has now begun, and continues to receive, literacy lessons in reading and writing so when he was sending those emails they were one liners, most of them, because he dictated the emails rather than typing them. So he used the emails more like a text service, sending one line at a time. Knott was offered a caution when he was first arrested, but refused. Knott received an eight week community order, meaning he will be on a tagged curfew between the hours of pm and am. He was ordered to pay £ in court costs at a rate of £ every two weeks.

Teacher Louise Lavery, , from Blackpool, Lancashire, couldnapost muster more than a strangled squeak when she woke up on the day of her sonaposs graduation. Louiseaposs speech issues first cropped up seven years ago while working as a religion and philosophy teacher. The busy mum thought she had just been speaking too much until her voice started to break more often. She eventually went to a consultant who told her to look after her voice and to take up speech therapy. In July , Louise was travelling to her sonaposs graduation when her attempts to speak caused spasms in her larynx. Every time I attempted to speak my larynx would go into spasms and the noise I made was either nonexistent or a strained, strangled squeak, Louise said. It was very distressing and the more I attempted to push it out the worse it would become. I hoped and prayed that my voice would , but it didn’t. Louise saw a voice specialist who diagnosed her with laryngeal dystonia, a chronic voice disorder caused by spasms of the muscles of the voice box.

I could manage the basics but anything more is too much of a struggle. I do have some good days and moments where my voice will be audible, although the spasms are ever-present. The condition is incredibly isolating as the effort required to speak, often overrides the need, so I remain silent. One of the hardest things for Louise was not being able to speak to her five children - Lucy , Luke , Jack , Leah,  and Leo, .  She said: It was dficult when I lost my voice as all of our children were at quite pivotal points in their lives, so either going to university, leaving university, taking exams, etc. I just wasn’t able to speak with them, or advise them, or help them in the way that I wished to. When your children are struggling, or making important decisions you just want to be able to encourage them, or just chat. She started undergoing treatment, which involved injecting botox into a thin muscle in her neck. However, the treatments are risky asthe positioning is not precise, it can cause her airways to become blocked. On two separate occasions, Louiseaposs airway has closed and she has been taken to hospital unable to breathe. With the risks involved, Louise realised that botox injections were no longer an option and she decided to look at other forms of treatment. Louise - who had to give up her job due to the condition - found a study in the US involving trial medication. She had to raise £, to travel to the states for the Hard University trial - a target she hit in just over a month with the help of friends, family and former students.  The money allowed her to travel to Canada two weeks ago and she is due to start the trial soon. She said: What really humbled me were not only the amount of family, friends and my parish church community who helped us but also many of my former students heard about the story. They shared messages about how I’d help them achieve their dreams and the impact I’d had on their education, it was truly overwhelming. It was largely down to their efforts that the journey has become possible. These students are now adults and to think that they still appreciate the work I did then is truly astonishing.  She added: Losing your voice doesn’t sound that bad. However, the loss that accompanies this is truly devastating, the loss of job, the loss of self, the loss of being able to simply chat with friends and family. Your voice plays a huge part in who we are and I don’t think people realise this, until it’s gone.

A lot of people don’t necessarily see the work that we do here, but it’s predominantly to maintain firefighters’ competence.”  The training at Chelveston is tactical and will see whole time and on-call firefighters visit twice a year to take part in training programmes run by a team of eight instructors and supported by two training support technicians. The practical courses include search and rescue, where fire fighters are forced to navigate in dark conditions, extinguish fires, identy casualties and exit safely. And there’s compartment fire behaviour training – the highest risk exercise that exposes them to very high temperatures so they can learn gas cooling techniques. Other skills taught are in tactical ventilation and using fans to remove hot fire gases. New recruits undergo an intense three-week Breathing Apparatuscourse, which is run four times a year. This course is one of the toughest, both physically and mentally, and takes them all the way through to being confident to wear the BA gear, understand the risks with flashover and backdraughts, and how to cope in tough conditions. The rigs at Chelveston act as an introduction before they head off to join their new stations and revisit every year to maintain their skills. Before being used by Northants Fire, Chelveston was a Royal Air Force and United States Air Force base used in-case of emergency during WWII and the Cold War. “People come from across the country to join Northamptonshire Fire  Rescue Service,” said Watch Manager Instructor Chris Westfield. Chris himself transferred from London Fire Brigade in , where he dealt with large-scale incidents including Grenfell Tower. He added: “We recently had some whole time transferees and they did things such as RTC familiarisation and flashover training. Dferent services use dferent breathing apparatus, so they have gone through training with our BAs now and they have also done ultra-high-pressure training. “We make sure that we treat on-call the same as whole time when they visit us – they are firefighters and they should have the same training and safety. “Ultimately for whoever comes in we try to create, as best as we can, work related scenarios. The facilities we have here at Chelveston are far greater and advanced than a lot of other services, even down to the training rigs here. “You speak to a lot of people nationally and they either have rigs that are very limited, or no training at all and they go to other services to train. But here we have these fantastic multi-floor units whereby we can create several dferent scenarios to help people be as safe as they possibly can.” Comment MORE ON Fire ServiceFire\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As of September  there had been  cases of the iant recorded in the UK. Two weeks later that number had more than doubled to .  Globally the number of cases has shot up from  to  over the same time period, although the true number is likely much higher.The Delta iant is now the dominant strain around the globe and has been reported in  out of  World Health Organization member countries. The strain has some features which make it more resistant to Covid vaccines, although two jabs typically give % protection against hospitalisation. The new mutation has the potential to be more resistant against the jabs, although it is currently unclear how signicant the dference is. While the strainaposs spread is too limited to be certain, one outbreak over the summer gives reason to be hopeful that the vaccineaposs defences will remain strong. A group of fully vaccinated pensioners in their late s and s in Lombardy were infected with Delta plus EK in July. Only one of them was hospitalised, suggesting the jabs may hold up well against the mutation.The outbreak is detailed in a research letter published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases , entitled “Breakthrough Infections of EK-Harboring SARS-CoV- Delta Variant, Lombardy, Italy”. Until July, neither Delta nor any of its sub-lineages carried the EK mutation. The mutation is present in the Beta iant first identied in South Africa, but that strain did not have the same high level of contagiousness as Delta. Last week, Public Health England said it had designated Delta with EK as a “signal under investigation” but added: “We constantly monitor all data relating to SARS-CoV- iants in the UK and abroad. “Delta with EK is not a Variant Under Investigation or a Variant of Concern at this time. When cases are identied, health protection teams are informed so that they can take actions appropriate to the epidemiological situation.” Comment MORE ON DeltaWorld Health OrganizationCoronavirusCoronavirus Explained\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Weaposve had a look over some of the more interesting and shocking claims.  aposUnspoken codeapos Morton has become the latest in a line of experts and insiders to claim the Queenaposs heirs photo upset Meghan and Harry. To mark the start of , the Monarch shared a lovely photo of herself with Charles, William and our youngest future king - Prince George.  It was taken in Buckingham Palaceaposs Throne Room, and laid out the future of the British Monarchy as well as being a cute family photo. However there has been much speculation that the snap caused upset behind palace walls. Morton says Meghan and Harry saw the picture was unspoken code about their royal future, saying they suspected the entire institution was conspiring against them. Kate had aposno energyapos and Meghanaposs post-spat gt The book also touches on Meghan and Kateaposs relationship, something that has been of huge interest to fans. While royal watchers hoped the women would become strong friends, countless reports over the years suggests there have been tensions - with one insider simply saying they are very dferent.The book claims that Kate didnapost have much energy to get to know and bond with Meghan in the lead up to the Sussex wedding as she was going through a dficult pregnancy with Louis. Morton also claims that despite the tensions and much-discussed row between the women at a bridesmaid dress fitting, Meghan bought Kate a bracelet to thank her for the wedding preparation help.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Morton describes the gold piece of jewellery, by Calornian jeweller Lisette Polny, as an elegant peace offering. He writes: The spat concerning the bridesmaids’ outfits now behind them, Meghan had since given Kate and her six closest friends gold bracelets designed by Calornian jeweller Lisette Polny as a thank-you for their help and support. Prince Harryaposs acupuncture and Queenaposs brutal put-down The lead up to Meghanaposs wedding to Harry is also covered extensively in the book - including the supposed disagreement over the tiara Meghan was going to wear on her big day. Morton claims Harry needed acupuncture to stay calm in the run-up to the wedding and was overwrought when the chosen tiara could not be made instantly available for Meghan’s hairdresser Serge Normant, who had flown from New York to work on the hair fitting. Morton says The Times reported how Meghan threw a tiara tantrum shortly before the wedding.  He writes: In November , just days after the couple ed from their successful tour Down Under, The Times reported that Meghan had thrown a ‘tiara tantrum’ shortly before her wedding because the tiara she wanted to wear was not available.Her prima-donna behaviour apparently earned a rebuke from the Queen herself, who told Harry: ‘She gets what tiara she’s given by me.’ Morton also claims Prince Harry was irate when Meghan did not get her way.He continues: The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof Her Majesty’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate Prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece. Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. Refusal to name Archieaposs godparents left Prince William aposperplexedapos After their wedding in May , Meghan gave birth to son Archie a year later, which according to the book merely reinforced their desire for privacy. When it came to the babyaposs christening two months later in July  at Windsor Castle, Harry and Meghan refused to make public the names of the people they had chosen to be Archieaposs godparents. And according to Morton, this left Harryaposs brother Prince William perplexed.He writes: The decision to keep the names of the godparents secret was another issue, one of many, that perplexed William. He, like others inside the family, felt that those chosen to guide and counsel a future royal prince, seventh in line to the throne, should be identied. Harry and Meghan thought otherwise. They explained that the godparents were genuine friends, not celebrities or public figures, and had joined with the royal couple in preferring privacy. Prince William aposbreathed a sigh of reliefapos when Meghan and Harry took break In September , Harry and Meghan embarked on a tour of South Africa taking young Archie with them.And a documentary later revealed the strain the couple had been feeling during that tour.In it, Prince Harry admitted to having a rt with William saying they have had “bad days”.  Harry said: “Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under ­inevitably, you know, stuff happens. “But look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers. At the time, a royal source said senior royals were “concerned for the couple”. And Morton writes: Like many others, Prince William breathed a sigh of relief when Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from royal duties for six weeks or so and spending Thanksgiving and Christmas in North America. The couple ended up in a remote luxury mansion on Vancouver Island loaned to them by a patriotic Canadian businessman. Palace aides, who had been urging the couple to slow down, were pleased to see them take a breath. Meghan and Harry were driven out by Williamaposs alleged aposbullyingapos attitudeOne of the more shocking claims in the book is that Williamaposs alleged bullying caused a rt between the brothers.Morton writes: The Duchess of Cambridge’s coolness towards Meghan, and William’s alleged bullying contributed to a devastating ‘Cain and Abel’ fallout between the brothers. Harry was the ‘prime mover’ in souring relations between the Sussexes and the Royal Family, but it was Meghan who ‘took the hitapos. It has always been strongly denied that William bullied his family members. Last year, the brothers said they were deeply, deeply unhappy about bullying claims. The rare joint statement read: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between The Duke of Sussex and The Duke of Cambridge. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.” Diana is aposthird wheelapos in Harry and Meghanaposs marriage Mortonaposs other famous book is his biography of Prince Harryaposs late mother Princess Diana and she is mentioned throughout the biography of Meghan.And he claims that Diana is a third wheel in the coupleaposs marriage and that her ghost” looms over the couple’s lives and defines their view of the world. He writes: The ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales loomed large over the lives of Harry and Meghan. She was essentially the third wheel in their marriage. Not a day went by without a reference, a memory or, perhaps more importantly, a decision relating to Harry’s beloved mother. Morton also claims family friends of Meghan have said she “wants to be Princess Diana .” and, aged , was deeply moved while watching Diana’s funeral with tears “coursing” down her cheeks. According to one childhood friend, Suzy Ardakani, Meghan would watch old videos of the  wedding of Diana to Prince Charles and the two girls – inspired by Diana’s humanitarian missions – collected clothes and toys for less privileged children. Suzy’s mother Sonia even gted Meghan a copy of Diana’s biography and it reportedly stood on her bookshelves for several years. Meghan found some members of the royal family unfriendly and jealous Another claim in the book is that Meghan found some members of the royal family unfriendly and jealous of her. Morton writes: It was clear that Meghan had ruffled feathers in the family and that they felt she and Harry were very dficult to deal with.  For her part, Meghan found some of its members – not the Queen or Prince Philip – unfriendly and jealous.At a personal level, then, their departure from Britain was quietly welcomed by some in the Windsor family and their courtiers, but on an institutional level it was a heavy blow. Harry made small steps to bridge rt with Prince Charles when he learned he had Covid Like many, Prince Harry was shocked when he learned his father Prince Charles tested positive for Covid- in March . And that along with his brother also having the virus, it saw them bridge the distance between them. Morton says: While Prince Charles’s condition was made public, with the Prime Minister very seriously ill, Prince William, who also contracted the dreaded disease, decided that at a time of national crisis he should keep his diagnosis a secret. Later reports suggested that the prince, although fit and healthy, was struggling to breathe. Harry’s phone calls to his father and brother helped in a small way to bridge the distance between them. He also contacted his grandmother to wish her luck before she made her historic and highly emotional ‘We Will Meet Again’ speech from Windsor Castle.Andrewaposs Mortonaposs updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess is on sale online and in bookshops across the country from October .Comment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He also claimed a rather impressive memory by insisting on the exact date in question he could remember he had been at a Pizza Express in Woking. But with no discernible income - how could the -year-old possible even afford a suit for the trial Well, according to the , Mummy has saved the day and agreed to pay for Andrewaposs defence fund.The Queen has reportedly financed Randy Andyaposs legal battle from the beginning of last year using her annual income from the Duchy of Lancaster estate - which recently increased to £ million.  But siding with her son - in spite of his friendship with one of the worldaposs most notorious pedophiles - will be costly. Last week Andrew added Melissa Lerner to his legal team, the latest Lavley Singer lawyer to come on board after Andrew Brettler, who is said to be charging ,an hour as Andrewaposs lead counsel. Now, £, may seem like nothing to a family worth hundreds of millions: itaposs like the average person donating the p change from their McDonaldaposs to charity. No, the real cost will be a blow to the Queenaposs popularity.  As Britainaposs longest-running monarch, Queen Elizabeth has dedicated her le to the throne and subsequently earned the publicaposs adoration. But, the Firmaposs reputation is on thin ice - and the Queen is no exception. Attitudes are changing towards the monarchy, as seen in the  YouGov poll which found  percent of those aged  to  thought there should now be an elected head of state compared instead of a king or queen.

Mick responds: You canapost  Oh thataposs fine. What is your view on this story  Have your say in the comments  She answered: Sorry my lovely. Mick replied: aposThataposs fine. No worries. Leaving the pub, he told those watching: Well there you go. Weaposre getting thrown out. We canapost sit in here like this. Weaposll go and find another establishment, Iaposm sure they will help me. Once outside, he added: I couldnapost even get a cup of coffee, but there you go. Itaposs alright, what can you do  That was a bit of a bummer wasnapost it  I was just about to get some hot soup and they knocked me back. Weaposll just have to stomp on and just donapost worry about it. What can you do, aye  People were outraged that Mick had been kicked out, with one person saying: I think it is absolutely disgusting that Speedo Mick was refused service and told to leave. They continued: All the work he has done for charity doing these walks he was soaking wet hungry and freezing cold and they threw him out back into the rain and cold without any food or drink.

Apparently they allow dogs in but not a man in Speedos doing a walk for charity, shocking! The red-faced bosses of the family-run pub issued a statement on its Facebook page after the incident, and wrote: We are so sorry and embarrassed we did not know who you were Speedo Mick.  We would happily donate to your good cause. In another post the pub wrote: We are sorry we asked a gentleman to leave today we did not know who he was and we have a dress code policy within out business. We have and still do lots of work for charity. If we had known who he was andhe was visiting us we would have helped raise money for this amazing cause. Mick filmed another Facebook Live video this afternoon asking people not to contact the pub or leave any bad reviews.  He wrote: Afternoon everyone, Iaposve just had to jump out the way, the Fashion Police just flew past me! Itaposs defo the meffaposs cell for a few tonight!Iaposm alright you beautul people, allaposs good no hard feelings here at all Itaposs not the first time Iaposve been chucked out of an ale house it happened on the last walk too.

They said aposweaposve got a strict dress codeapos - are you having a laugh or what  You shouldaposve seen the people in there, the clobber! He added: It doesnapost matter and itaposs just all part of the journey, there you go. Phone the fashion police! And in a further post he wrote: In all seriousness folks, letaposs be kind.

Jenni Medlam, , and husband Richard, , were delighted by the birth of baby Isla-May in June after being told the unexpected news by their daughter Charmaine.

When we explain to them that we are actually grandparents they get the absolute shock of their le. Most people donapost believe us when we tell them. But I can obviously understand why people would think we are her parents as we are still in our early thirties.  When Charmaine first told her parents that she was pregnant, Jenni - who was  when Isla-May was born - admits they were really shocked. However, after coming to terms with the news, she now says they are both loving their new roles. Iaposm Nanna and Richard is Gapospa, she says. Being young grandparents just means you have more time to love your grandchild and longer to cherish them. And we might even get great-grandchildren. After becoming a teenage mum herself, Jenni - who also has two other daughters, Chy, , and Scarlett,  - didnapost have a support network to help her through it and she was very isolated. Jenni didnapost want her daughter to have the same experience as she did and vowed to support her. I knew exactly how Charmaine would be feeling having to tell her mum she was pregnant, she says. But I told her itaposs her body and her decision and I would support her either way. And since falling pregnant it has really made Charmaine grow up, Isla has been the making of her. She is an incredible mum and I think it has made the bond between Charmaine and me even stronger. I think she has even more respect for me now as her mum Charmaine has been with her partner, the babyaposs father, for nearly two years and Jenni says their whole family all live under one roof together. The loving grandparents regularly look after little Isla to give Charmaine a break. I think itaposs brought us all even closer, she adds. My other girls absolutely love having a baby in the house, they love having a niece. Jenni, who runs her own cleaning business, thinks that teenage mums are stereotyped but insists that having a baby doesnapost mean your le is over. She says that although she was a teen mum, she was still able to work and bring up her daughter, and even start her own business. Charmaine has watched me go to work and do well for myself while bringing her up, so she knows itaposs possible, she explains. She wants to go to college and do beauty. There is a stereotype about young mums which I donapost think is fair. You can still enjoy your le and achieve whatever you want evenyou have a baby when youaposre younger.

Humberside Police have confirmed that the man was a police officer and have apologised for his conduct. The woman is speaking about the experience as greater attention is turned towards police behaviour in the wake of Wayne Couzensapos sentencing for the murder of Sarah Everard. Ms Everard was kidnapped by Couzens using his police-issue badge and handcuffs. Thinking she was under arrest, the -year-old got into his hired car before she was abducted and murdered. The Hull woman recalled how she encountered the silver Land Rover at around .pm on Thursday, September . There was a silver Land Rover up ahead that I moved to overtake, there was no way to know it was a police vehicle, she said. Before I could overtake him he flashed a little set of blue lights that were down the bottom near the tow bar so I slowed down. He was going  in a  so I slowed right down to match behind him but he kept putting his arm out the window to wave me to overtake him. I slowed down because I didnapost want to be caught speeding, when we got to the first roundabout he just carried on doing the same thing, arm out the window telling me to go past. He kept doing it right up to the Marfleet Roundabout and just before he slowed right down to try and go behind me. He was flashing his indicators trying to get me to pull over. I changed lane and he was following where I was moving, indicating the whole time. A couple of bikers had noticed what was going on and pulled alongside him and looked into his car. They immediately dropped back to start following me so I got an idea that something wasnapost right, I ended up side by side with the Land Rover and he just didnapost react.  He was there in a high vis just looking at the road. Youaposd thinkyou were trying to pull someone over youaposd wave at them to go to the side of the road or something but he didnapost even look at me. The woman says sheaposs been left enduring sudden moments of panic since the encounter. When I gotI was shaking like a leaf, just the way he was it all just seemed off, she continued. The bikers told me theyaposd spotted he wasnapost in unorm and didnapost have the equipment theyaposd expect so hung around to see what happened. I called the police straight away to tell them about it and I got a message later on to say aposnot to worry it is an official vehicleapos. I thought that isnapost really the point so I called them again the next day to ask why I was being pulled over or asked to pass, what he was doing and why wasnapost he in a marked car or unorm. I got a call later that day to tell me that it was an inexperienced officer and he shouldnapost have been in that vehicle and that it wouldnapost be happening again as he wouldnapost be out in an unmarked car like that. The woman called the police who later told her aposnot to worry it is an official vehicleapos.  When she phoned again the following day, someone explained to her that it was an inexperienced officer who shouldnapost have been in that vehicle and that it wouldnapost happen again. When asked for an official comment, a Humberside Police spokesperson said: We received reports of suspicious activity on Hedon Road, Hull, at .pm on Thursday,  September, involving a person trying to flag down a motorist. We can confirm this was a police vehicle and the officer left the scene soon after as he was called away on police business. We understand the call was of good intent and would like to thank the person who reported it for showing concern for a fellow motorist. In an updated statement a spokesperson for Humberside Police confirmed the driver had been a serving police officer aposundertaking specic police dutiesapos at the time of the incident. They said they understood the womanaposs concern and offered to have a senior officer talk to the woman. They also praised the passing bikers for showing concern. A spokesperson for the force said: “Following inquiries, we can confirm that the lady’s account aligns with that of the police officer driving the vehicle. The officer was undertaking specic police duties at the time of the incident. “We understand how this incident could have caused concern and want to thank the person who reported it for showing concern for a fellow motorist. “We would welcome the chance to speak to the member of the public involved and to reassure her of the officer’s actions.” The incident comes as police try to react to the fallout from the horric events that led to the murder of Sarah Everard by Couzens, a serving Met officer which has placed intense scrutiny on how they interact with the public and in particular lone male officers with women. Humberside Police have suggested that people shout out, flag cars down or call they are concerned by an officeraposs behaviour. They said that some of their officers do work alone, particularly those in unorm or more specic roles, however it is very rare for plain clothes officers to be alone. They saidthey are alone, they should be calling for assistance with other officers arriving soon or will have other officers stationed close by. They said that every police officer, including our Specials and plain clothes officers, carries identication with them and can explain to you who they are, what they are doing and why.

Beckett Burge became an internet sensation when a photo of him alongside sister Aubrey went viral. The heart-wrenching image showed the then three-year-old being sick over a toilet in  during his battle with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Mum Kaitlin spoke of how little Aubrey, now seven, would rub his back, clean his face and wash her brotheraposs hands.  The strong youngster would even carry her younger brother in her arms and place him on the sofa when the tot was too weak to walk. Two years on, six-year-old Beckett, who is now back at school, rang the end of the chemo bell last week, with nurses joyously singing next to him. But the mum-of-three admits Aubrey still plays the role of protector - claiming the duo have formed an aposirreplaceable bondapos. Kaitlin, from Princeton, in Texas, US, said: Aubrey had such a huge impact on helping him get through this. They developed a bond that only siblings have that I couldnapost even replace. When he was going through chemo she was more of a motherly figure, but Aubreyaposs starting to notice that now heaposs off it, heaposs wanting to be a bit more independent.  Sheaposs struggling with that as heaposs now found his inner voice and any time she tries to help him he says aposI can do it by myselfapos. Itaposs a change for her because sheaposs not used to that. Theyaposre starting to bump heads and he can fight back a bit, whereas before he didnapost have the energy to do that. Last night, he got sick and she was there standing behind him, still holding him so he wasnapost vomiting and landing in it.  She was holding him then getting him hand sanitiser saying aposput this on your handsapos. We got him home, went and got his PJs and got him cleaned up. Sheaposs still a big help and he notices sheaposs been the strong one, so he goes to her for a lot of it. Even though they sometimes fight now, in reality thataposs welcome. While Beckett has spent most of his early childhood in cancer treatment, he has always had his big sister Aubrey to turn to. The young boy was forced to take chemotherapy pills every night and needing regular hospital treatment, always with Aubrey eager to help comfort him at home. But the family breathed a sigh of relief when he was given the all clear and ringing the bell last week.  Kaitlin said: When we heard heaposd got the all clear, it was so exciting. His oncologist came in and said aposno more chemo - weaposre done. Get rid of everythingapos. He rang the bell last week because he had Covid. Luckily, he was asymptomatic. He had no symptoms at all. She added: Beckett was shocked . His face lit up but then he said he didnapost want his port out because he knew itaposd kept him alive. He has a bit of nerves. Heaposs officially done with it and it is a bittersweet moment. You think youaposll be all happy but now itaposs kind of scary because you donapost have that chemo as a reassurance the canceraposs going to stay away. Itaposll be a whole new world. Beckettaposs great. Heaposs in a much better place now. Heaposs happy, heaposs more of a normal kid now. He can do the things his friends are doing. Heaposs playing baseball.  He doesnapost have a lot of restrictions now and can go out and do as he pleases. Beckett is now finding his feet again and has ed to school where he is excelling, while Aubrey has ed to her own hobbies that were previously stopped due to the financial strain her family were under during her brotheraposs treatment. Kaitlin said: The last two years, heaposs been going through the day-to-day chemo heaposs been on. He was taking the nightly chemo pills and going in for treatment, then on August , they stopped all chemo. He was done with treatment. Heaposs going in once a month of labs but you never know - itaposs a dferent world. He struggled educationally with the chemo. He was really foggy brained and didnapost understand a whole lot. He got everything twisted up. Now, itaposs interesting to see. We were sitting at the table the other day and he was reading. I thought aposyou know how to read  Whataposs going on here apos You give him a spelling word and heaposll spell it all. Weaposre seeing more of a normal kid - things we never thought heaposd ever do. Itaposs really cool and boosts his confidence. Heaposs also got the side effects of the chemo that heaposs dealing with. Heaposs got leg pain and struggles a little bit. Overall, heaposs happy. When he gets his port out in two weeks itaposll be the icing on the cake for him. They can play as normal siblings now. I walk with them in the morning to school but theyaposll bike home together. Theyaposre outside playing together and being kids now. Aubreyaposs now on a competitive cheer team.

My husband and I are in the process of adopting two cute little twins that will be born in January, the -year-old explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. The biological mother is a -year-old girl, G, who doesnapost want to keep them. Sheaposs the daughter of a friend of a friend of ours and somehow it got through that we wanted to adopt so her family called us as soon as they knew that G was pregnant.  The couple have been with G all throughout her pregnancy and have assured her that even though she doesnapost wish to be a mother to the twins, she can still be a part of their le and visit them whenever she wants, as theyaposll all be living in the same city - despite the fact the teen has shown no interest in having a relationship with them at all so far. As soon as we found out about the baby, we began looking for names and when it was confirmed that it were going to be twins, a girl and a boy, we decided on the names Ellie and Evan, the woman continued. Last week however, we were informed that G had chosen names herself Walter and Agnes. She didnapost choose them because of a relative, just because she thought they sounded cool. I donapost think I have to mention how outdated the names are and my husband and I simply donapost like them. The mum-to-be added that eventhe name chosen by G were great, theyaposre still hers and her husbandaposs children and they will be raising them, therefore itaposs their place to choose the names.

They will also get our last name and legally be our children, which was decided and agreed on five months ago, she continued. Gaposs family is upset with us for not accepting their aposrealapos names and is threatening to look for new parents. The mum explained that while she was considering naming the girl Ellie Agnes to appease the family, there was no way she would ever name the boy Evan Water. Although it appears to be empty threats from Gaposs family, the woman turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in putting her foot down when it comes to naming their adopted babies. Youaposve done nothing wrong, but this is a big red flag. Are you sure you want to have an open adoption  If they’re willing to argue about the kids names, they’re going to be all over you about other things also, one Redditor warned. I think you need to look at it from the bio moms perspective. She is giving you a really big gt. Regardless of practicality, opportunities etc, these are her babies. Naturally she would want to give them a name, itaposs practically the only thing she will ever be able to give them, another suggested. You will be the ones to comfort them, you will be the ones to cuddle them, you will be the ones there for every milestone. I understand hating the names, but I would try to either keep them as middle names or talk to her and seeyou can come up with better names together.

Matthew Rutherford, , was the passenger in a car that was involved in a high-speed collision, and now he canapost speak as he suffered brain damage as the result of the crash. He lives in supported accommodation in Derby, with his trusty companion Chips the cat, and to pass the time over lockdown Matthew began painting, as the Derbyreports.Now his dramatic work covers every inch of his flat, and Matthew has been compared to Picasso by the art galleries that stock his work. What do you think aboutMatthewaposs incredible artwork  Let us know in the commentsUsing a special app on his phone to type, Matthew said: I couldnapost read, talk or write so I did drawings as a way of communicating. Dr Andrew James from the Nuffield Hospital, who was my doctor when I was in residential healthcare in Leeds, taught me how to paint feelings and thoughts. Painting helps me to communicate feelings and thoughts. Matthew says his paintings - which he calls aposArt from a Locked-In Mind - aim to show how he feels and each work represents a story or a memory, with many of them venting his frustration at being unable to communicate as he once could.

The dad-of-one paints using several sorts of paints and colours, including oils and acrylics, and covers canvases of every size. With a brush, a cigarette, a cup of tea and Chips by his side, he paints almost every day and sometimes will complete a painting overnight, sometimes getting only three to four hours of sleep. His flat is covered with several finished pieces of work both big and small, but he maintains incredibly high standards and any artwork he is not happy with is quickly thrown away. He added: My family are very proud, and my dad feels very proud, and I feel happy about it too! When Iaposm painting I just imagine seeing my work in a book. I want to let the world see my work.  With the help of Headway, a brain injury charity based in Derby, Matthew is now set to have  of his works exhibited at the Derby Museum and Art Gallery on The Strand in October.Previously, his work was showcased in a virtual exhibition at the Brick Lane Gallery in London in September . One staff member at Brick Lane said of his work: Every time I look at it, I canapost help but think Picasso.

In the video, which has since amassed . million views, Bev begins by liberally spraying her hair with leave-in conditioner, before brushing out any tangles.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Then, she grabs two socks - but not any old socks. Bev says they have to be big, fluffy socks as not only do they give you those beautul loose waves, but theyaposre also comfortable to sleep in, which is a must. Once sheaposs ided her hair into three sections, the first from the hairline to the ear, she takes the sock and begins to wrap the hair around it a couple of times before grabbing the second chunk of hair. She wraps the hair twice more, then incorporates the final section of hair.  The reason why I only like to do it in three and not in four or more is that it gives me more of that big bouncy blowout type of curl, she says. She continues wrapping the hair around the sock until she reaches the bottom, before stretching the opening of the sock up and over the hair to secure it in place. Repeat this process on the overside and youaposre ready for bed. When you wake up in the morning, gently unravel the sock from your hair to reveal gorgeous curls. Since being posted, the video has been liked more than , times and has received almost , comments from people thanking Bev for sharing the simple - yet le-changing - hack. One person said: Wait this looks so easy, thank you. Another wrote: I did not just see this at am and get out of bed just to try it. A third revealed: Iaposve been doing this since last March, itaposs amazing my hair has gotten so long and healthy because of the lack of heat damage. Omg this looks so much easier than the bathrobe curl method, said someone .Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Niki was on the flight to Chicago to surprise her boyfriend of one year for his birthday when she came up with the idea to pose as an Amazon employee. Dressed head to toe in dark clothes, which she accessorised with sunglasses, a face mask, a hat, and gloves she walked up to her boyfriend and handed him a parcel and a letter to sign which said: sign here lil b**ch. After signing for his goods, he thanked her and went to walk back indoors until he noticed Nikiaposs sister recording from behind a parked car. At which point he starts laughing, thinking that the letter he had to sign was the prank.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Niki can be seen hysterically laughing too, but it seems he didnapost quite get the joke. She ended up playing the part so well, that her boyfriend had no idea who she was. From behind the camera, Nikiaposs sister asked who is that  but he just shrugged and said he was so confused. Eventually, Niki took off her disguise, leading her boyfriend to burst into laughter and hug her.The video, which later went viral on TikTok @niki.bayatwith . million views, was captioned: Disguised myself a little too well...  Since being posted, the video has racked up hundreds of thousands of likes and comments from people who said they let this go on for way too long. One person said: Bruh. I donapost know why this is so funny to me. Another wrote: THE WAY HE STARTS PLAYING WITH THE BOX BECAUSE HE DOESNaposT KNOW WHAT TO DO. A third commented: I was like girl take your mask and hat off of course he doesnapost recognise you. This was literally so painful to watch, said a fourth. Meanwhile, a woman who travelled the distance to surprise her boyfriend was forced to defend her relationship after his reaction caused TikTok users to believe he was being shady. In the clip, a friend leads the girl, Lauren, into the apartment where her boyfriend Robbie and his friends were. When he noticed her walking over to him, he kind of stared at her in shock before she pulls him in for a hug.A number of people in the comments were quick to come up with theories about what Lauren really walked into - take a look at the footage here.Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

For two years, a -strong team of reporters organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalistshave been pouring through the . million leaked files, finding and verying stories which are being published this week.  The files, shared by  sources, are believed to be the biggest leak of their kind in history, and name more than  politicians from  countries as well as  billionaires.and BBC have led the UKaposs investigation, which have named a number of high-profile politicians and world leaders. Here the Mirror looks at some of the biggest stories so far. Tony Blair saved Stamp Duty worth £, on London officeFormer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his we Cherie Blair are among those named in the papers, after they came to own a £. million office in Marylebone which Mrs Blair uses for her firm Omina Strategy. Normally, a commercial purchase of a £.m property would rack up £, in Stamp Duty. But the bill was not incurred because rather than the townhouse itself being sold, the British Virgin Islands-based firm which owned it - Romanstone International Limited - was bought by the the Blairs. The pair have furiously denied wrongdoing after their financial arrangements emerged in the Pandora Papers.  The Blairs quickly shut down the offshore company that had owned the townhouse, and the townhouse is now owned by a UK company which Mr and Mrs Blair jointly own. There is no suggestion any rules or laws were broken, although the sale highlights a loophole which has allowed wealthy property buyers to not pay a tax which ordinary Brits must pay. A spokeswoman said: The vendor was an offshore company. The Blairs had nothing whatsoever to do with the original company nor those behind it. The vendor sold the company not the property - again a decision the Blairs had nothing to with. Since the purchase was of a company no buyer would have had to pay UK stamp duty on that transaction. However, because the Blairs then repatriated the company and brought it onshore, they are liable for capital gains and other taxes on the resale of the property which will signicantly exceed any stamp duty. For the record, the Blairs pay full tax on all their earnings. And have never used offshore schemes either to hide transactions or avoid tax. King of Jordan amassed £million property empire across UK and US Jordanaposs King Abdullah, a close ally of the United States, was alleged to have used offshore accounts to spend more than  million on luxury homes in the United Kingdom and the United States. The nation is currently the recipient of a substantial amount of international aid, including from the US and UK, although lawyers for the king said he used his personal wealth to buy  homes in the two nations since he assumed power in . It also comes as he faced unrest at home over policies of austerity measures and tax rises, with protests taking place.  The leak comes a year after Jordinian authorities announced a crackdown on money being sent abroad by its citizens. DLA Piper, a London law office representing Abdullah, told the consortium of media outlets that he had not at any point misused public monies or made any use whatsoever of the proceeds of aid or assistance intended for public use. The royal palace has said King Abdullahaposs ownership of the properties was not a secret, but concerns over privacy and security were behind the reason for not disclosing them. Major Conservative Party donor involved in one of Europeaposs biggest corruption scandals A major Conservative Party donor is among those named in the leak. Mohamed Amersi, , has given nearly £, to the party since , but the papers allege he was involved in one of Europeaposs biggest corruption scandals. The corporate lawyer is alleged to have worked on a series of controversial dealings for Swedish telecoms company Telia which was later fined min a prosecution in the US. Mr Amersi reportedly advised Telia on a £m deal with the daughter of Uzbekistan’s former ruler Islam Karimov – a payment which US authorities later described as a “bribe”.  Telia later accepted that the money given to Gulnara Karimova was a “corrupt payment”. Mr Amersi’s lawyers have denied he “knowingly” helped facilitate any corrupt payments and had “no reason” to believe the money given to Ms Karimova would be a bribe. They added that the plans for a deal were already in place two years before he became involved. They said underlying arrangements for the deal were in place two years before his involvement.The leak comes as the Conservative Party gather in Manchester for their party conference, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledging to scour the papers for evidence of tax avoidance.Mr Sunak, who is very wealthy, has denied ever benefitting from an offshore arrangement. He told Sky News: “No. I haven. I’ve seen these things overnight … and of course HMRC will look through those to seethere’s anything we can learn.” Shakira used offshoreentities in the British Virgin Islands to conceal assets The Hips Donapost Lie singer is accused in the papers of setting up offshore entities in the British Virgin Islands. The -year-oldaposs lawyers have said she declared the offshore companies, and said their existence did not provide tax advantages.  Shakira is already in a legal dispute with the Spanish government, which has accused her of failing to pay taxes in Spain in the years ,  and . The singer has said during that time she was not a resident in Spain and was living in the Bahamas. In July, a Spanish judge ruled there was sufficient evidence to try her for evading more than £million in taxes. Azerbaijanaposs ruling Aliyev family secretly gathered UK propertyThe Azerbaijan ruling Aliyev family have been accused of secretly gathering UK property using offshore bank accounts. The files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought  properties, including an office blockin  for £million. However, one month later was transferred to their -year-old son Heydar Aliyev.  The research also revealed how another office block owned by the family nearby was sold to the Crown Estate for £m in .

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning.

This included him having a relapse when we thought we might lose him.He was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition and needed a long course of treatment and regular blood tests but thankfully he pulled through.Sadly, Red’s story is not an isolated case. Many animals arrive with us when they are literally broken.Some have suffered for a long time, carrying physical and emotional scars. Animals can’t tell us where it hurts, why they’re sick or why they’re scared.It’s our job to uncover what has happened to the animals and what treatment they need.Red’s happy ending is the best possible outcome for us. To see the broken animals which arrive with us go on to loving forever homes. It’s the reason we do what we do.We don’t just fix broken bones. We fix broken hearts too.The Scottish SPCA receives no government funding and is entirely reliant on donations from the public.To find out more about our Broken campaign and becoming a member of the Scottish SPCA, visit www.scottishspca.org brokenanimals.Jo Neilson, Scottish SPCA senior vet"},{"url":null,"title":"action packed day for young soccer stars","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

There are so many acronyms, andyou donrsquot learn them all you wonrsquot understand anything  further on.The part of the training that Peresild liked the most was a flight imitating weightlessness, in which a plane goes into a steep e to allow those inside about  seconds in zero gravity.She added that she realises that zero gravity in orbit could be completely dferent and is gearing up for her first morning in orbit.vw,vw,px, px\"Actress Yulia Peresild ldquoSome mornings could be dficult, even on Earth, she said. ldquoWe thought a lot about it, and cosmonauts shared some le hacks.Shipenko, , has made several commercially successful movies, including Kholop, a  movie that set a Russian box office record.

There were two lighthouses at the harbour entrance: one on a northern clf and the other to the south. These were intended to guide vessels through the portrsquos channel which had dangerous sand banks on either side.ldquoBut heavy rain prevented The Starrsquos crew from seeing the lights properly and there was a breakwater to be avoided before the harbour could be taken.ldquoOn entering the port, a huge wave bore down on the boat, threatening to throw it onto the breakwater.ldquoThe crew took what evasive action they could but, sadly, the boat was dashed against the masonry pier with such force that she quickly broke up with the tragic loss of all the crew but one.An active search was made but none of the bodies were reportedly found at that time.Almost five months later, the body of the skipper was found by fisherman William Cross, washed ashore at Dunwich, on March , .Newspapers reported at the time of memorial services being held in Musselburgh and visits made to grief-stricken families by the provost.Stuart Ritchie said it was believed that the skipperrsquos body was the only one found.He said: ldquoAfter a good deal of searching over a period of time, recently I found my great grandfatherrsquos death certicate.

It captures an imagined moment in which the legendary Viking Althamer sails along the coast of the Firth of Forth.It is the work of Andrew Hillhouse, an artist who sadly died in  at the young age of . I wish I had been wise enough to seek him out and talk with him about history and his art when Irsquod had the opportunity.His widow Vicky has told me of his modesty, that he wouldnrsquot call himself an artist because he was a working man with a job to pay the bills. He once wrote that he was ldquostill just a guy who likes to doodle in his spare time.Some doodles! His art is stunning: full of historical detail and atmosphere, and his work portrays many aspects of Scottish history, which was one of Andrewrsquos passions.His website has many more examples of his art, with short explanations to accompany them.He grew up in Prestonpans and knew the local legend of the townrsquos beginnings that it was founded by a Viking traveller named Althamer, who was shipwrecked with his crew on its rocky shore after a ferocious storm about a thousand years ago in the th century.As Andrew himself wrote: ldquoStories from this period are very dficult to very, but the legend persists to this dayhellip the image shows Althamerrsquos ship passing Bass Rock as the sun sets on the evening before their hard landing on Scotlandrsquos shores.But although this is a legend and not history, we do know that there was Viking activity around East Lothianrsquos shores in the th century. For example, it is recorded that the Norse king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson, raided Tyninghame in AD and died soon afterwards.And perhaps he lies buried there. In , the farmer at Auldhame, Mr Dale, ploughed up bones. An archaeological dig took place and an Anglo Saxon monastery was revealed. A male skeleton was discovered buried there with items that identy him as being a high-ranking Norse warrior.It canrsquot be said for sure the skeleton was the remains of King Olaf himself. But itrsquos a fascinating possibility.The thing is, we have tiny historical glimpses of this time, with archaeology sometimes adding to our knowledge while also sometimes adding to the intrigue.To this, we can add the stories, told down the generations, at the firesides of the common folk. These stories often had their origin in an account of someonersquos experience, or a memory of an event, which then evolved to become part of folklore and legend.Since the story of Althamerrsquos arrival was set in a time of extensive Norse and Danish settlement, the idea of Prestonpans being founded by a shipwrecked Viking is not entirely fancul. There was, after all, a Viking settlement a few miles down the coast at Luffness, by Aberlady Bay.So Andrewrsquos image of Althamer and his crew sailing to their fate along the East Lothian coast is now part of the telling of this legend.The story lit my imagination and interest in history when I was a youngster growing up in Prestonpans. It still does.Irsquove often stood on its shore in a storm to watch the waves crash against the rocks in a rage, and see in my mindrsquos eye the Viking longboat being smashed.There is so much in this picture for you to discover, and it speaks more words than I can write.So I will leave it with you.It is produced here with thanks from Vicky Hillhouse, who gave her permission to use it on this page.But she has also kindly given permission for its use by local schoolchildren, who are now the younger custodians of the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1996-1971-1921","story":"lsquoFEAR of cuts in hospital servicesrsquo was front page news in the East Lothian Courier on September , .Fears that local hospital services could be under threat to release cash for new hospital building in Edinburgh have led to a top-level meeting with Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.Labour MP John Home Robertson, local councillors and health officials say they are seriously concerned by reports that, in the run-up to using private finance, Lothian Health Board will run down services such as day surgery at Roodlands Hospital, Haddington, where the casualty unit has already been withdrawn.And the MP promised ldquofierce resistancecuts to vital services were proposed.He was joined by East Lothian Councilrsquos social work chairman David Costello and Roodlands consultant Dr George Rhind for last weekrsquos meeting with Lord James at the Scottish Office.Mr Home Robertson demanded assurances about plans for the new Royal Infirmary at Little France as well as existing hospital services in East Lothian.lsquoBILLY the beer drinking budgie diesrsquo, The Haddingtonshire Courier of October ,  sadly reported!Regulars at the Plough Tavern, Haddington, were disappointed to find an empty cage in the bar last week.

He advocates that we ldquodo better and even that is a dficult theme to address without raising hackles, but I would like to develop the theme with a couple of practical suggestions as to how we might do better.Please consider not waving or supporting the waving of the Union Flag in demonstration against citizens of that same Union. It is our nationrsquos flag and its current appropriation by one side of the national debate clearly serves to deepen the cracks in the very Union which its bearers profess to support. Of course, the same applies with reference respectively to the Saltire and harmony within the Scottish nation.Please consider not voting in tribalised blindness for or against the dissolution of the Union in which many of ourselves or our forebears looked for and, for the most part, found better lives but, instead, look at the real issues and make your own inidual and rational choice according to your judgment of these issues.It seems to depend upon whether we are more motivated to crush those with whom our people disagree rather than to strive to find a rational outcome in which people of dferent views might be able to invest for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole. The current direction of travel identied by Mr Mackay should surely be abhorrent to people of decent mentality and I offer the above rather obvious suggestions as possible steps in a dferent direction.Michael Sheridan, by Strachur, Argyll.PARTISAN ACRIMONY TO BE DEPLOREDWILLIAM Loneskiesuffers from the political myopia which afflicts the British iety of nationalist and can see nothing good about Scottish independence. Mr Loneskie is quite wrong in saying independence supporters write to The Herald every day ldquogirning about how bad the UK is. A quick review of recent letters pages shows the majority of independence correspondents do not criticise the UK at all. Instead they are exposing some of the nonsense spouted by unionists who appear to want to do Scotland down at every opportunity and seldom answer points made by those whom they appear to hold in contempt.I do not criticise the UK needlessly, there is much to like. After all, it is the only thing Scottish independence supporters have known and some have done very well for themselves, but huge numbers of our people have not and their prospects continue to be bleak. The question to be asked is: is Scotland as an equal partner in the United Kingdom best served by a future of continuing decline or is it time toto our former status but now as a modern independent country where we control our own destiny  The fact is we have so much to offer, the UK simply cannot afford to let us go and instead of being honest with us, we are portrayed us a begging bowl nation ndash it is the UK way of things, just as in India in the days of Empire.Mr Loneskie lists a number of benefits of being part of the UK but what is his point  An independent Scotland would have done the same most modern countries do and sometimes better. Certainly the vaccine has been a success story and I have heard only praise from independence supporters and unionists alike. Naturally less fortunate people from all over the world are keen to live in the UK as they also do in huge numbers in Germany and other European countries too. It is unfortunate in this constitutional debate there is such misinformation and partisan acrimony.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.WE NEED A NEW ACT OF UNIONI AM in wholehearted agreement with GR Weirthat the Labour Party has been negligent in not creating its own constitutional project since  ndash and indeed I have made exactly that point on a number of occasions in these pages. As Dan Jarvis says: ldquoIf you donrsquot talk about a subject, your opponents dominate the agenda.For the record, my preference is to start from the obvious place ndash the status quo which has been endorsed by the SNPrsquos own referendum, and to create a New Act Of Union. However, this should also include a new unilateral right for any part of the Union to secede, subject to a level of support similar to that expected as best practice by other countries and organisations. This could be either a supermajority, such as the two-thirds required to change the constitutions of everything from the United States down to the SNP, or double majorities as required for Swiss national referendums. Or perhaps both, to be certain that independence really is the settled will of the people ndash such safeguards would also show that the lessons of the Brexit debacle have been learned.So Gordon Brownrsquos commissionis to be welcomed, and hopefully it will spur the nationalists into creating their own new proposal, which will tell us exactly how independence will come about, how much it will cost, who will pay that price, and how long we will suffer its consequences. Without that proposal, we are stuck with the rather pathetic wishful thinking of ldquoit canrsquot be any worse and the unsupported ldquofiddlesticks assertions which we have to suffer all too frequently in these columns.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.TESTS HAVE NOT BEEN PASSEDJOHN Shankswrites that, for him, \"the road to independence is a series of tests that need to be passed\". He could have equally said that staying within the present Union is a series of tests that need to be passed, and I would contend that they havent.Mr Shanks tells us that he is in his twenties, so I presume that he probably cant remember a time when all issues affecting Scotland were made at Westminster and there was no Scottish Parliament, albeit with limited powers, democratically elected by the people of Scotland. However, he can certainly remember a time, because he and the rest of us are living through it, when there are still many crucial decisions affecting Scotland which are made at Westminster by a Government Scotland did not elect, and it is worth noting that of all the parties in the Scottish Parliament, only the Tories have never participated in a Scottish government.The hard fact is that we are currently suffering the consequences of being dragged out of the European Union by a Tory government, despite Scotland voting heavily to remain, while the end of free movement is perhaps especially harmful to Mr Shankss generation. It speaks volumes that the latest opinion poll shows that  % of Scottish voters think Brexit has gone badly.An independent Scotland wont cure all ills overnight but it would take Scotland out of Westminsters hands and it would be entirely the choice of Scottish voters to elect the government of whichever political hue they wanted, and to sack itit failed to deliver. The future would be within Scotlands hands to make and shape a modern European nation of which Mr Shanks and future generations could be proud. Independence is normal for almost every other country in the world, and Scotland needs to take the right road to become a normal country too.Ruth Marr, Stirling.PLAN FOR FAIRER, MORE EQUAL SOCIETYIrsquoM a nationalist born and bred Irsquod love to see an independent Scotland before I kick the bucket but unlike Brexit I donrsquot want to be presented with a pig in a poke. Simply transferring all the powers of governance to Holyrood without a substantial change to the social order and distribution of wealth saying goodbye to the old boss and hello to the new one, would be a complete waste of time. Maybe rather than banging on about independence ad nauseum,the roadmap to a fairer, more equal society were presented to the electorate the prospects of leaving the Union may seem more attractive.David J Crawford, Glasgow.TRUTH BE TOLDKEVIN McKennasimply puts a modern slant on an old theme.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Itrsquos like finding a lock and now we know the precise keys that will be necessary to unlock it.Prof Marin said the discoveries opened up ldquoan entire field of pharmacology and that researchers were already working to develop drugs to target the receptors they identied.He predicted that new treatments for pain would probably come first, but that knowing how the body detects changes in pressure could eventually lead to drugs for heart disease,scientists can figure out how to alleviate pressure on blood vessels and other organs.Last yearrsquos prize went to three scientists who discovered the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus, a breakthrough that led to cures for the deadly disease and tests to keep the scourge from spreading though blood banks.The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and a prize of more than one million US dollars. The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prizersquos creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in .The prize is the first to be awarded this year.

But I think that once we achieve the goal, all that will seem not so dficult and we will remember it with a smile. vw,vw,px, px\"The crew members pose at the Russian launch facility Peresild said it was dficult for her to adapt to the strict discipline and rigorous demands required during the training.ldquoHere on Baikonur, we made friends with everyone and all people warmed up, she said. ldquoBut it was quite dficult in the beginning, when you arenrsquot given much choice: Just go, run, go faster, hold on, carry on. It wasnrsquot easy for us and it was quite unexpected, but we have gone through it.She said learning about the design and handling of the spacecraft was the most challenging part of the preparation for the flight.ldquoIt didnrsquot come easy for me, to be honest, she said. ldquoFor the first two weeks, I was learning it until four in the morning every night. There are so many acronyms, andyou donrsquot learn them all you wonrsquot understand anything  further on.The part of the training that Peresild liked the most was a flight imitating weightlessness, in which a plane goes into a steep e to allow those inside about  seconds in zero gravity.She added that she realises that zero gravity in orbit could be completely dferent and is gearing up for her first morning in orbit. vw,vw,px, px\"Actress Yulia Peresild ldquoSome mornings could be dficult, even on Earth, she said. ldquoWe thought a lot about it, and cosmonauts shared some le hacks.Shipenko, , has made several commercially successful movies, including Kholop, a  movie that set a Russian box office record. He also described the training as tough.ldquoOf course, we couldnrsquot make many things at the first try, and sometimes even at a third attempt, but itrsquos normal, he said.One of Shipenkorsquos previous films, Salyut-, told the real story of a challenging  mission of two Soviet cosmonauts sent to resuscitate an abandoned space station.He described the four-month training course as very intensive, adding that while it did not turn him and Peresild into professional astronauts it made them well prepared for the mission.Shipenko said he is thrilled to be the first filmmaker in space and is keen to experiment with lighting, camera settings and other technical aspects. Once on the space station, Shipenko said he will don a T-shirt that he always wears when he begins to shoot a new movie. vw,vw,px, px\"The crew pose in front of the spaceship Mr Shkaplerov insisted that his entertainment-world crewmates are fully ready for the flight after their fast-track training.ldquoNo one had that experience before: to prepare people who had no relation whatsoever to the space programme for a space flight, he said.Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos, was a key driving force behind the project.Mr Rogozin described making the worldrsquos first feature film in space as a chance to raise the nationrsquos space prestige.ldquoMovies long have become a powerful instrument of propaganda, he said in June, arguing that the new film would help counter what he described as Western efforts to ldquohumiliate the Russian space programme.The Russian segment of the International Space Station is considerably less spacious compared to the US segment, leaving little room for filmmaking. It was expanded in July after the long-awaited arrival of the new lab module, the Nauka, which is yet to be fully integrated into the station.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

It was a rather small affair with a simple idea: guests would gather over coffee and donate the cost of their cuppa to Macmillan in the process. It was so effective, we did it again the next year – only this time nationally. Since then, Coffee Morning has raised over pound million for Macmillan.Event Organised Colette Rodgers said: “Our get together on Saturday was an opportunity to catch up over a cuppa and a slice of something delicious, along with some local storytelling, and all for a great cause.“One in two of us will face cancer, and the money raised at our Coffee Morning will make a local contribution to the great work done by Macmillan to help everyone with cancer to live le as fully as they can. “So, I want to thank everyone who supported our local event. Some helped set up, some washed dishes, some baked, some drank tea and coffee, some sold and bought raffle tickets. Some won prizes including vouchers from Millside Restaurant Gracehill Hair Sanctuary Ahoghill McAtamneys Greenvale Street Ballymena The Larder, and Redbrick Coffee Shop at Raceview Mill Broughshane. Other prizes included a beautul macrameacute wall art piece designed and created by Stacey Reidy of Celtic Knots and a Macmillan tea towel and apron. Our biggest donation of pound came from Liz Weir and friends, and we were honoured to hear Liz’s first live storytelling since March . We also thank Masako Carey for sharing a story of Japanese folklore”.The grand total raised was pound.

We were surprised at the big turnout, particularly as it was raining that morning.”One owner, who has had a caravan on site there for five years, said a £ hike meant their annual fee had now “jumped up to over £,” — not including a further £ yearly spend on gas, electricity and insurance.“In  my bill went up by %, then, the next year, it increased by %, by % the following year, then % and this year it’s % which is absolutely shocking,” they told this newspaper.“Some caravan owners are paying even more. The price rise is an insult.“Also, they won’t break down the bill to explain the increase, even though the site was closed for part of the year and the facilities were closed for most of it.”Mr Allister, a barrister, told the Belfastthat a large number of his constituents have caravans on that site, which houses around  caravans.“Under the Caravans Act, for caravan owners to have any clout they need to have a residents association which can come into existence has the support of more than %,” he said.“If and when it does come into existence the owner of the park is under statutory duty to consult with them about the future developments on the site and matters such as the pitch fees.“It was the absence of that that enabled the caravan owner to exert this exorbitant demand of a % increase so an essential starting point is for these folk to get themselves organised into an association.“The law is quite clear thatthe owner purports not to recognise it then there can be an order form the County Court compelling him to do so.“It’s a pretty foolproof way of making sure your voice is heard and has an input so that’s the starting point.”Mr Allister said he was “pleased to see that there was a sufficient response to enable an Association to go ahead”.He added: “In term of the current demand, solidarity is the key as to dealing with that. As in most other caravans the increase has been of the order of % so offering to pay that would keep them well within the bounds of reasonableness.”Last week this newspaper revealed that the owners of Golflinks — also known as Kelly’s – planned to increase annual fees by around %, which equates to between £ and £, a year extra per caravan.A Golflinks Holiday Homes spokesperson told the Belfastthey “understand and sympathise with caravan owners concerns with regards to the increase in pitch fees for ”.They added: “This was not an easy decision but was made in response to an increase in capital running costs facing us, and our investment programme into updating all of our facilities.”Golflinks Holiday Homes also “made a commitment to freezing an increment on our end in the pitch fees until  season”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNorthern Ireland hidden gem is named ‘eccentric hotel of the year’Derry ice-cream parlour boss apologises for logo’s ‘striking resemblance’ to Parachute Regiment insigniaBelfast City Marathon’s up and running…  miles and thousands of smilesStar witness in Michaela McAreavey murder trial found dead in MauritiusTroubled Katie axed from her Belfast gigTop VideosPlayVideo: #Frostbit Boy# Ruairi McSorley#s jive dance with Donegal teen goes viralPlay#Only in Dublin# – Bizarre clip of men removing couch from flat with brooms goes viralPlayTrial of Army veteran Dennis Hutchings over Troubles shooting to beginLatest Northern IrelandUnionist leaders come together at conference event to denounce NI ProtocolBelfast City Council: Bonfires, Universal Credit and the Holyland on the agenda for October meetingDennis Hutchings: Trial of ex-British soldier accused of attempted murder of ‘innocent vulnerable man’ with ‘mind of a child’ begins in BelfastCall for GAA review of closed door policy as club players remain locked out in the coldWatch: Cork comedian appears as ‘Shinner boy’ opposite ‘well-to-do’ Fine Gael TD in new sketchLatestNHS ramps up appeal for plasma donors as donation centres largely emptyPeople voice their frustration over losing money due to fuel shortagesJeremy Corbyn to thank for enabling Brexit, claims Rees-MoggJonas Eidevall hopes to get the ‘best version’ of Arsenal Women in BarcelonaUnionist leaders come together at conference event to denounce NI Protocol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Because our side who hated Brexit would have accepted any other Labour leader as interim prime minister to stop Brexit and have a second referendum etc.“And any other Labour leader might have accepted one of our side to be an interim prime minister to stop Brexit.“But Jeremy Corbyn was unacceptable to Tories who would simply not, however much they hated Brexit, have him as leader, and there was absolutely no way he was going to make way for anybody  – and therefore we got to an election and won it handsomely because the people wanted what they voted for to be delivered.“But without Jeremy Corbyn’s obduracy, stubbornness, we might not have got it – and I think it came very close to not happening.”Mr Rees-Mogg went on to describe Sir Keir Starmer as a “very respectable second-rate leader” of the Labour Party.He said: “I mean that nicely. We want to have a respectable Opposition.“He, on the charisma stakes against our leader, doesn’t rank particularly highly.”Mr Rees-Mogg drew upon his love of cricket when he said: “If Boris Johnson is Donald Bradman then I think Keir Starmer is Chris Tae,you remember him,you’re a cricketing fanatic, he played for Somerset for a bit and always scored quite quickly for Somerset and less so when he played for England.“Butis a decent and respectable inidual. He is not going to impose a Communist state on us.”Mr Rees-Mogg added: “He isn’t Tarzan swinging through the jungle enthusing everybody with excitement, is he  No.”He later compared Mr Johnson’s former senior adviser Dominic Cummings to Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort.Asked whether the Government believes in the right of iniduals to make informed decisions for themselves, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Yes, of course.“That is fundamental to what we believe.“And one of the things that I thought we could all take a great deal of comfort from were the leaks, the revelations of one Dominic Cummings. You may remember him, a sort of Voldemort of the Tory Party.”He went on to claim Mr Johnson wanted to “protect freedom at every step of the way” during the Covid pandemic.Mr Rees-Mogg’s interview concluded with a question about how much he loves Cadbury Creme Eggs.He replied: “Oh goodness. Ten. They are the most supreme snack, aren’t they “They’ve got everything about them. They are health-giving, unquestionably, they provide you with an important part of your caloric intake for the day.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

A legally binding commitment was made by Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by the end of the decade. According to a new sustainability study conducted by Empathy Research in June this year, % of businesses are doubtful theyll achieve these goals. googletag.cmd.push The study also found that % of companies claim they dont have science-based emissions targets, while a further % dont knowtheir targets are science-based or not. This is despite the fact that % of businesses believe their sustainability efforts have positively impacted their bottom line. Commenting on the studys findings, Head of Sustainability at EY, Stephen Prenille, said, Businesses have a very real responsibility to take charge of the role they can play in addressing the global climate change crisis. He continued: [They]need to proactively consider the cost-saving benefits of sustainable practices from the get-go and build them into financial planning. It doesn’t undermine sustainability efforts to draw a connection to long-term profitability, on the contrary, it supports its adoption and longevity.” Forty percent of respondents to the study said they will seek support in the next six to twelve months to help improve sustainability efforts.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It may be le itself that has caused this loss. Past hurts, traumas and grief. Although it may be challenging, I invite you to think for a moment, what the very word “passion” means to you. Maybe it is a hobby or interest, a relationship, your passion for your children, your career or maybe most importantly, the passion you have for the relationship you nurture with yourself. Or maybe, there is a nothingness that presents itself. googletag.cmd.push Maybe you have memories of past passions, past hobbies, past relationships, lost loved ones or the lost version of yourself that you deeply miss. I would suggest that there is a trauma that exists with losing your passion or passions in le. To grieve a past role you played in someone ’s le possibly or maybe even your own. There is a loss that exists. Recognising that it is, indeed a loss, is a huge step in the process of finding one’s self again. Recognising this, may be hurtful. We may relish the times that have passed. The things we feel we may not have the time for anymore or it may not be a feeling but a reality we succumb to. Once we recognise this loss of self, the next step is a process of acceptance. This may not be a quick fix or the flick of a switch so to speak. It may be a long, laborious process where we can tend to dwell on the past and the “good times” that have passed. Is there any way of getting around this  To say that there is a quick way of doing so, would not honour the space that is needed in this loss.     It truly does need the breathing space which is a timely and robust effort. However, once you do this inner work, the pay off is ten fold. Look, things won’t ever be “the same” again and to act like they will be would firstly be a lie and secondly delusional. How could they possibly be  Think about it. With all of your experiences to date, how could you go back to your former self  It is simply not possible. I would suggest that in the present moment we can make better choices that can result in a future that leads to fulfilment, joy, happiness and brings us to an even better place. That is not optimistic, innocent, naivety or wishful thinking. There is a science behind it for starters but also it is common sense. If you do the same things over and over again and expect a dferent result or expect things to be like they used to be, you are surely on a road to disappointments and perceived “failure”. If, however, you start to inject small steps into your le where you make time for the endeavours you find most passionate, there is hope. If this resonates with you or speaks to you, then I invite you today, not tomorrow or next week, to find time for something you are passionate about. Evenit is five minutes. So what. Time is on your side and this is not a race. The most important relationship we have in this le is with ourselves. Foster it. Nurture it. Go easy with it . Tend to the garden of your le. It is too short for endeavours we don’t enjoy. But what about “responsibility” I hear you say. What about the job I work every day to put food on the table and pay my bills  Look, we always have choices. Evenit doesn’t seem like it today. There is always another job. There is always another bus. It is up to you which bus to take. By finding time for your true passions you are giving yourself the priceless gt of time, experiences and memories. When we sit on our deathbeds and look back at le , we will not think about the days we put down at work. Reframe it. Those days give us a chance to create memories with our families, with ourselves. Ever hear the saying: “Live today asyou will die tomorrow”. I believe that is BS. We need to plan for weeks, months and years ahead. However, it does have merit in that we should enjoy today. Embrace the day or seize the moment - Carpe Diem. So why wait  Yes, there are challenges ahead. For some, the biggest challenges we may face in our lives. But take these challenges on and remember to make time for yourself in the process. Don’t, ever, lose your passion and zest for le. So I invite you today, not to forget about the past, the past is a very important part of our lives. I invite you to acknowledge it deeply, to realise the loss of the past but to also realise things will not “be the same again”. Embrace today, for its wins, for its losses, either way there is always something to be learned. I will leave you with a quote from the famous ancient Greek philosopher Socrates who said: “The unexamined le is the le not worth living.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

In an emotional and truly moving interview with Miriam O’Callaghan on RTEacute Radio  on Sunday, Geraldine Mullan said she was ultimately grateful to have survived the crash in which her family drowned as it allowed her to say goodbye to her husband and two children and to work to keep their memories alive. googletag.cmd.push In August , Geraldine’s husband Johnand her children Tomaacutesand Ameliadied when the family’s car plunged into Lough Foyle at Quigley’s Point on their way home from a family day out. She described the days before the tragedy, the aftermath and the steps she had taken to honour the memory of her family. Thereports on how the oncology nurse said she looked back at the early part of last year’s Covid lockdown when she was off work with a back injury and her husband’s garden centre was closed as “precious family time”. “It was simple things like a sleepover in the back garden or movie time or during our lovely coastal walk along the shore path… precious time with my beloved three”. Geraldine said on the day of the crash she and her husband were both off work and had planned a day outdoors but the weather was bad in the wake of Storm Ellen so the family had gone to Derry for bowling, a trip to the cinema and dinner instead. “It was just a lovely day out, we watched the Snow Queen and got the iniable popcorn and ice cream and then we did the bowling and then we had dinner.     She said she has “beautul memories” of the family, laughing and joking and planning what they were going to do for the rest of their family time. The crash happened on their way home. “I would have heard that saying that your le can change in a second and unfortunately for me on that night of August th, my le changed forever. It was the perfect storm, everything went against us and unfortunately I was the only one that ... managed to survive.” She said when the emergency services did reach the car, they held on to her. “I will admit there was a time I didn’t want [them] to hold on to me because I knew I’d lost everything. I knew by the time help came that unfortunately it wasn’t going to be a rescue, it was just going to be a search for John, Tomaacutes and Amelia. So at one point I just asked him to ‘let me go’.” She said the rescue worker apologised and said: “Geraldine, I can’t let you go.” She praised “the valiant efforts of every single one of those emergency service [who] put their lives at risk and worked tremendously hard and found my beloved three so I could bring them home and I could say goodbye to them. “I got to see my beloved family one last time and I got to bring them home, to have my couple of nights at home with them before the funeral on the Monday and before I said goodbye to them.” She said now she was focused on trying “to keep doing the best I can for John, Thomas and Amelia. … they were just so full of love and le and unfortunately all their lives were cut short abruptly on that night.” She said when Thomas and Amelia were found, the boy was holding his baby sister. “He was the kindest, gentle boy.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication.

Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute vs. Knockbreda Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium Today, pm  Six wins in seven games has perhaps changed the perception of Institute in recent weeks, with Brian Donaghey’s team now going into games as favourites to win. That winning mentality has seeped into the players ever since Donaghey’s arrival, and after six wins in seven games in all competitions, there is new le about a club which was on the floor just a month ago. googletag.cmd.push They are the form team in the Lough  Championship, with no other team managing four winning four of their last five league games and they are now expected to beat Knockbreda today and move even further up the table. That change in mindset is a challenge in itself according to Donaghey. “I challenged the players last week because for the Queens match, people thought they were favourites, probably for the first time, and I asked ‘How do you cope with this ’,” he admitted. “We started very, very poorly and it took us  minutes to get to grips with it. That will happen in the Championship I don’t think there’s a massive dference between bottom and second bottom, and top and second. Some of the results would prove that because the top teams are getting beaten by the bottom teams.” Donaghey admits he is surprised that results have improved so dramatically in such a short space of time, but puts the upturn in fortunes down to the players themselves. “If you were to say we would win six out of seven, I would have been surprised considering the fact that they lost their previous four and conceded  or  goals,” he said. “It has been a good turn round and it’s been down to the application of the players, giving them a wee bit of belief, and getting them enjoying their football again and giving them a bit of structure and getting them a wee bit more organized. The players take full credit for taking on everything we’ve asked of them.     “Working hard is a given. They are taking on board any information they are given which is good. It’s a thing you get with young players where they want to learn, and they have good learning capabilities, which is brilliant start for any manager or coach. “Getting the results also has given them that wee bit of belief. We’re embracing it, but we’re not getting ahead of ourselves.”  Brilliant Benny Benny McLaughlin was the hero again for ‘Stute last week, scoring yet another winning goal to take his tally for the season to six. He has been a massive factor in ‘Stute’s winning run. “Benny is a threat, and he will tell you in hindsight he should be sitting on double figures because he’s had quite a few chances,” Donaghey continued. “He’s a bit of a talisman at the moment, and even though his girl had a baby last week, he was the first one to say he would be there for the game. I just thought that was something I’m trying to recreate in the squad, that we’re a family and we will pull each other out when we need it and we’ll do things together and enjoy the good days together and we’ll get through the hard days as well. I’m pleased for Benny, but he’s only as good as the service he’s getting from the players around him as well.” Favourites they may be this time, but Donaghey knows that means little in such a competitive ision. “If you’re not on it % in any game in this league, you’ll get found out,” he said. “We just want to get a bit of momentum and hope that whatever information the players get they can act on. We aren’t getting too far ahead of ourselves we want to accumulate as many points as we can between now and Christmas and then we’ll see what we need, and maybe look for a few players in certain areas.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Four defeats and even more injuries have given coach Richard McCarter plenty of headaches, and the club veteran admits he has never quite seen anything like this in his time at Judges Road. googletag.cmd.push “In terms of injuries and bad luck not really, no,” he admitted. “Anything that can go wrong has gone wrong in terms of injuries and we just haven’t really caught a break. There’s no point dwelling on that, we have to continue with what we’ve been given and keep trying our best under the circumstances. We have a bit of positivity on the injury front this week so we’re hoping we can get a stronger back line together and attack the game with more positivity.” It will be hard to shake the Ulster League losses of recent times, particularly the heavy home defeats to Bangor and Omagh. But McCarter believes they have to put that all behind them as they prepare for the bread and butter of the All-Ireland for the first time in  months. “We have probably gone through every emotion in the last four games in the Ulster League but evenwe had won all four all those, it sort of counts for the same because no-one judges you on your Ulster League results, it’s all about the All-Ireland,” he explained. “We just have to see this as a fresh start, draw a line under what’s happened and just be really positive this week. We’re away from home which is always dficult, but it means that we can go down there relatively pressure-free and just have a good crack at it and you just never know what can happenwe stay in the game and get off to a decent start.”     Changed times So much has changed since Derry’s last All-Ireland game, which was coincidentally against Tullamore back in February . That day at Judges Road, the home side came out as - winners, but that seems a dferent world to now, with new management, a new squad and new challenges. “It’s notoriously dficult to win away from home in the All-Ireland,” McCarter added. “That maybe concentrates us a bit better but regardless we have to go down there and see this as a fresh start. If we can get off to a good start and quiet the home crowd, they become jittery and our tails can go up, so it’s important we try to get off to a good start and maintain that. “It’s probably a fairly dferent team which will go out to the one which played them  months ago. We have got to be happy with the squad we’re taking down I have full confidence in those boys and see how we get on.” Given the circumstances, it would be impossible to predict how the season might go for City of Derry, and McCarter hasn’t even thought of setting a target, especially after coming through the last few weeks with plenty of collateral damage. “Genuinely I don’t have any targets,” he said. “We are just going to take every game as it comes I have learned in the last six weeks that anything can happen. I don’t want to put pressure on the players. We’ll focus on Tullamore this week then it’s about Enniscorthy next week.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKeeDerry NewsMan charged over unrest on night of Lyra McKee murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Brian Cassidy takes a score during Saturdays hurling semi final at Owenbeg.HomeSlaughtneil cruise past Lavey to book another Derry final spot overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derrys Millennium Forum.Derry NewsSnow Patrol to play acoustic set in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Bernard Gallagher, also known by Willie John, became a notorious household name in the s.Whats OnDocumentary explores the story of Derrys ‘lovable rogue’ Bernard Gallagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAWATCH: Magherafelt ladies manager Peter Youngs reaction on winning the intermediate title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

firm bids already lodged.Last month, the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surrounding its future and local planning officials announced they were considering taking legal action because the owners had exceeded the number of race meetings they were allowed to run.The current owner of the circuit, Mr David Beattie, confirmed yesterday afternoon that the complex is for sale, but he revealed he is currently working on a rescue package which he hopes will allow him to retain sole control.It has also emerged that he is due to

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation.

Now is the time to step up and support them by making it local. I would strongly encourage people from within the district to avail of the voucher and shop locally.Downpatrick businessman Darren Kearney, who is the owner of Oakley Fayre, said the business is pleased to be open to near full capacity again, which has only been made possible with the support of staff and loyal customers.ldquoThis has been a dficult time for many industries and the hospitality industry has been hit very hard, so we welcome any incentive or investment scheme that will help bring people onto their local high street, he said.Mr Kearney added: ldquoSupporting local gives back to the small, family-run businesses that are the foundation of the Northern Ireland economy.Stormont Economy Minister Gordon Lyons is encouraging local businesses to support the initiative.He said the ldquounprecedented scheme, which closes on November , is designed to boost businesses across the retail, hospitality and service sectors following the impact of the Covid- pandemic.He is urging all businesses to show their support to help maximise the benefits of the Spend Local cards and to use them wisely, supporting the local economy and communities as a ldquolittle spend can have a big effect.Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the scheme comes on the back of a very challenging period for retailers right across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe High Street Support Scheme is a welcome step in the long road to recovery for Northern Irelandrsquos retailers and I would encourage everyone in our industry to think hard about how they can encourage people to use their pound spend local card with their business, he said.ldquoIt should be remembered that p in every pound spent in an independent retailer is recycled around the local economy. If consumers make a special effort to spend their pound with local traders, then they will also be ensuring the money also goes towards invigorating the wider community.Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the impact of Covid- continues to present major challenges for the hospitality industry across Northern Ireland.ldquoThere is a great deal of uncertainty in the industry at the minute, he said.ldquoThe pandemic has had a devastating impact right across the sector.

This would help ensure that the centre of Strangford does not become a car park which happens regularly.Cllr Enright thanked residents for their support on the traffic issue in Strangford and confirmed that the Stormont department has accepted the traffic tailbacks causes problems and that the issue needs to be addressed.He said officials have allocated a small budget to employ additional staff to ensure that the dedicated ferry queuing area is utilised at peak periods to reduce congestion in the centre of the village.Cllr Boyle agrees that a permanent solution is required to address the queuing issue in Strangford.He continued: ldquoWe must promote tourism to its fullest potential on both sides of Strangford Lough. That means that we need structures in place that maintain a steady flow of traffic through both Strangford and Portaferry.ldquoWe simply cannot continue with Strangford village regularly coming to a standstill, with residents being seriously affected, creating a negative rather than positive impact on local businesses and le in general due to ferry traffic.Cllr Boyle said Strangford and Portaferry had much to gain from tourism, provided there were proper structures in place to deal with vehicles wishing to board vessels on either side of the lough.He said he has discussed the problem with Cllr Enright and they believe there is a simple, cost-effective solution to addressing the problem.Cllr Boyle said it is important that visitors and tourists have a positive, not negative experience of both villages, confirming that both politicians plan to progress the issue with senior Department for Infrastructure officials.He said they also hope to contact with Stormont Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Wheelchair beach access plan  ","story":"THE possibility of trialling floating wheelchairs at beaches across the district is being considered by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The move comes after the local authority was asked to address the lack of access to beaches for those with mobility problems and officers asked to look at potential solutions.A number of politicians say they recognise the need to do more to ensure beaches can be accessed by a wide range of people by providing floating wheelchairs and special matting to allow them to travel over sand to make it to the water.The issue was discussed at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee with officers agreeing to bring back a report for discussion next month.Initially, officials will examine access to Newcastle beach before focusing on others across the district.Local councillors Patrick Brown and Alan Lewis are spearheading the drive to provide improved beach access, especially as there a number of local facilities which have been awarded prestigious blue flag status which recognises their quality.In a report presented to members of the council committee last week, officers said they were currently investigating several options and a further report will be tabled in October.She also issued a reminder of ongoing consultation on so-called changing places provision which is designed to meet the needs of people with a range of mobility issues.Cllr Harte said not everyone in a wheelchair was mobile and would need a hoist. Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore. As councillors, we must challenge ourselves to ensure that our district is accessible and open to all by facilitating the extra provisions needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13069964.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He been excoriated either for being too much like a traditional unionist or for being weak kneed over the need for a pan-unionism electoral pact.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsThe latter critique, articulated quite forcefully and lucidly by Peter Robinson in this newspaper on Friday, needs further objective examination. Because in a sense any possible pre-election deal between Beattie’s party, Jeffrey Donaldson’s DUP or even Jim Allister and the TUV would be rendered as irrelevant unless a far greater electoral issues is not addressed: turnout.According to recent studies of elections and public attitudes in Northern Ireland it is an objective fact that unionists are more inclined not to vote compared to nationalists.In the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies’ comprehensive -page analysis of the  general election and its aftermath in Northern Ireland that gap was more than ten percentage points. Among those who said they prefer to remain within the UK .% admitted they were “non-voters”. The figure of “non-voters” among those who want to reuny with the rest of Ireland was .%. The overwhelming majority therefore of those not inclined to enter a polling station were unionists.The same study also broke down the percentages of those who didn’t vote by their normal party-political affiliations. The highest group who failed to turn up at the ballot box were those who said they supported the DUP. A whopping .% of DUP supporters said they didn’t vote this time around. This compares to Sinn Fein were only .% of their supporters failed to cast their vote. Perhaps surprisingly the next party to suffer from apathy among its supporters was the Alliance Party where .% Alliance minded citizens didn’t vote either.Other credible public surveys and opinion polls find a consistent dichotomy between strong majority backing across the board for the union and a declining support for the main unionist parties at election time. This cannot just be explained alone by a lack of co-operation between those parties and the shredding of the unionist ticket in ious constituencies, which is caused by too many pro-Union candidates standing. Political apathy of course plays a part especially in working class loyalist districts where all the social indices are negative and where a pervasive sense of hopelessness can take hold in communities. As an outside observer it has always struck me as a bewildering paradox as to why these communities can pour so much energy and time into building bonfires, forming bands, organising mass parades but many of them cannot be galvanised to even get onto the electoral register let alone bother to vote.Yet for many within loyalist areas where political apathy reigns there is also a sense of frustration over who to vote for. One of my closest personal friends who would not turn against meI described him as a true-blue loyalist who wears his unionismnot on his sleeve then at least on his Harrington jacket or parka coat. Although he has numerous nationalist and republican pals, as well as political agnostics like this one, my mate is unapologetic in his love of the Union. And yet he will openly admit that he hasn’t voted for years even though he has turned up at anti-protocol demonstrations and marches of late.When pressed as to why he is allergic to the ballot box, he explains that he has no one to vote for. He responds that the traditional unionist parties repel him given his social liberalism when it comes to issues like gay rights, abortion, mixed marriage etc. This man is under the age of  and his attitudes reflect those of a large proportion of younger pro-Union cohort of the population. They might get out and vote to remain within the UK in any future border poll but at present they are not fired up politically to cast a vote for the parties dedicated to preserving that Union.The haemorrhaging of the unionist vote of course cannot just be put down solely to voters like my liberal minded friend and many like him of his generation. However, the strategistswithin unionism should realise that it is not pacts or pre-election arrangements that will really reverse the trend of a declining vote for their parties. It is the failure to encourage pro-Union supporters especially in some of the staunchest loyalist areas across Northern Ireland to put their X or their ,,s on a ballot paper. That is surely the greatest task facing Donaldson, Beattie and Allister as fresh Assembly elections loom over the horizon.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In addition, senior Dublin government ministers have offered their support to families in Northern Ireland by calling for public inquires on behalf of nationalist victims of the British State.The hypocrisy in this approach is stratospheric.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorDublin’s policy in addressing — or more accurately not addressing — many of its own acts and omissions that directly propped up the IRA’s ethnic cleansing campaign, mercilessly waged against border Protestants, is outrageous. For years the Irish government blocked the extradition of terrorists to the UK. It operated a porous border and provided a safe haven for fleeing gunmen and bombers.It failed to address the presence on its territory of IRA training camps, bomb-making facilities and weapons caches, some of which were filled by Irish government ministers.And yet the Irish state persists to this very day in blocking justice for victims of its collusion with republican terrorists. My -year-old brother, Ian Sproule, was one such victim. Irish republican terrorists murdered Ian — a Protestant civilian — in a hail of  bullets outside our family home near Castlederg. There was a public outcry as Ian’s killing was the second murder by the IRA of a Protestant civilian in Castlederg in just eight months. Within days one of its members produced a Garda file to the media alleging he was a loyalist paramilitary. This  claim was made by the IRA in a warped attempt at justying murdering Ian. But you can’t justy an action built upon a lie, and you can never justy murder.The initial Garda-IRA collusion was the subject of a state-led cover-up. Dublin’s policy of obfuscation means the denial of justice for my brother continues.We welcome the motion brought to the assembly by Diane Dodds MLA on Tuesday September , and appreciate the support pledged to it in the assembly chamber. However it was disappointing that Alliance members saw fit to amend, and consequently dilute the original motion, without first consulting us, Ian’s family.John Sproule, Derg Valley Victims Voice——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Itrsquos like finding a lock and now we know the precise keys that will be necessary to unlock it.Prof Marin said the discoveries opened up ldquoan entire field of pharmacology and that researchers were already working to develop drugs to target the receptors they identied.He predicted that new treatments for pain would probably come first, but that knowing how the body detects changes in pressure could eventually lead to drugs for heart disease,scientists can figure out how to alleviate pressure on blood vessels and other organs.Last yearrsquos prize went to three scientists who discovered the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus, a breakthrough that led to cures for the deadly disease and tests to keep the scourge from spreading though blood banks.The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and a prize of more than one million US dollars.

But I think that once we achieve the goal, all that will seem not so dficult and we will remember it with a smile. vw,vw,px, px\"The crew members pose at the Russian launch facility Peresild said it was dficult for her to adapt to the strict discipline and rigorous demands required during the training.ldquoHere on Baikonur, we made friends with everyone and all people warmed up, she said. ldquoBut it was quite dficult in the beginning, when you arenrsquot given much choice: Just go, run, go faster, hold on, carry on. It wasnrsquot easy for us and it was quite unexpected, but we have gone through it.She said learning about the design and handling of the spacecraft was the most challenging part of the preparation for the flight.     ldquoIt didnrsquot come easy for me, to be honest, she said. ldquoFor the first two weeks, I was learning it until four in the morning every night. There are so many acronyms, andyou donrsquot learn them all you wonrsquot understand anything  further on.The part of the training that Peresild liked the most was a flight imitating weightlessness, in which a plane goes into a steep e to allow those inside about  seconds in zero gravity.She added that she realises that zero gravity in orbit could be completely dferent and is gearing up for her first morning in orbit. vw,vw,px, px\"Actress Yulia Peresild ldquoSome mornings could be dficult, even on Earth, she said. ldquoWe thought a lot about it, and cosmonauts shared some le hacks.Shipenko, , has made several commercially successful movies, including Kholop, a  movie that set a Russian box office record. He also described the training as tough.ldquoOf course, we couldnrsquot make many things at the first try, and sometimes even at a third attempt, but itrsquos normal, he said.One of Shipenkorsquos previous films, Salyut-, told the real story of a challenging  mission of two Soviet cosmonauts sent to resuscitate an abandoned space station.He described the four-month training course as very intensive, adding that while it did not turn him and Peresild into professional astronauts it made them well prepared for the mission.Shipenko said he is thrilled to be the first filmmaker in space and is keen to experiment with lighting, camera settings and other technical aspects. Once on the space station, Shipenko said he will don a T-shirt that he always wears when he begins to shoot a new movie. vw,vw,px, px\"The crew pose in front of the spaceship Mr Shkaplerov insisted that his entertainment-world crewmates are fully ready for the flight after their fast-track training.ldquoNo one had that experience before: to prepare people who had no relation whatsoever to the space programme for a space flight, he said.Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos, was a key driving force behind the project.Mr Rogozin described making the worldrsquos first feature film in space as a chance to raise the nationrsquos space prestige.ldquoMovies long have become a powerful instrument of propaganda, he said in June, arguing that the new film would help counter what he described as Western efforts to ldquohumiliate the Russian space programme.The Russian segment of the International Space Station is considerably less spacious compared to the US segment, leaving little room for filmmaking.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
